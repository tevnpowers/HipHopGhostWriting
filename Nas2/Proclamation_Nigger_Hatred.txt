This is my opening scripture - I've been preparing this album
My whole life, might be uncomfortable for most you listeners
Satan's bombarding me with propositions, but I decline
I started in the Bridge without a pot to piss in
I overcame all the opposition
My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison
Cloaked in the finest drapes, not bathe in napes
But we still filthy, Supreme Court say we still guilty
This is the Genesis, and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis
I get loose like the Jena Six, they put a noose on 'Pac
Now I'm defending Vic, and free that nigger TIP
I'd take the grave or a bid
To let some dirty clan members run up in my crib
And plant cracks on the man that's going to church
Plants packs on the man that's going to work
And build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers
Is recruiting all my brothers and cousins to fill bases
The nerve of y'all to call Escobar racist
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger hatred
