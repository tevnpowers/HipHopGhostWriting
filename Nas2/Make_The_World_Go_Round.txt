Laced and Macy's don't have it, a hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around, or I'm wastin' fabric
I don't feel greater 'til my plush pieces cause you to suck your teeth
So mean-muggin' on my clean-thuggin' mean nothin'
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry-writing Russian, ice disgusting
I started bling, how could you question my direction?
Or my Tom Ford collection
Gangstas two-steppin'
You hate me, should thank me, but lately
I burned so much trees, I keep environmentalists angry
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder, your best success is my worst blunder
Y'all living trendy on pennies, I cop plenty Fendi
Vivienne Westwood, I'm good
Get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the hood
Dre & Cool, we ridin' heavy
N.Y. to Miami, cause, we make the world go round

Now let's toast to the hustlers
(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas
(We make the world go round)
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers
(We make the world go round)
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us
(We make the world go round)

(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas
(We make the world go round)
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers
(We make the world go round)
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us
(We make the world go round)

We start with Bellini's and end with Patron shots
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart
Alife tag popper, it'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags
Worth a hundred cash shoppin'
Violence only when have to, have to to swell you up
Prefer pea snaps, Perrier-Jouet, a vanilla dutch
Mets cap, that's Queens; I'm a vet, bet that
300 carats the average up on the neck, black
Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche
Top down, new fashion
Seein' me is like seein' through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera light
Flashin'
And I'm laughin', my plaques' from album sales
Y'all is ringtone platinum, but ninety-nine cents adds up
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em
The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track, what

Now let's toast to the hustlers
(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas
(We make the world go round)
Tell them gangstas, toast to the ballers
(We make the world go round)
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us
(We make the world go round)
