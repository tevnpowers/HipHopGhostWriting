If all I saw was gangsters comin up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung ta
Claim ta I mold myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap I'm a monster
Streets deceiving they can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata persona's that of a non-needer
Because I don't need nada except for prada beaver
For cold winters tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
To my g's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix caked up
Tryna take what I'm eatin came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this savvy mouth
Wild hardly a man's man who woulda knew
The beach houses and wild parties
Jezebel's and stella mccartney's
For years all that how could I not be dead?
This old german said I was a thug with a notty head
Looked at my benz and called that a nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see
From my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme my stories is
I'm from the home of the thieves

Blessed the lord is a g he gotta be
Who's the god of suckers and snitches the economy
Lipstick from marilyn monroe blew a death kiss to fidel castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder black cop cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers athletes and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances trends and fashion?
But when it comes to residuals they look past us
Woven into the fabric they can't stand us
Even in white tee's blue jeans and red bandannas

Assassinations diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people built a new nation
Involuntary labor took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700's
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
Love to sit in on the senate and tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair she read about herself in the bible
Believin she the reason sin is here
You played her with an apron like bring me my dinner dear
She's the 'nigger' here ain't we in the free world?
Death penalty in texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity I'm in the double-R casually
Buggin how I made it out the hood dazzle me
How far we really from third world savagery
When the empire fall imagine how crazy that'll be
