In America you'll never be free
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe?

Braveheart, still QB's Finest
Grinding, enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shining, you can see a nigga breathe

Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis
Cruise with the hammer, jealous heart, they can't stand him
Haters are scandalous, damn, can't a nigga just breathe?

To all my niggas getting money in the streets
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Light up my trees, and I just breathe

I twist 'em, baby mama beef victim
Chronic leaf hittin', all kinds of heat with him, wisdom
From pot to piss in to high position
Intense hustle, it's pain like a pinched muscle
'Til it rains and my Timbs stain my socks
'Til I dodge enough shots, and the presiding judge slams a mallet
And says life I'mma guap, then I cop
Then I yacht, Then I dock
Island hopping away from nightmare holders
Or cowboy slingers who shoot up any club
That see they names ring loud on some FBI poster
Must be on Ex or he coked up, suggesting I post a
Bail, I'm like yes, cause we soldiers
We just getting older, in time, we still in our prime
I can't afford a new arrest on my folder
Nigga breathe

In America you'll never be free
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe?

Braveheart, still QB's Finest
Grinding, enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shining, you can see a nigga breathe

Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis
Cruise with the hammer, jealous heart, they can't stand him
Haters are scandalous, damn, can't a nigga just breathe?

To all my niggas getting money in the streets
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Light up my trees, and I just breathe

I'm fresh out of city housing, and have too many options
Pennies on a pension or penitentiary bounded
Plenty henny in me, envy was simply they trend, see
My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me
The high life, the fly life
Pierre Hardy, imitation of Christ
Ice-wear gaudy, since '94 flossy
The Lex was an excellent choice, now fast forward me
The pestilence of the ghetto informed me
As a shorty, to push nothin' less than a 740
With fresh linens, sip Pellegrinos with Airs on
They sick, mixing they water with airborne
