Chain gleaming, switching lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in
So in God's Son we trust
Cause they know I'm gonna give em what they want
They looking for a hero, I guess that makes me a hero

Another chapter of the cleanest rapper, distinguished gentlemen
Crooks and Castle on his back, Maybacher
Exotic lady eye-catcher, holla at ya, call me the chiropractor
Working like Muay Thai class, get perspire out ya
And of course I've been the boss since back when
Rocking D Boy, Fila, velour in one-ninety black Benz
Now they shut down the stores when I'm shopping
Used to be train robbing, face covered in stocking - I'm him

Chain gleaming, switching lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in
So in God's Son we trust
Cause they know I'm gonna give em what they want
They looking for a hero, I guess that makes me a hero

Rubber-grip-holder, reloader, come at me
I'ma rip your soliders in half, silverback ape, nickel-plated mag
Young, rich and flashy; young bitch, I'm nasty
All black clothes 'til ice lay on me so classy
And every time I close my lids
I can still see the borough, I can still see the bridge
I can still see the dreams that my niqqas ain't never lived to see
Tell them angels open the door for me
From nine Berettas and movin' raw to chilling in wine cellars
Sticks and humidors, that's what I call mature
That's what I call a G, that's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta, to the fullest shit
I try to make more cream
By every September 14th, that's my dream
So I can be more clean, as I grow yearly
I can see things more clearly, that's why they fear me, let's go

Chain gleaming, switching lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in
So in God's Son we trust
Cause they know I'm gonna give em what they want
They looking for a hero, I guess that makes me a hero

This universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied, the corporate side
Blocking y'all from going to stores and buying it
First L.A. and Doug Morris was riding with it
But Newsweek article startled big wigs, they said Nas why is he trying it
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winning
Forgetting Nas the only true rebel since the beginning
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try telling Bob Dylan, Bruce, or Billy Joel they can't sing what's in their soul
So Untitled it is, I never change nothing, but people remember this
If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids
With new ideas being told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'mma drop it
Like it or not, you ain't gotta cop it
I'm a hustler in the studio, cups of Don Julio
No matter what the CD called, I'm unbeatable y'all, let's go
