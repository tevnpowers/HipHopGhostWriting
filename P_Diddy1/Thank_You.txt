You've always been right there to let me know everything's alright
Whenever darkness came my way You were my light
I wanna thank You for the difference in my life
Can't even count the reasons why ( ohhh I)

I lift you up and praise Your name
You gave me strength to see another day
When I was lost, You helped me find my way
When it seems I can t face another day( That's when I call on.....)

You-- In time trouble, faced with struggle I call no one but ..
You-- When I'm feelin lonely, no one around me still I call on ..
You-- You always placed Your arms around me when I needed..
You-- Thats why I sing this song to tell You
Lord I do love You

You are the only one who keeps on blessing me
At times, I thought that I was blind You helped me see
(Oh ho) And I can never pay You back for all You've done
Thats why I serve You faithfully and never give You up

I lift you up and praise Your name
You gave me strength to see another day
When I was lost you helped find my way
When it seems I can't face another day
That's when I call on..

You-- In time trouble, faced with struggle I call no one but ..
You-- When I'm feelin lonely, no one around me still I call on ..
You-- You always placed Your arms around me when I needed..
You-- Thats why I sing this song to tell You
Lord I do love You

Knock and He will answer
The lord will make a way
He's worthy of his praise

I know life is worth living
Becasue of you Jesus
I always call on You

You-- In time trouble, faced with struggle I call no one but ..
You-- When I'm feelin lonely, no one around me still I call on ..
You-- You always placed Your arms around me when I needed..
You-- Thats why I sing this song to tell You
Lord I do love You

All I wanna do
All I wanna do I
