Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly, with his song telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly, with his song

One time, one time, (one time) hey yo L you know you got the lyrics
I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him and listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
(One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words
(Two times, two times)

Killing me softly with this song, killing me softly
With his song, telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters then read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
(One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words
(Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly, with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly, with his song

Yo L-Boogie, boy L boy L, take it to the bridge

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Yes he was singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
