O.P.P., how can I explain it
I'll take it frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumping, shouting, saying it
O is for other, P is for peoples', scratch your temple
The last P, well that's not that simple
It's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it’s her girlfriend’s or her cousin’s house?!
It’s not a front, a F to the R to the O to the N to the T;
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
Boy, that’s why she’s scary!
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at
Who think it's wrong cause I was splitting and co-hitting that
Well if you do, that's O.P.P. and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
Who’s down with O.P.P.? [Every last homey!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
Who’s down with O.P.P.? [All the homies!]

Well, for the ladies O.P.P. means something different
The first two letters' the same but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhyming with "cleanness" or "meanness"
I won't get into that, I'll do it ah sorta properly
I'll say the last P hmmm stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me
Now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife
And you just had to stop a toast cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway!
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'.
Now don't be shocked cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. [O.P.P.!] I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
Who’s down with O.P.P.? [Every last lady!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah, you know me!]
Who’s down with O.P.P.? [All the ladies!]

A scab tried to O.P.P. me
I had a girl and she knew that. Matter-of-fact her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment
Bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, "Let's go, my girl is coming so you gotta leave."
She said, "Oh no, I love you, Treach!" I said, "Now, child, please!
"You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go!"
I said, "Now look you chooses stairs or chooses the window
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have brought your heart
Cause you know I was OPP, hell from the very start!"
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round running off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him!
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her for sure ain't going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy I'm with it

You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah you know me!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah you know me!]
You down with O.P.P.? [Yeah you know me!]
Who’s down with O.P.P.? [This whole party!]
