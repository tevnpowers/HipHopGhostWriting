It's Bad Boy bitch
Do it do it do it do it
Do it do it do it do it
(It feels good to be back, I missed ya)
Relax your mind, let your conscious be free
And I roll with the sounds of BBE
Do it do it do it do it
Do it do it do it do it
(You know what time it is)
(Report to the dance floor)
It's bad boy bitch
(Talk to 'em)

You know what it is, I'm back in the building
Security strapped, still stackin a million
Stunt with a stallion, somethin Italian
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris
I'm in it to win it but willin to carry
The game, if you think I'm not, look at the carats
Hop up clean up outta the Phantom
The people go screamin like an opera anthem (let's go)
I did it before, do it again
I got it to blow, got it to spend
Fly as befo', cool as the wind
Got hits go back like Juice and Gin, yeah
Shine the best and diamond necklace
My extravagant taste, the style perplexes
They know I'm the shit, they wanna get next
That's why she havin a fit cause she wanted to get next to him

Anywhere I appear, they all stop and stare
Admire your body language speakin loud and clear like
(I want you to come be with me)
She be waitin anticipatin for oh so long
Fantasizing wild thoughts of me comin on like
(I'm here when will you make your move)
She diggin my style, my swag, my suede, my swerve
My way with words, the boy's absurd for sure
You can't fall 'til my aura call her
I make miracles like I walk on water
What you want mama order, it's on my tab
I'm so bad with the cash, I dropped a whole bag
Where you at girl?

Do it do it do it do it
Do it do it do it do it
Why don't cha come to me
I can be, what you need uh baby
I'm here, you're here, let's make it happen
Do it do it do it do it
Do it do it do it do it
Relax your mind, let your conscious be free
And I roll with the sounds of BBE
Do it, do it
You know what this is
It's Bad Boy bitch
