I know I make it hard to love me
But trust me
I could take you to places
That you ain't never been
Put you in purple labels
And that ferroin
Get your name engraved
On a weaderin
I'ma love you better
More than I ever did
Cause baby girl listen
Since you been here with me
Can't even lie
See the rider and your ambition
Providin' me with the fire
When you wet and drippin'
Mama if you see if you different
Go 'head and get it
And I ain't sayin' if you leave me
It'd be better
But me and you together
Honey we could do whatever
Let's do it
I made it hard
I admit it it's true
I need to hear somethin'
I'm listenin' boo

I know I'm hard to love
Let's rock

Lemme talk to you one more time girl
You always sayin' that I don't want you to hurt
You always complainin'
But I was makin' it worse
Besides all the games that I's kickin' at first
It's time to explain
My mind's been in reverse
But now I think back
When nobody cared
And you was there
Just to roll by your man
And came back
Even know what I did
I realize and I'm aware
I know what it is
Put that on everything
Girl you my everything
I don't know where I'd be
Cause you the air I be
If lovin' is wrong
Who could be right
I wouldn't know what to do
Without you in my life
You're more to me than the world I pray
The more nights for your heart to break
Right in the middle of the dawn of day
I think of all the pain I caused
And throw it away and say
I need you in my life
Can you feel it in your soul

I know it's hard to love me
That don't mean I don't love you
Hey rich
I love the way you got Harlem singin'
Mary take us home
