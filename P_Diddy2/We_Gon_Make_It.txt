As my, Daytons spin lowrider sittin low
Hittin corners so hard you can taste my rims
Hard top six-four, I'm Diddy no tint
I can't hide in New York City
I'm 'bout it in the South, sleep good in the West
Know a chick from Watts with Bad Boy tatted on her breast
I done been there and did it (I done been there and did it)
Ten years without gettin sweat inside my Yankee fitted
1990-Raw I showed you ice
You ain't know who Jacob was so I showed you twice
When it was +All About the Benjamins+ I had two bezels on my arm
Like a Don's supposed to, Sean
Ride with a chaffeur in Gucci loafers
And switch to All Stars without losin focus
These rap niggas hopeless (hopeless) you can change the locks
But I'ma shine for niggas that ain't know Big

Tell me who shot Big (who shot Big)
And take the bullets out of 2Pac's ribs (take 'em out)
If I could I would reverse the car, reverse the beef
Put it all in a pot and boil it on a D. Dot beat (hit me baby)
Sometimes I get drunk, for stress relief
Other times I put "Life After Death" on and peep
We ride (we ride) what's a four door Bentley Coupe
Without my nigga on the passenger side?
And still I try (I try) to get money stay fly
Finish the race, holdin my crown high (take that)
I fly next to God, my eyes on the prize
Been away a long time but now I'm reenergized
(AS WE PROCEED) The life and times of a mastermind (c'mon)
Dedicate every breath to claim my designs (it's mine)
And the day I die, let a G4 fly
And dump my ashes over N.Y

I'm the King of all Kings, I abide by no rules
And do what I do by any means (c'mon)
Call him necessary, the great visionary
Born extrordinary, a life legendary
Who else put flows out, that put clothes out
Flee the cold weather, short sleeves with my toes out
Nine-six Big showed me what to do
But deep in my heart, this is "No Way Out II" (let's rock)
I spend absurd money, private bird money
That Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Bloomberg money (you know what it is)
Old habits die hard, the Vanguard award winner
New York torch gripper, O.G. of the floss nigga
I'm seein visions like I did a bag of angel dust
This is life when you black rich and dangerous
I'm with God, I'ma live on forever
Bad Boy for life bitch, nobody does it better (nobody)
