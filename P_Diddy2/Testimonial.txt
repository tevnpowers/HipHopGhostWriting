Through blocks and boroughs, cops is plottin
Snakes slither while hustlers chop they product
Foreign cars exotic, got hoes hypnotic
While I cruise through the concrete, blowin my chronic
And I move like a diplomat, hoodie and fitted caps
Dwell in the habitat where cons and killers at
Faced a thousand deaths, cowards'll bow to the feet
Of the almighty, a God to the black child
I told moms I would be somethin
I gave myself to the world now it's like you owe me somethin
Listen up, I got a story to tell
It's like I fell out of heaven just to walk through hell
It's what, fueled my fire, ignited my desire
You gave me the bricks and the sand to build the empire
Throw the seal on my forehead, my faith still strong
With all I've been through, you would think my faith gone
But nope, I hold my stance in stone
I move mountains with my will and succeed that's how I keep goin
Won't stop been the motto, feelin rich like I won the lotto
It's almost like seein through the eyes of a crack child
Dodgin crisis, three strike system niggas trapped in a vice grip
You can't defeat me, I defy all odds and sabotages
I survived Reagan, I survived the first Bush
Thinkin back when my moms gave that first push
Thank God for my life I came through the room
Until the evil of part two, when God gave me a sequel
Rags to royal, momma hand her hands in soil
Pops moved drugs in capsules and foils
I foiled your plans and made you aware
And turned America's dream into a nightmare
Yeah, you feel the vibe muh'fuckers
The first B.I., "Ready to Die" muh'fuckers
So "Who Shot Ya," 9 to 5 muh'fuckers
"Bad Boy for Life," is I muh'fuckers
And it's back, better than it ever was
I'm talkin like we was gone but we never was
So I deliver the truth uncut
We produce more hits got the booth fucked up
On top of the statue yellin "Who want what?"
For the past ten years, the future is us
(C'mon man) Eyes closed like I'm blowin reefer
The preview is over, now enjoy the future
