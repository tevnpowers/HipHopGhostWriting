Let me get an order
I got sumthin' for ya
You ever seen a black man
Walk on water?
Talk Shit to me
And I'mma try to ignore ya
Get Disrespectful
And I'mma have to come for ya
And I won't go get your lawyers
Cause my combo quick
They comin' like de la hoya
Watch Niggas in the streets
Cause they will come for ya

Don't ya wanna move
Does this make you groove?
Is the feelin good to you
It matters
Get ya Hot
Our music our music
Come enjoy the fun
Don't ya wanna move
Just make ya wanna groove
Does this feelin' get to you
Let Us get you Hot
Our music our music
Come enjoy the ride

Here we go back again
Makin' that beat go bump bump bump bump
So hard
Why do niggas act so hard
I don't give a damn about a broad
I ain't gotta floss in the fastlane
Ride right past lane
I'mma in the ATL
Flyin' down cascade
Still spendin' money
Ain't nothin' change man
Spend a couple mill
Just to make my change rang

Nah they ain't ready
They don't believe me yet baby
Y'all don't believe me yet?
