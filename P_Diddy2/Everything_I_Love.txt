The world at my sneakers
Gold pieces moulded with Jesus features
Give streets the fever from the way I spit the Ether
Came on the scene at 19 a gritty fiend for
Money, power, respect, get it by any means uh
New Yorker, slick talker, walk like a brick flipper
Decimal doctor, multiply to get richer
I'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city
I'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable diddy
I taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle
All in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle
I got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher
I got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture
My signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest
My first album through to him, that was my biggest project
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier
And when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja
You sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra
It's Harlem USA I diddy bop and shop with Oprah
(Yeah nigga, what.)

To the eye blacker, over handed face the palm smacker
Good scrapper, cat stacker, good wood packer
Tear up the Dom P wrappers faster
Platinum patrone splasher, fuck cris, spit atcha
I call it rich ignorant laughter
Black American express card all grey now, its scratched up
From constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags
Poppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra
Big roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya
Bring friends wontcha?
I'm from the 80's NYC 5 percent of culture
Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma
Wrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing
Slide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her
My persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne
Copping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar
Ferrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers
The studded chain around my neck makes the night colder
(Yeah nigga, what.)
