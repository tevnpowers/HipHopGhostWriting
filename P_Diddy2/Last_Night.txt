Last night (last night)
I couldn't even get an answer (Answer)
I tried to call (I tried to call)
But my pride wouldn't let me dial
(dial, dial, dial)
And I'm sitting here (sitting here)
With this blank expression (expression, expression, expression)
And the way I feel (way I feel)
I wanna curl up like a child (child, child)

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am
