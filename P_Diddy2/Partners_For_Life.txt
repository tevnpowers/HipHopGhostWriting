The day when I first seen you
You know I didn't stand, but I ain't mean to (yes you did)
Back then it wasn't oh so fair
You came through like some good clean air
Skin softer than the softest fabrics
You heard about me (I heard about you)
How I ball like the Dallas Mavericks
Sayin, anything you want, you can have it (give it to me)
That's Harlem World, I get on my grizzly savage see?
From the first day, we laid eyes on each other
At the office I knew we was gon' be lovers (I remember)
Mark hotel under the covers
You said I was cool and not like a lot of them brothers
Who used and abused you and took you for granted
See you a Goddess, that's why you was put on this planet (I love you)
Since you got me all sentimental

You're so amazin
All I can see is us now in the sun just grazin
Boo your brown complexion, I never seen a
Same color as coffee a teaspoon of creamer
'Member when I had the Beemer? Remember?
Goin through tough times and knowin the other side was greener
We had a dream, we pursued it
'Member that conversation, all or nothin before we lose it?
You remember - it's all words like music
Came at a time I needed soothin, soul body and mind
At times I felt violent, you kept me in line
Where-ever I went you wasn't far behind
Girl, we got a bond no one can break
And I'm sayin, I pray to God every night we make it - pray to God
I'm hooked and I don't wanna shake you - c'mon

Now sit back and reflect, on all our accomplishments
The mansions, the plush apartments and
The big boats and the cases of whole klicko
I don't ever wanna let you go
It's a certain kind of feelin, you know that feelin you get
When your girl right and you know what's what, uhh
You got me on some lay low stuff
You stood by me, all through that J-Lo stuff
Brush your shoulders off girl, go 'head and brush 'em
Without you around, I can't function
We gon' be together 'til the day we die
And when they put us in the ground we'll be side by side
I never had a girl make me feel like you
And every day I wake up, I feel brand new
I live for you and I'll die for you too
I love you girl
