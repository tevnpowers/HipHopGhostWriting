Run through sets
Come through sets
Chicks hypnotized by my 1, 2 steps
I'm way too fresh
So complex
Niggas try to predict what I'm gonna do next
Let's get the party started
Far from a motherfuckin' starving artist
Got something to prove
Don't talk it, walk it
My niggas outside on them walkie talkies
Pop that trunk
Pass that dutch
Let's get crunk
Baby don't play dumb
Baby don't say none
It's on me
Louie 13 and the cris on me
Dimes wall to wall in the vip
The age don't mean a thing
I ain't chi ali
I bring them out with no id
Them boys they bring them out like I'm T.I.P
