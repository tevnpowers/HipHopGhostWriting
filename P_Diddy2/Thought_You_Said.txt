The times that you weren't there
The times that you left me here
The times that I needed you
You know my love is true
My passions inside for you
The nights that I cried for you
A man has these feelings too
Same shit that shall go thru'
I been here before
Sometimes the pain you ignore
Until it's right at your door
And then you just can't take it no more
Why does love feel this way?
Why does it hurt so bad

The heartache and pain
Sometimes it goes to your brain
Sometimes it makes you insane
Sometimes our joy is our pain
Cuz it tears you apart
These affairs of the heart
I think I'm strong but I'm not
And when I look in ya eyes
You know it kills me inside
But I can't wait for that day
That you come back to me girl
After we both go away
It's just to see if it's real
There's no denying the fact
It's meant to be if you let it go
And then they come back
If this is our last dance we need to practice our steps
The situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept
You said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault
And of course you lost me with your alibis
And all of your talking
And most important I just question my self
