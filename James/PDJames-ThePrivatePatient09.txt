enough
seeing
their
caravan
parked
outside
the
gate
and
them
wandering
round
the
grounds
without
having
them
in
the
house
and
then
she
too
was
gone
mog
who
had
seated
himself
in
one
of
the
most
impressive
chairs
had
gazed
at
chandler
powell
throughout
but
had
remained
silent
now
he
heaved
himself
up
and
left
the
rest
of
the
group
waited
for
candace
return
but
after
half
an
hour
during
which
chandler
powell
not
to
discuss
sharon
inhibited
conversation
they
and
helena
closed
the
library
door
firmly
behind
them
the
three
days
of
the
week
when
no
patients
were
operated
on
and
george
chandler
powell
was
in
london
gave
candace
and
lettie
time
to
work
on
the
deal
with
any
financial
problems
with
the
temporary
staff
and
settle
the
bills
for
the
additional
food
necessary
to
feed
the
of
non
resident
nursing
staff
the
and
anaesthetist
the
change
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
manor
between
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
week
was
as
dramatic
as
it
was
welcome
to
the
two
women
despite
the
surface
calm
of
operating
days
the
mere
presence
of
george
chandler
powell
and
his
team
seemed
to
the
whole
atmosphere
but
the
days
before
he
left
for
london
were
of
almost
total
calm
the
chandler
powell
who
was
distinguished
and
surgeon
became
chandler
powell
the
country
content
with
domestic
routine
which
he
never
or
attempted
to
influence
man
breathing
in
solitude
like
air
but
now
on
tuesday
morning
the
fourth
day
after
the
murder
he
was
still
at
the
manor
his
london
list
and
he
himself
obviously
between
his
responsibility
to
his
st
angela
patients
and
the
need
to
support
the
remaining
staff
at
the
manor
but
by
thursday
both
he
and
marcus
would
have
gone
they
would
be
back
by
sunday
morning
but
reaction
to
even
temporary
absence
was
people
already
slept
behind
locked
doors
although
candace
and
helena
had
succeeded
in
chandler
powell
from
by
the
police
or
security
team
most
of
the
had
convinced
themselves
that
an
intruder
probably
the
owner
of
the
parked
car
had
killed
miss
gradwyn
and
it
seemed
unlikely
that
he
had
any
interest
in
another
victim
but
presumably
he
still
possessed
the
keys
to
the
west
door
thought
mr
chandler
powell
wasn
of
safety
but
he
was
the
owner
of
the
manor
their
go
between
with
the
police
authoritative
presence
on
the
other
hand
he
was
obviously
at
time
wasted
and
impatient
to
be
getting
on
with
his
job
the
manor
would
be
more
without
his
restless
footsteps
the
occasional
of
ill
humour
the
police
were
still
silent
about
the
progress
if
any
of
the
investigation
the
news
of
miss
gradwyn
death
had
of
course
broken
in
the
media
but
to
everyone
relief
the
had
been
surprisingly
short
and
helped
by
the
of
scandal
and
star
particularly
divorce
lettie
wondered
whether
some
influence
on
the
media
had
been
but
the
wouldn
last
for
long
and
if
an
arrest
were
made
the
would
burst
and
the
over
them
and
now
with
no
part
time
domestic
staff
the
patients
the
telephone
frequently
on
the
and
the
police
presence
daily
reminder
of
that
presence
which
was
still
in
imagination
locked
in
the
silence
of
death
behind
that
door
it
was
comfort
to
lettie
and
she
suspected
to
candace
that
there
was
always
work
to
be
done
on
tuesday
morning
both
were
at
their
desks
shortly
after
nine
lettie
through
collection
of
and
bills
and
candace
at
the
computer
the
telephone
was
on
the
table
before
her
and
now
it
rang
candace
said
don
answer
it
it
was
too
late
lettie
had
already
lifted
the
receiver
she
handed
it
over
it
man
didn
catch
his
name
but
he
sounds
he
asking
for
you
candace
took
the
receiver
was
silent
for
minute
then
said
we
re
busy
in
the
office
here
and
frankly
we
haven
time
to
after
robin
boyton
know
he
our
cousin
but
that
doesn
make
us
his
how
long
have
you
been
trying
to
reach
him
all
right
someone
will
go
round
to
the
guest
cottage
and
if
we
ve
got
any
news
we
ll
tell
him
to
ring
you
yes
ll
ring
back
if
we
ve
no
luck
what
your
number
she
reached
for
sheet
of
paper
took
down
the
number
then
replaced
the
receiver
and
turned
to
lettie
that
robin
business
partner
apparently
one
of
his
teachers
has
let
him
down
and
he
wants
robin
back
urgently
he
phoned
late
last
night
but
got
no
reply
so
left
message
and
he
been
trying
again
this
morning
robin
mobile
rings
but
no
answer
lettie
said
robin
may
have
come
here
to
get
away
from
phone
calls
and
the
of
their
business
but
then
why
not
turn
off
his
mobile
suppose
someone
had
better
take
look
candace
said
when
left
stone
cottage
this
morning
his
car
was
there
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
he
could
be
still
asleep
and
has
left
his
mobile
where
he
can
hear
it
dean
could
run
over
if
he
not
busy
he
ll
be
quicker
than
mog
lettie
got
to
her
feet
ll
go
could
do
with
breath
of
fresh
air
then
you
better
take
the
spare
key
if
he
still
sleeping
off
he
might
not
hear
the
bell
it
that
he
still
here
at
all
dalgliesh
can
him
without
cause
and
you
think
he
be
only
too
glad
to
get
back
to
london
if
only
for
the
fun
of
spreading
the
gossip
lettie
was
the
papers
on
which
she
was
working
you
dislike
him
don
you
he
seems
enough
but
even
helena
when
she
books
him
in
he
on
with
perfectly
one
probably
his
mother
got
herself
pregnant
and
subsequently
married
an
obvious
fortune
to
old
grandfather
disgust
anyway
she
was
cast
off
more
suspect
for
and
than
for
the
pregnancy
robin
likes
to
turn
up
from
time
to
time
to
remind
us
of
what
he
as
and
frankly
we
find
his
boring
we
do
hand
out
the
odd
from
time
to
time
he
takes
the
money
but
think
he
it
actually
it
for
both
parties
this
frank
disclosure
of
family
affairs
surprised
lettie
it
was
so
unlike
the
candace
she
knew
or
she
told
herself
thought
she
knew
she
took
her
jacket
from
the
back
of
her
chair
she
said
wouldn
he
be
less
of
if
you
gave
him
sum
from
your
father
estate
and
put
an
end
to
his
that
is
if
you
feel
he
has
genuine
it
did
cross
my
mind
the
difficulty
with
robin
is
he
always
want
more
doubt
whether
we
agree
on
what
sum
lettie
left
closing
the
door
behind
her
and
candace
turned
her
attention
again
to
the
computer
and
brought
up
the
figures
for
november
the
west
wing
was
again
in
profit
but
only
just
the
paid
covered
the
general
of
the
house
and
gardens
as
well
as
the
surgical
and
medical
costs
but
the
income
and
costs
were
rising
it
was
certain
that
the
next
month
figures
would
be
chandler
powell
had
said
nothing
but
his
face
taut
with
anxiety
and
kind
of
desperate
told
her
all
how
many
patients
would
care
to
occupy
room
in
the
west
wing
with
their
minds
filled
with
images
of
death
and
worse
the
death
of
patient
the
clinic
so
far
from
being
money
was
now
financial
she
gave
it
less
than
month
fifteen
minutes
later
lettie
returned
he
not
there
there
no
sign
of
him
in
the
cottage
or
the
garden
found
his
mobile
on
the
kitchen
table
among
the
remains
of
what
could
be
his
lunch
or
supper
plate
with
and
few
of
and
plastic
packet
which
had
held
two
chocolate
the
mobile
rang
as
was
the
door
it
was
again
told
him
we
were
looking
the
bed
looked
as
if
it
hasn
been
slept
in
and
as
you
said
the
car
outside
so
he
obviously
hasn
driven
off
he
can
have
gone
far
he
doesn
sound
like
someone
who
goes
in
for
long
country
no
he
isn
suppose
we
better
general
search
but
god
knows
where
we
ll
start
he
could
be
anywhere
including
suppose
comfortably
over
sleeping
in
someone
else
bed
in
which
case
he
hardly
likely
to
welcome
general
search
we
could
give
it
another
hour
or
so
lettie
said
is
that
wise
it
looks
as
if
he
been
gone
for
some
time
candace
considered
he
an
adult
and
to
go
where
and
with
whom
he
but
it
is
odd
seemed
worried
as
well
as
irritated
perhaps
we
should
at
least
ensure
that
he
not
here
in
the
manor
or
anywhere
in
the
grounds
suppose
it
possible
that
he
ill
or
has
had
an
accident
although
it
seems
unlikely
and
better
check
stone
cottage
not
very
about
the
side
door
and
he
may
have
in
after
left
to
see
if
there
anything
there
to
find
and
you
re
right
if
he
not
in
the
cottages
or
here
we
better
tell
the
police
if
there
serious
search
suppose
it
will
be
by
the
local
force
see
if
you
can
find
sergeant
benton
smith
or
dc
warren
ll
take
sharon
with
me
she
seems
to
be
hanging
about
doing
nothing
most
of
the
time
lettie
still
standing
thought
for
moment
then
said
don
think
we
need
to
sharon
she
been
in
an
odd
mood
since
commander
dalgliesh
sent
for
her
yesterday
and
some
of
the
time
and
looking
pleased
with
herself
almost
at
others
and
if
robin
really
is
missing
best
keep
her
out
of
it
if
you
want
to
the
search
ll
come
frankly
if
he
not
here
or
in
either
cottage
don
see
where
else
we
can
look
better
pass
it
on
to
the
police
candace
took
down
her
jacket
from
the
on
the
door
you
re
probably
right
about
sharon
she
wouldn
leave
the
manor
and
come
to
stone
cottage
and
frankly
it
was
relief
not
one
of
my
most
sensible
ideas
but
she
agreed
to
help
me
for
couple
of
hours
day
with
father
books
probably
because
she
wants
an
excuse
to
get
out
of
the
kitchen
she
and
the
bostocks
have
never
hit
it
off
she
seemed
to
enjoy
the
books
ve
her
one
or
two
she
seemed
interested
in
again
lettie
was
surprised
books
to
sharon
was
kindness
which
she
hadn
expected
from
candace
whose
attitude
to
the
girl
had
been
one
of
grudging
rather
than
interest
but
candace
was
after
all
teacher
perhaps
this
was
of
her
and
it
was
surely
natural
impulse
in
any
lover
of
reading
to
book
to
young
person
who
showed
an
interest
in
it
she
would
have
done
the
same
herself
walking
beside
candace
she
felt
small
of
pity
they
worked
together
as
both
of
them
did
with
helena
but
they
had
never
been
close
and
were
colleagues
rather
than
friends
but
she
was
useful
at
the
manor
the
three
days
candace
had
spent
visiting
toronto
couple
of
weeks
ago
had
proved
that
perhaps
it
was
because
candace
and
marcus
lived
in
stone
cottage
that
they
sometimes
seemed
as
well
as
physically
from
the
life
of
the
manor
she
could
only
imagine
what
the
last
two
years
had
been
like
for
an
intelligent
woman
her
job
in
and
now
so
it
was
no
longer
available
her
nights
and
days
spent
to
and
old
man
her
brother
desperate
to
get
away
well
there
should
be
no
difficulty
about
that
now
the
clinic
could
hardly
continue
after
miss
gradwyn
murder
only
patients
with
fascination
with
death
and
horror
would
book
in
at
the
manor
now
it
was
and
morning
there
had
been
heavy
during
the
night
and
now
from
the
sun
earth
there
rose
of
leaves
and
sodden
grass
had
come
early
this
year
but
already
its
had
faded
into
the
almost
breath
of
the
dying
year
they
walked
through
the
damp
which
struck
cold
on
lettie
face
and
brought
with
it
the
first
touch
of
unease
earlier
she
had
entered
rose
cottage
without
apprehension
half
expecting
to
find
robin
boyton
returned
or
at
least
some
evidence
of
where
he
had
gone
now
as
they
walked
between
the
winter
rose
bushes
to
the
front
door
she
felt
she
was
being
drawn
towards
something
which
was
none
of
her
business
which
she
had
no
wish
to
get
involved
in
and
which
ill
the
front
door
was
unlocked
as
she
had
found
it
but
entering
the
kitchen
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
air
was
now
more
than
the
smell
of
plates
candace
approached
the
table
and
regarded
the
of
the
meal
with
of
she
said
certainly
it
looks
more
like
yesterday
lunch
or
supper
than
breakfast
but
with
robin
who
can
tell
you
said
you
checked
upstairs
yes
the
bed
wasn
properly
made
just
the
pulled
together
but
it
didn
look
as
if
he
slept
there
last
night
candace
said
suppose
we
better
check
the
whole
cottage
and
then
the
garden
and
next
door
meanwhile
ll
get
rid
of
this
mess
the
place
she
picked
up
the
plate
and
moved
towards
the
sink
lettie
voice
seemed
as
sharp
as
command
no
candace
no
candace
in
her
she
went
on
sorry
didn
mean
to
shout
but
hadn
we
better
leave
things
as
they
are
if
robin
has
had
an
accident
if
something
happened
to
him
might
be
important
candace
returned
to
the
table
and
replaced
the
plate
suppose
you
re
right
but
all
this
us
is
that
he
ate
meal
probably
lunch
or
dinner
before
setting
off
they
went
upstairs
there
were
only
two
bedrooms
both
good
size
and
each
with
bathroom
and
shower
the
slightly
smaller
one
at
the
back
was
obviously
the
bed
made
up
with
clean
sheets
covered
with
candace
opened
the
door
of
the
fitted
wardrobe
then
closed
it
and
said
god
knows
why
thought
he
could
be
in
here
but
if
we
ve
come
to
search
we
might
as
well
be
they
moved
to
the
front
bedroom
it
was
simply
and
comfortably
furnished
but
now
looked
as
if
it
had
been
dressing
gown
was
lying
on
the
bed
with
crumpled
shirt
and
two
pairs
of
shoes
had
been
flung
into
corner
and
the
low
chair
was
heaped
with
jumble
of
and
trousers
boyton
had
at
least
come
prepared
for
the
worst
of
december
weather
the
wardrobe
door
was
open
to
reveal
three
shirts
jacket
and
dark
suit
was
the
suit
lettie
wondered
brought
to
be
worn
when
he
was
at
last
admitted
to
see
rhoda
gradwyn
candace
said
this
looks
like
either
fight
or
departure
but
taken
with
the
state
of
the
kitchen
think
all
we
can
safely
assume
is
that
robin
was
untidy
and
that
knew
already
anyway
he
isn
in
the
cottage
lettie
said
no
he
isn
here
and
turned
towards
the
door
but
in
one
sense
she
thought
he
was
there
the
half
minute
in
which
she
and
candace
had
the
bedroom
had
intensified
her
sense
of
now
it
had
into
an
emotion
which
was
mixture
of
dread
and
pity
robin
boyton
was
absent
but
he
seemed
more
fully
present
than
he
had
been
three
days
ago
when
he
erupted
into
the
library
he
was
here
in
the
jumble
of
clothes
in
the
shoes
one
pair
with
worn
down
heels
in
the
book
the
crumpled
shirt
they
moved
into
the
garden
candace
striding
out
ahead
lettie
although
usually
as
as
her
felt
as
if
she
were
being
dragged
behind
like
they
searched
both
cottage
gardens
and
the
wooden
at
the
end
of
each
the
one
at
rose
cottage
held
of
dirty
some
broken
and
of
thrown
together
on
shelf
with
no
attempt
at
while
the
door
was
partly
with
an
old
and
net
sack
of
wood
candace
closed
the
door
without
comment
in
contrast
the
shed
at
stone
cottage
was
model
of
and
impressive
and
their
metal
were
ranged
on
one
wall
while
the
shelves
held
arranged
in
order
and
the
was
clean
of
any
trace
of
its
there
was
comfortable
chair
with
checked
obviously
well
used
the
contrast
between
the
state
of
the
two
was
reflected
in
the
gardens
mog
was
responsible
for
the
garden
at
rose
cottage
but
his
interest
was
in
the
manor
gardens
particularly
the
knot
garden
of
which
he
was
proud
and
which
he
with
care
he
did
little
more
at
rose
cottage
than
was
necessary
to
avoid
criticism
the
stone
cottage
garden
showed
evidence
of
and
regular
attention
dead
leaves
had
been
swept
up
and
added
to
the
wooden
box
which
held
the
the
earth
and
against
remembering
the
chair
with
its
lettie
felt
surge
of
pity
and
irritation
so
this
the
air
of
which
felt
warm
even
in
winter
was
as
well
as
garden
shed
here
candace
could
hope
to
an
occasional
half
hour
of
peace
from
the
of
the
could
escape
to
the
garden
in
short
of
freedom
when
it
would
have
been
more
difficult
to
find
time
for
her
other
known
passion
from
one
of
her
favourite
or
candace
closed
the
door
on
the
smell
of
warm
wood
and
earth
without
comment
and
they
made
their
way
to
stone
cottage
although
it
was
not
yet
the
day
was
and
dark
and
candace
switched
on
light
lettie
had
been
in
stone
cottage
several
times
since
professor
westhall
death
always
on
the
business
of
the
manor
and
never
with
pleasure
she
was
not
her
faith
and
as
she
knew
it
to
be
had
no
place
for
the
rooms
in
which
they
had
unfinished
business
or
had
last
drawn
breath
but
she
was
sensitive
to
atmosphere
and
stone
cottage
still
in
her
an
unease
lowering
of
the
spirit
as
if
had
the
air
they
were
in
the
stone
room
referred
to
as
the
old
narrow
led
into
the
garden
but
the
room
was
virtually
and
seemed
to
have
no
except
as
for
furniture
including
small
wooden
table
and
two
chairs
looking
freezer
and
an
old
holding
of
mugs
and
they
passed
through
small
kitchen
into
the
sitting
room
which
was
also
used
for
dining
the
grate
was
empty
and
clock
on
the
otherwise
bare
mantelpiece
the
present
into
the
past
with
irritating
the
room
was
except
for
wooden
settle
with
to
the
right
of
the
fireplace
one
wall
was
covered
with
to
the
ceiling
but
most
of
the
shelves
were
empty
and
the
remaining
fell
against
each
other
in
tightly
packed
cardboard
boxes
of
books
were
ranged
against
the
opposite
wall
where
of
paper
showed
where
pictures
had
once
hung
the
whole
cottage
although
very
clean
struck
lettie
as
almost
deliberately
and
as
if
after
their
father
death
candace
and
marcus
had
wanted
to
that
for
them
stone
cottage
could
never
be
home
upstairs
candace
with
lettie
following
moved
with
through
the
three
bedrooms
giving
glance
inside
the
cupboards
and
then
almost
slamming
them
shut
as
if
the
search
were
tedious
routine
there
was
fleeting
but
of
country
smell
of
old
clothes
and
in
candace
wardrobe
lettie
glimpsed
the
scarlet
of
doctor
gown
the
front
room
had
been
her
father
here
everything
had
been
cleared
away
apart
from
the
narrow
bed
to
the
right
of
the
window
this
had
been
stripped
bare
except
for
single
sheet
stretched
taut
and
pristine
over
the
mattress
the
domestic
of
the
of
death
neither
spoke
the
search
was
nearly
over
they
went
downstairs
their
feet
loud
on
the
uncarpeted
staircase
the
sitting
room
had
no
cupboards
and
they
passed
again
into
the
old
candace
suddenly
for
the
first
time
what
lettie
had
been
feeling
throughout
said
what
on
earth
do
we
think
we
re
doing
we
re
acting
as
if
searching
for
child
or
lost
animal
let
the
police
take
over
if
they
re
worried
lettie
said
but
we
re
nearly
through
and
at
least
we
ve
been
he
not
anywhere
in
either
cottage
or
in
the
candace
had
moved
into
the
large
walk
in
her
voice
was
muffled
it
time
cleared
out
this
place
while
father
was
ill
became
about
making
god
knows
why
he
liked
home
made
but
not
that
much
forgotten
the
were
still
here
ll
get
dean
to
collect
them
he
ll
find
use
for
them
if
he
to
take
them
my
is
hardly
up
to
his
standard
she
reappeared
lettie
turning
to
follow
her
to
the
door
paused
then
and
lifted
the
lid
of
the
freezer
the
action
was
instinctive
and
without
thought
time
stopped
for
couple
of
seconds
which
in
would
stretch
to
minutes
she
stared
down
at
what
lay
below
the
lid
fell
out
of
her
hands
with
soft
and
she
slumped
over
the
freezer
shaking
uncontrollably
her
heart
was
pounding
and
something
had
happened
to
her
voice
she
gasped
and
tried
to
form
words
but
no
sound
came
at
last
struggling
she
found
voice
it
didn
sound
like
her
voice
or
anyone
she
knew
she
croaked
candace
don
look
don
look
don
come
but
candace
was
pushing
her
aside
forcing
the
lid
wide
open
against
the
weight
of
lettie
body
he
was
lying
curled
on
his
back
both
legs
raised
in
the
air
his
feet
must
have
been
pressed
against
the
lid
of
the
freezer
his
two
hands
like
lay
pale
and
delicate
the
hands
of
child
in
his
desperation
he
had
beaten
his
hands
against
the
lid
his
knuckles
were
and
there
were
of
dried
blood
on
his
fingers
his
face
was
mask
of
terror
the
blue
eyes
wide
and
as
the
lips
drawn
back
he
must
have
his
tongue
in
the
final
and
two
of
blood
had
dried
on
his
chin
he
was
wearing
blue
jeans
and
blue
and
checked
open
necked
shirt
the
smell
familiar
and
rose
up
like
gas
somehow
lettie
found
the
strength
to
to
one
of
the
kitchen
chairs
and
collapsed
into
it
and
now
no
longer
standing
her
strength
began
to
return
and
her
became
more
regular
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
lid
being
closed
but
quietly
almost
gently
as
if
candace
were
afraid
of
waking
the
dead
she
looked
across
candace
was
standing
motionless
against
the
freezer
then
suddenly
she
began
and
running
to
the
stone
sink
was
violently
sick
clutching
the
sink
sides
for
support
the
continued
long
after
there
was
nothing
to
bring
up
loud
which
must
have
her
throat
lettie
watched
wanting
to
help
but
knowing
candace
wouldn
want
to
be
touched
now
candace
turned
the
to
full
power
and
was
water
over
her
face
as
if
the
skin
were
on
fire
of
water
ran
down
over
her
jacket
and
her
hair
lay
in
sodden
against
her
cheeks
without
speaking
she
stretched
out
hand
and
found
tea
hanging
by
the
sink
on
then
it
out
under
the
still
flowing
and
began
again
to
wash
her
face
at
last
lettie
felt
able
to
get
to
her
feet
and
placing
an
arm
round
candace
waist
led
her
to
the
second
chair
candace
said
sorry
it
the
stink
never
could
stand
that
particular
smell
with
the
horror
of
that
lonely
death
still
on
her
mind
lettie
felt
sharp
pity
it
isn
the
smell
of
death
candace
he
couldn
help
it
he
had
an
accident
perhaps
out
of
terror
it
happens
she
thought
but
didn
say
and
that
must
mean
that
he
went
into
the
freezer
alive
or
does
it
the
forensic
pathologist
will
know
now
that
her
physical
strength
had
returned
her
mind
felt
clear
she
said
we
must
ring
the
police
commander
dalgliesh
gave
us
number
do
you
remember
it
candace
shook
her
head
nor
do
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
we
need
it
he
and
that
other
policeman
were
always
about
the
place
ll
fetch
him
but
now
candace
her
head
stretched
back
her
face
so
white
that
it
looked
as
if
of
all
emotion
all
that
made
her
herself
no
more
than
mask
of
flesh
and
bone
said
no
don
go
all
right
but
think
we
ought
to
stay
together
my
mobile
in
my
pocket
use
it
to
get
someone
at
the
manor
try
the
office
first
and
then
george
tell
him
to
call
dalgliesh
he
mustn
come
himself
none
of
them
should
couldn
stand
crowd
questions
curiosity
pity
we
ll
get
all
that
but
not
now
lettie
was
ringing
the
office
there
was
no
reply
and
she
tried
george
number
listening
and
waiting
for
response
she
said
he
shouldn
come
here
anyway
he
ll
know
that
the
cottage
will
be
crime
scene
candace
voice
was
sharp
what
crime
there
was
still
no
reply
from
george
phone
lettie
said
it
could
be
suicide
isn
suicide
crime
does
it
look
like
suicide
does
it
does
it
lettie
appalled
thought
what
are
we
about
but
she
said
calmly
you
re
right
we
know
nothing
but
commander
dalgliesh
won
want
crowd
we
ll
stay
here
and
wait
and
now
at
last
the
mobile
was
answered
and
lettie
heard
george
voice
she
said
from
stone
cottage
candace

here
with
me

george

now
just

dalgliesh
yes
we
re
all
right
shocked
but
all
right
ll
get
dalgliesh
and
the
call
was
ended
neither
of
them
spoke
in
the
silence
lettie
was
aware
only
of
their
deeply
drawn
breath
they
sat
on
the
two
kitchen
chairs
not
speaking
time
passed
endless
time
then
there
were
faces
passing
the
opposite
window
the
police
had
arrived
lettie
had
expected
them
to
walk
in
but
there
was
knock
on
the
door
and
glancing
at
candace
rigid
face
she
went
to
open
it
commander
dalgliesh
came
in
followed
by
inspector
miskin
and
sergeant
benton
smith
to
her
surprise
dalgliesh
didn
immediately
go
to
the
freezer
but
concerned
himself
with
the
two
women
taking
two
mugs
from
the
he
filled
them
at
the
and
brought
them
over
candace
left
her
mug
on
the
table
but
lettie
found
herself
desperate
for
water
and
drained
hers
she
was
aware
of
commander
dalgliesh
watching
them
closely
he
said
need
to
ask
some
questions
you
ve
both
had
terrible
shock
are
you
well
enough
to
talk
him
steadily
candace
said
yes
perfectly
thank
you
lettie
murmured
her
consent
then
perhaps
we
had
better
go
next
door
ll
be
with
you
in
minute
inspector
miskin
followed
them
into
the
sitting
room
lettie
thought
so
he
not
going
to
leave
us
alone
until
he
heard
our
story
then
wondered
if
she
was
being
or
suspicious
if
candace
and
she
had
wanted
to
an
agreed
account
of
their
actions
there
had
been
time
enough
before
the
police
arrived
they
seated
themselves
on
the
oak
settle
and
inspector
miskin
drew
up
two
chairs
from
the
table
to
face
them
without
sitting
she
said
can
get
you
anything
tea
coffee
if
miss
westhall
will
tell
me
where
to
find
things
candace
voice
was
nothing
thank
you
all
want
is
to
get
out
of
here
commander
dalgliesh
won
be
long
nor
was
he
hardly
had
she
spoken
than
he
appeared
and
took
one
of
the
chairs
directly
opposite
them
inspector
miskin
took
the
other
dalgliesh
face
only
feet
from
theirs
was
as
pale
as
candace
but
it
was
impossible
to
guess
what
was
going
on
behind
that
carved
mask
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
gentle
almost
sympathetic
but
lettie
had
no
doubt
that
the
ideas
his
mind
was
had
little
to
do
with
he
asked
how
did
you
both
come
to
be
in
stone
cottage
this
morning
it
was
candace
who
replied
we
were
looking
for
robin
his
business
partner
rang
the
office
at
about
nine
forty
to
say
that
he
hadn
been
able
to
contact
robin
since
yesterday
morning
and
was
worried
mrs
frensham
came
over
first
and
found
the
remains
of
meal
on
the
kitchen
table
his
car
in
the
and
his
bed
apparently
not
slept
in
so
we
came
back
to
make
more
search
did
either
of
you
know
or
suspect
that
you
would
find
robin
boyton
in
the
freezer
he
made
no
for
the
question
which
was
almost
lettie
hoped
that
candace
would
keep
her
temper
she
herself
to
quiet
no
and
looking
into
dalgliesh
eyes
thought
that
she
had
been
believed
candace
was
silent
for
moment
while
dalgliesh
waited
obviously
not
or
we
would
have
looked
into
the
freezer
immediately
we
were
looking
for
living
man
not
dead
body
personally
thought
that
robin
would
turn
up
soon
enough
but
his
absence
was
since
he
isn
given
to
country
and
suppose
we
were
looking
for
to
explain
where
he
might
have
gone
which
of
you
opened
the
freezer
lettie
said
did
the
old
the
room
next
door
was
the
last
place
we
searched
candace
had
gone
into
the
walk
in
and
lifted
the
freezer
lid
on
impulse
almost
without
thinking
we
looked
in
all
the
cupboards
in
rose
cottage
and
in
here
and
in
the
garden
and
suppose
looking
in
the
freezer
seemed
natural
action
dalgliesh
didn
speak
lettie
thought
is
he
going
to
point
out
that
search
which
included
cupboards
and
freezer
was
hardly
search
for
living
man
but
she
had
given
her
explanation
she
wasn
sure
that
it
sounded
even
to
her
own
ears
but
it
was
the
truth
and
she
had
nothing
to
add
it
was
candace
who
attempted
to
explain
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
robin
might
be
dead
and
neither
of
us
ever
mentioned
that
possibility
took
the
and
once
we
begun
to
in
cupboards
and
were
making
search
suppose
as
lettie
has
said
it
seemed
natural
to
carry
on
may
have
had
the
possibility
of
an
accident
at
the
back
of
my
mind
but
the
word
wasn
mentioned
between
us
dalgliesh
and
inspector
miskin
got
to
their
feet
dalgliesh
said
thank
you
both
you
need
to
get
out
of
here
won
trouble
you
any
further
for
now
he
turned
to
candace
afraid
for
the
present
and
probably
for
some
days
stone
cottage
will
have
to
be
closed
candace
said
as
crime
scene
as
scene
of
an
death
mr
chandler
powell
me
that
there
are
rooms
for
you
and
your
brother
at
the
manor
sorry
for
the
inconvenience
but
sure
you
ll
understand
the
necessity
there
will
also
be
forensic
pathologist
and
officers
coming
here
but
care
will
be
taken
not
to
cause
damage
candace
said
you
can
pull
the
place
apart
for
all
care
ve
finished
with
it
he
went
on
as
if
he
hadn
heard
inspector
miskin
will
go
with
you
to
collect
what
you
need
to
take
to
the
manor
lettie
thought
so
they
were
under
what
did
he
fear
that
they
might
make
run
for
it
but
she
told
herself
that
she
was
being
he
had
been
polite
and
so
but
then
what
did
he
gain
by
being
otherwise
candace
got
to
her
feet
can
collect
what
need
my
brother
can
pack
for
himself
no
doubt
under
ve
no
intention
of
rummaging
through
his
room
dalgliesh
said
calmly
ll
let
you
know
when
it
will
be
possible
for
him
to
collect
what
he
needs
inspector
miskin
will
help
you
now
the
three
of
them
led
by
candace
climbed
the
stairs
lettie
glad
of
an
excuse
for
getting
away
from
the
old
in
her
bedroom
candace
dragged
suitcase
from
the
wardrobe
but
it
was
inspector
miskin
who
lifted
it
onto
the
bed
candace
began
taking
clothes
from
her
drawers
and
wardrobe
folding
them
quickly
and
them
into
the
case
warm
trousers
shirts
and
shoes
she
went
into
the
bathroom
and
returned
with
her
toilet
bag
without
glance
they
were
ready
to
go
commander
dalgliesh
and
sergeant
benton
smith
were
in
the
old
obviously
waiting
for
them
to
leave
the
lid
of
the
freezer
was
closed
candace
handed
over
the
house
keys
sergeant
benton
smith
and
the
cottage
door
was
closed
behind
them
lettie
listening
thought
she
heard
the
turning
of
the
key
silently
with
inspector
miskin
walking
between
them
they
took
deep
of
the
sweet
damp
morning
air
and
in
silence
made
their
slow
way
back
to
the
manor
as
they
approached
the
front
door
of
the
manor
inspector
miskin
stood
back
and
turned
away
as
if
anxious
to
that
they
hadn
returned
under
police
it
gave
candace
time
for
quick
whisper
as
lettie
opened
the
door
don
discuss
what
happened
just
give
them
the
facts
lettie
was
tempted
to
say
that
she
had
no
intention
of
doing
more
but
had
time
only
to
murmur
of
course
she
noticed
that
candace
immediately
put
herself
out
of
risk
of
discussing
anything
by
saying
that
she
wanted
to
see
where
she
would
be
sleeping
helena
came
forward
at
once
and
the
two
of
them
disappeared
into
the
east
wing
which
with
flavia
already
sleeping
there
since
the
patients
corridor
was
was
likely
soon
to
become
crowded
marcus
after
for
dalgliesh
consent
went
to
stone
cottage
to
collect
the
clothes
and
books
he
needed
then
joined
his
sister
in
the
east
wing
everyone
was
quietly
no
questions
were
asked
but
as
the
morning
dragged
on
the
air
seemed
to
be
with
comments
chief
among
them
why
exactly
had
lettie
lifted
the
freezer
lid
since
in
the
end
someone
would
surely
voice
it
lettie
increasingly
felt
that
she
should
break
her
silence
despite
what
she
and
candace
had
agreed
as
one
clock
approached
there
was
still
no
news
from
commander
dalgliesh
or
his
team
only
four
of
the
household
sat
down
in
the
dining
room
for
lunch
mr
chandler
powell
helena
flavia
and
lettie
candace
had
asked
that
tray
for
herself
and
marcus
should
be
sent
up
to
her
room
on
operating
days
chandler
powell
ate
lunch
later
with
his
team
if
he
ate
formal
meal
at
all
but
at
other
times
as
today
he
joined
the
party
in
the
dining
room
lettie
sometimes
felt
that
the
small
household
should
eat
together
but
dean
she
knew
would
have
considered
it
to
his
status
as
to
be
expected
to
lunch
or
with
those
he
served
he
and
kim
with
sharon
ate
later
in
their
own
apartment
the
meal
was
simple
first
course
of
followed
by
and
baked
potatoes
and
winter
when
flavia
helping
herself
to
asked
whether
anyone
knew
when
they
could
expect
the
police
to
appear
lettie
broke
in
with
what
seemed
to
her
an
unnatural
they
didn
say
when
we
were
at
stone
cottage
expect
they
re
busy
the
freezer
perhaps
they
ll
take
it
away
can
explain
why
lifted
the
lid
we
were
on
our
way
out
and
it
was
an
gesture
perhaps
no
more
than
curiosity
flavia
said
it
just
as
well
you
did
he
could
have
been
there
for
days
while
the
police
were
searching
the
after
all
unless
they
suspected
they
were
looking
for
body
why
would
they
open
the
freezer
why
would
anybody
mr
chandler
powell
but
didn
comment
there
was
silence
broken
by
the
entrance
of
sharon
to
remove
the
soup
period
of
had
proved
boring
and
she
had
to
limited
number
of
household
at
the
door
she
turned
and
said
with
for
her
unexpected
perhaps
there
murderer
loose
in
the
village
picking
us
all
off
one
by
one
read
book
by
which
with
that
they
were
all
cut
off
on
this
island
and
the
killer
was
among
them
in
the
end
only
one
was
left
alive
flavia
voice
was
sharp
don
be
ridiculous
sharon
miss
gradwyn
death
did
that
look
like
the
work
of
murderer
they
kill
to
pattern
and
why
should
mass
murderer
put
body
in
freezer
but
perhaps
your
killer
has
an
obsession
with
and
is
even
now
looking
for
one
to
his
next
victim
sharon
opened
her
mouth
to
caught
glance
from
chandler
powell
and
thought
better
of
it
then
kicked
the
door
closed
after
her
no
one
spoke
lettie
sensed
the
general
feeling
that
if
sharon
comment
had
been
ill
judged
flavia
hadn
on
it
murder
was
crime
subtly
changing
which
even
if
not
close
had
been
easy
and
without
strain
hers
with
candace
and
now
with
flavia
it
wasn
question
of
suspicion
more
the
spread
of
an
atmosphere
of
unease
growing
awareness
that
other
people
other
minds
were
but
she
felt
concern
for
flavia
with
her
sitting
room
in
the
west
wing
to
her
she
had
taken
to
walking
alone
in
the
garden
or
down
the
lime
walk
to
the
stones
returning
with
eyes
more
red
and
swollen
than
could
be
caused
by
keen
wind
or
sudden
shower
perhaps
thought
lettie
it
wasn
surprising
that
flavia
seemed
more
affected
by
miss
gradwyn
death
than
were
the
others
she
and
chandler
powell
had
lost
patient
for
both
of
them
it
was
professional
disaster
and
then
there
were
the
about
the
relationship
with
george
when
they
were
together
at
the
manor
it
was
always
one
of
surgeon
and
theatre
sister
sometimes
seeming
almost
unnecessarily
professional
certainly
if
they
had
been
sleeping
together
at
the
manor
someone
would
have
known
but
lettie
wondered
if
flavia
changing
the
new
the
had
cause
other
than
the
death
of
patient
as
the
day
wore
on
it
became
apparent
to
lettie
that
this
death
was
more
interest
than
either
fear
or
anxiety
robin
boyton
was
hardly
known
except
to
his
cousins
and
not
particularly
liked
by
those
who
did
know
him
and
at
least
he
had
had
the
to
die
outside
the
manor
none
would
have
expressed
the
thought
with
such
but
the
hundred
yards
or
so
between
the
house
and
stone
cottage
was
as
well
as
physical
from
corpse
imagined
but
by
the
not
they
felt
more
like
than
in
drama
from
the
action
beginning
indeed
to
feel
by
dalgliesh
and
his
team
who
asked
for
information
and
gave
so
little
in
return
mog
who
by
of
his
job
in
the
garden
and
throughout
the
grounds
had
an
excuse
to
at
the
gate
had
fed
them
of
information
he
reported
on
the
return
of
the
scene
of
crime
officers
the
arrival
of
the
photographer
and
dr
glenister
and
finally
the
body
bag
being
down
the
cottage
path
to
the
mortuary
van
with
that
news
the
company
at
the
manor
themselves
for
the
return
of
dalgliesh
and
his
team
dalgliesh
who
was
occupied
at
stone
cottage
left
the
questioning
to
kate
and
benton
it
was
three
thirty
before
they
arrived
to
begin
their
enquiries
and
again
with
the
consent
of
mr
chandler
powell
used
the
library
for
the
of
their
interviews
for
the
first
few
hours
the
were
dr
glenister
couldn
be
expected
to
give
precise
assessment
of
the
time
of
death
until
after
the
post
mortem
but
given
the
of
her
preliminary
they
could
work
on
the
that
boyton
had
died
the
previous
day
between
two
clock
and
six
the
fact
that
he
hadn
had
time
to
wash
his
plates
after
meal
that
was
clearly
more
likely
to
be
lunch
than
breakfast
was
less
helpful
than
it
seemed
since
there
were
in
the
sink
and
two
which
looked
as
if
they
had
been
there
from
the
night
before
kate
decided
to
ask
people
where
they
were
the
previous
day
from
one
clock
until
dinner
which
was
served
at
eight
nearly
everyone
could
provide
an
alibi
for
part
of
the
time
but
none
for
the
whole
seven
hours
the
afternoon
was
time
when
people
were
generally
free
to
follow
their
own
or
and
most
had
been
alone
for
some
of
the
time
either
in
the
manor
or
in
the
garden
marcus
westhall
had
driven
into
bournemouth
to
do
some
christmas
shopping
leaving
shortly
after
lunch
and
had
not
returned
until
seven
thirty
kate
sensed
that
the
rest
of
the
household
thought
that
it
was
little
odd
that
whenever
there
was
dead
body
to
be
explained
marcus
westhall
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
absent
his
sister
had
worked
with
lettie
in
the
office
in
the
morning
and
after
lunch
had
returned
to
stone
cottage
to
garden
she
had
been
sweeping
leaves
building
up
the
and
cutting
away
the
dead
of
the
bushes
until
the
light
began
to
fail
she
had
then
returned
to
the
cottage
to
make
tea
entering
by
the
door
into
the
which
she
had
left
open
she
had
seen
boyton
car
parked
outside
but
had
seen
and
heard
nothing
of
him
the
whole
afternoon
george
chandler
powell
flavia
and
helena
had
occupied
themselves
in
the
manor
either
in
their
own
or
in
the
office
but
were
only
able
to
provide
firm
for
the
time
when
with
the
others
they
were
eating
lunch
having
afternoon
tea
in
the
library
and
dinner
at
eight
clock
kate
sensed
their
resentment
shared
by
the
others
at
having
to
be
so
specific
about
time
it
had
after
all
been
for
them
an
ordinary
day
mog
claimed
that
he
had
been
busy
for
most
of
the
previous
afternoon
in
the
rose
garden
and
in
the
large
in
the
formal
gardens
no
one
remembered
seeing
him
but
he
was
able
to
with
few
waiting
to
be
planted
and
the
which
had
contained
the
others
neither
kate
nor
benton
felt
inclined
to
him
by
into
the
to
see
if
the
were
there
but
no
doubt
this
could
be
done
if
it
proved
sharon
had
been
persuaded
to
spend
some
time
in
the
afternoon
and
furniture
and
cleaning
the
in
the
great
hall
entrance
hall
and
library
certainly
the
noise
of
the
had
from
time
to
time
been
an
to
others
in
the
manor
but
no
one
could
be
specific
when
exactly
it
was
heard
benton
pointed
out
that
it
was
possible
for
to
be
left
on
without
anyone
using
it
suggestion
which
kate
found
difficult
to
take
seriously
sharon
had
also
spent
time
in
the
kitchen
helping
dean
and
kimberley
she
gave
her
evidence
enough
but
took
an
time
before
answering
questions
and
stared
throughout
at
kate
with
interest
and
hint
of
pity
which
kate
found
more
disconcerting
than
the
expected
altogether
by
late
afternoon
they
felt
that
little
had
so
far
been
achieved
it
was
perfectly
possible
for
any
of
the
of
the
manor
including
marcus
on
his
way
to
bournemouth
to
have
called
at
stone
cottage
but
how
could
anyone
other
than
westhall
have
robin
into
the
cottage
managed
to
kill
him
and
returned
to
the
manor
avoiding
the
security
obviously
the
prime
suspect
had
to
be
candace
westhall
who
certainly
had
the
strength
to
shove
boyton
into
the
freezer
but
it
was
premature
to
decide
on
prime
suspect
when
at
present
they
had
no
evidence
that
the
death
had
been
murder
it
was
nearly
five
clock
before
they
got
round
to
seeing
the
bostocks
the
interview
took
place
in
the
kitchen
where
kate
and
benton
were
comfortably
in
low
chairs
beside
the
window
while
the
bostocks
drew
up
couple
of
upright
chairs
from
the
table
before
themselves
they
made
tea
for
the
four
of
them
and
set
up
with
some
low
table
in
front
of
the
visitors
them
to
kim
biscuits
newly
baked
and
hot
from
the
an
smell
rich
and
from
the
open
door
the
biscuits
almost
too
hot
to
handle
thin
and
were
delicious
kim
with
the
face
of
happy
child
smiled
on
them
as
they
ate
and
pressed
them
not
to
hold
back
there
were
plenty
more
dean
poured
the
tea
the
atmosphere
became
domestic
almost
outside
the
rain
air
pressed
against
the
windows
like
and
the
darkness
obscured
all
but
the
of
the
knot
garden
while
the
high
hedge
became
distant
inside
all
was
light
colour
and
warmth
and
the
of
tea
and
food
the
bostocks
were
able
to
provide
an
alibi
for
each
other
having
spent
almost
all
the
previous
twenty
four
hours
together
mostly
in
the
kitchen
or
when
taking
advantage
of
mog
temporary
absence
they
had
together
visited
the
kitchen
garden
to
vegetables
for
dinner
mog
tended
to
every
gap
in
his
carefully
planted
rows
kim
on
her
return
had
served
the
main
meals
and
later
cleared
the
table
but
usually
there
had
been
someone
present
miss
cressett
or
mrs
frensham
both
bostocks
looked
shocked
but
less
or
frightened
than
kate
and
benton
had
expected
partly
kate
thought
because
boyton
had
been
only
an
occasional
visitor
for
whom
they
had
no
responsibility
and
whose
rare
so
far
from
adding
to
the
of
the
community
were
regarded
particularly
by
dean
as
source
of
irritation
and
extra
work
boyton
had
made
his
mark
young
man
with
his
looks
could
hardly
fail
but
kimberley
happily
in
love
with
her
husband
was
to
and
dean
was
largely
concerned
to
guard
his
kitchen
against
neither
seemed
particularly
frightened
perhaps
because
it
became
apparent
that
they
had
managed
to
themselves
that
boyton
death
had
been
an
accident
conscious
of
their
own
interested
little
excited
and
they
on
and
kate
let
the
talk
flow
the
bostocks
like
the
rest
of
the
household
had
been
told
only
that
boyton
body
had
been
found
and
where
what
else
at
present
was
there
to
tell
and
there
had
been
no
point
in
leaving
anyone
in
it
might
with
luck
be
possible
to
keep
this
present
death
out
of
the
press
and
for
while
from
the
village
if
mog
held
his
tongue
but
it
was
hardly
or
necessary
to
keep
it
from
anyone
at
the
manor
it
was
nearly
six
clock
when
the
came
kim
roused
herself
from
minute
silent
and
said
poor
man
he
must
have
climbed
into
the
freezer
and
then
the
lid
fell
down
on
him
why
would
he
do
that
perhaps
he
was
playing
silly
game
sort
of
private
dare
like
kids
do
my
mum
had
big
at
home
more
like
trunk
really
and
we
kids
used
to
hide
in
it
but
why
didn
he
push
up
the
lid
dean
was
already
clearing
the
table
he
said
he
couldn
not
if
the
catch
fell
down
but
he
not
kid
thing
to
do
not
nice
way
to
go
or
maybe
he
had
heart
attack
looking
at
kim
face
in
distress
he
added
firmly
that
probably
what
it
was
heart
attack
he
got
into
the
freezer
out
of
curiosity
when
he
couldn
open
the
lid
and
died
nice
and
quick
he
wouldn
have
felt
thing
kate
said
that
possible
we
ll
know
more
after
the
had
he
ever
complained
to
you
about
his
heart
said
he
had
to
be
careful
anything
like
that
dean
looked
at
kim
who
shook
her
head
not
to
us
well
he
wouldn
would
he
he
wasn
here
often
and
we
didn
usually
see
him
the
westhalls
may
know
they
re
cousins
and
his
story
was
that
he
came
here
to
see
them
mrs
frensham
makes
him
pay
something
but
mog
says
he
doesn
think
it
the
full
visitors
rent
he
says
mr
boyton
was
just
after
cheap
holiday
kim
said
don
think
miss
candace
would
know
anything
about
his
health
mr
marcus
might
being
doctor
but
don
think
they
were
close
ve
heard
miss
candace
say
to
mrs
frensham
that
robin
boyton
never
bothered
to
tell
them
when
he
was
the
cottage
and
if
you
ask
me
they
weren
all
that
pleased
to
see
him
mog
says
that
there
was
some
kind
of
family
but
he
doesn
know
what
about
kate
said
this
time
of
course
mr
boyton
said
he
was
here
to
see
miss
gradwyn
but
he
didn
see
her
did
he
not
this
time
or
when
she
was
here
couple
of
weeks
ago
mr
chandler
powell
and
sister
holland
saw
to
that
don
believe
they
were
friends
mr
boyton
and
miss
gradwyn
that
was
probably
him
trying
to
make
himself
look
important
but
it
odd
about
the
freezer
it
isn
even
in
his
cottage
but
he
seemed
sort
of
fascinated
with
it
do
you
remember
dean
all
those
questions
he
asked
when
he
was
last
here
and
came
to
some
he
never
paid
it
back
her
interest
and
taking
care
to
avoid
benton
eyes
kate
said
when
was
that
dean
glanced
at
his
wife
the
night
miss
gradwyn
first
arrived
tuesday
the
twenty
seventh
wasn
it
guests
are
expected
to
bring
their
own
food
and
then
they
either
shop
or
eat
out
always
leave
milk
in
the
fridge
and
tea
coffee
and
sugar
but
that
all
unless
they
order
in
advance
and
then
mog
shops
for
them
mr
boyton
rang
to
say
that
he
had
forgotten
to
bring
and
could
let
him
have
packet
he
said
he
come
over
for
it
but
wasn
keen
to
have
him
about
the
kitchen
so
said
take
it
it
was
six
thirty
and
the
cottage
looked
as
if
he
just
arrived
his
was
dumped
on
the
kitchen
floor
he
asked
if
miss
gradwyn
had
arrived
and
when
could
he
see
her
but
said
couldn
discuss
anything
to
do
with
patient
and
he
better
speak
to
sister
or
mr
chandler
powell
and
then
casual
like
he
began
asking
about
the
freezer
how
long
had
it
been
next
door
was
it
still
working
did
miss
westhall
use
it
told
him
that
it
was
old
and
useless
and
no
one
used
it
said
miss
westhall
had
asked
mog
to
get
rid
of
it
but
he
said
it
wasn
his
job
it
was
for
the
council
to
take
it
away
and
miss
cressett
or
miss
westhall
had
better
ring
them
don
think
anyone
did
then
he
stopped
asking
questions
he
offered
me
beer
but
didn
want
to
drink
with
him
haven
the
time
anyway
so
left
and
came
back
to
the
manor
kate
said
but
the
freezer
was
next
door
in
stone
cottage
how
did
he
know
about
it
it
must
have
been
dark
by
the
time
he
arrived
suppose
he
seen
it
on
previous
visit
he
must
have
been
in
stone
cottage
at
some
time
at
least
after
the
old
man
died
he
used
to
make
lot
of
the
westhalls
being
cousins
or
he
could
have
round
when
miss
westhall
wasn
there
people
round
here
don
bother
much
about
their
doors
kim
said
and
there
door
from
the
old
through
the
to
to
the
garden
that
could
have
been
open
or
he
could
have
seen
the
freezer
from
the
window
funny
though
him
taking
an
interest
like
that
it
only
an
old
freezer
it
isn
even
working
it
broke
in
you
remember
dean
you
wanted
to
use
it
to
store
that
of
over
the
bank
holiday
and
you
found
it
wasn
working
at
last
something
had
been
achieved
benton
glanced
quickly
at
kate
her
face
was
but
he
knew
that
their
thoughts
marched
in
step
she
asked
when
was
it
last
used
as
freezer
dean
said
can
remember
no
one
ever
reported
that
it
wasn
working
we
didn
need
it
except
for
bank
holidays
and
when
mr
chandler
powell
had
guests
when
it
could
come
in
useful
if
stone
cottage
was
empty
the
freezer
here
is
usually
plenty
big
enough
kate
and
benton
were
rising
to
go
kate
said
have
you
told
anyone
here
about
mr
boyton
interest
in
the
freezer
the
bostocks
looked
at
each
other
then
vigorously
shook
their
heads
then
please
keep
this
to
don
discuss
the
freezer
with
anyone
at
the
manor
kimberley
wide
eyed
asked
is
it
important
probably
not
but
we
don
yet
know
what
is
or
could
be
important
that
why
want
you
to
say
nothing
kim
said
we
won
cross
my
heart
and
hope
to
die
anyway
mr
chandler
powell
doesn
like
us
to
gossip
and
we
never
do
kate
and
benton
had
hardly
got
to
their
feet
and
were
dean
and
kimberley
for
the
tea
and
biscuits
when
kate
mobile
rang
she
listened
acknowledged
the
call
and
said
nothing
until
they
were
outside
then
she
said
that
was
ad
we
re
to
go
at
once
to
the
old
police
cottage
candace
westhall
wants
to
make
statement
she
ll
be
there
in
fifteen
minutes
it
looks
as
if
we
may
be
getting
somewhere
at
last
they
reached
the
old
police
cottage
just
before
candace
left
the
gates
of
the
manor
and
from
the
window
kate
could
see
her
figure
pausing
to
look
both
ways
at
the
edge
of
the
road
then
walking
across
the
strong
shoulders
swinging
dalgliesh
greeted
her
at
the
door
and
led
her
to
seat
at
the
table
and
with
kate
sat
opposite
benton
took
the
fourth
chair
and
notebook
in
hand
himself
to
the
right
of
the
door
in
her
country
and
candace
he
thought
had
the
assurance
of
vicar
wife
visiting
but
from
his
seat
he
could
glimpse
the
only
sign
of
momentary
of
the
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
whatever
she
had
come
to
tell
them
she
had
taken
her
time
over
it
but
he
had
no
doubt
that
she
knew
precisely
what
she
was
prepared
to
say
and
how
she
would
it
without
waiting
for
dalgliesh
to
speak
she
began
her
story
have
an
explanation
for
what
could
have
happened
what
seems
to
me
possible
even
it
doesn
well
on
me
but
think
you
should
know
of
it
even
if
you
decide
to
it
as
fantasy
robin
could
have
been
with
or
some
ludicrous
joke
and
it
went
wrong
need
to
explain
but
it
will
family
affairs
which
can
in
themselves
be
relevant
to
rhoda
gradwyn
murder
take
it
that
what
tell
you
will
be
treated
as
confidential
if
you
re
satisfied
that
it
has
no
direct
bearing
on
her
death
dalgliesh
words
were
statement
not
warning
but
they
were
direct
it
will
be
for
me
to
decide
what
is
relevant
and
how
far
family
secrets
can
be
protected
can
give
any
in
advance
you
must
know
that
so
in
this
as
in
other
matters
we
have
to
trust
the
police
forgive
me
but
that
doesn
come
easily
in
an
age
when
information
is
money
dalgliesh
said
quietly
my
officers
do
not
sell
information
to
newspapers
miss
westhall
aren
we
time
you
have
responsibility
to
assist
my
investigation
by
any
information
you
have
which
could
be
relevant
we
have
no
wish
to
cause
unnecessary
distress
and
have
enough
problems
in
relevant
information
without
time
on
matters
that
are
not
relevant
if
you
know
how
robin
boyton
body
got
into
the
freezer
or
have
any
information
which
could
help
to
answer
that
question
hadn
we
better
get
on
with
it
if
the
her
she
betrayed
no
sign
of
it
she
said
some
of
it
may
already
be
known
to
you
if
robin
has
spoken
to
you
about
his
relationship
with
the
family
as
dalgliesh
didn
reply
she
went
on
he
is
as
he
fond
of
marcus
and
my
first
cousin
his
mother
was
our
father
only
sister
for
at
least
the
past
two
generations
the
westhall
men
have
and
occasionally
despised
their
daughters
the
birth
of
son
was
cause
for
celebration
the
birth
of
daughter
this
isn
totally
even
today
but
with
my
father
and
grandfather
it
amounted
almost
to
family
obsession
not
saying
there
was
any
physical
or
cruelty
there
wasn
but
ve
no
doubt
robin
mother
suffered
emotional
and
acquired
weight
of
and
self
she
wasn
clever
or
pretty
or
indeed
particularly
and
was
not
something
of
problem
from
childhood
she
left
home
as
soon
as
she
could
and
had
some
satisfaction
in
her
parents
by
living
fairly
life
in
the
world
on
the
of
the
music
scene
she
was
just
twenty
one
when
she
married
keith
boyton
and
she
could
hardly
have
made
worse
choice
only
met
him
once
but
found
him
she
was
pregnant
when
they
married
but
that
was
hardly
an
excuse
and
surprised
she
went
ahead
with
the
pregnancy
was
new
sensation
suppose
keith
had
certain
but
have
never
met
anyone
more
obviously
on
the
make
he
was
