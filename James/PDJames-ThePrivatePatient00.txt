on
november
the
the
day
of
her
forty
seventh
birthday
and
three
weeks
and
two
days
before
she
was
murdered
rhoda
gradwyn
went
to
street
to
keep
first
appointment
with
her
plastic
surgeon
and
there
in
consulting
room
designed
so
it
appeared
to
confidence
and
apprehension
made
the
decision
which
would
lead
to
her
death
later
that
day
she
was
to
lunch
at
the
the
of
the
two
appointments
was
mr
chandler
powell
had
no
earlier
date
to
offer
and
the
later
with
robin
boyton
booked
for
twelve
forty
five
had
been
arranged
two
months
previously
one
did
not
expect
to
get
table
at
the
on
impulse
she
regarded
neither
appointment
as
birthday
celebration
this
detail
of
her
private
life
like
much
else
was
never
mentioned
she
doubted
whether
robin
had
discovered
her
date
of
birth
or
would
much
care
if
he
had
she
knew
herself
to
be
respected
even
distinguished
journalist
but
she
hardly
expected
her
name
to
appear
in
the
times
list
of
she
was
due
at
street
at
eleven
fifteen
usually
with
london
appointment
she
preferred
to
walk
at
least
part
of
the
way
but
today
she
had
ordered
for
ten
thirty
the
journey
from
the
city
shouldn
take
three
of
an
hour
but
the
london
traffic
was
she
was
entering
world
that
was
strange
to
her
and
had
no
wish
to
her
relationship
with
her
surgeon
by
arriving
late
for
this
their
first
meeting
eight
years
ago
she
had
taken
lease
on
house
in
the
city
part
of
narrow
in
small
at
the
end
of
near
and
knew
as
soon
as
she
moved
in
that
this
was
the
part
of
london
in
which
she
would
always
choose
to
live
the
lease
was
long
and
she
would
have
liked
to
buy
the
house
but
knew
that
it
would
never
be
for
sale
but
the
fact
that
she
couldn
hope
to
call
it
entirely
her
own
didn
distress
her
most
of
it
dated
back
to
the
century
many
generations
had
lived
in
it
been
born
and
died
there
leaving
behind
nothing
but
their
names
on
and
and
she
was
content
to
be
in
their
company
although
the
lower
rooms
with
their
windows
were
dark
those
in
her
study
and
sitting
room
on
the
top
were
open
to
the
sky
giving
view
of
the
and
of
the
city
and
beyond
an
iron
staircase
led
from
narrow
on
the
third
floor
to
roof
which
held
row
of
and
where
on
fine
sunday
mornings
she
could
sit
with
her
book
or
newspapers
as
the
calm
lengthened
into
midday
and
the
early
peace
was
broken
only
by
the
familiar
of
the
city
the
city
which
lay
below
was
house
built
on
bones
older
than
those
which
lay
beneath
the
of
or
was
this
knowledge
part
of
the
mystery
it
held
for
her
mystery
felt
most
strongly
on
bell
sunday
on
her
of
its
hidden
and
time
had
fascinated
her
from
childhood
its
apparent
power
to
move
at
different
the
it
wrought
on
minds
and
bodies
her
sense
that
each
moment
all
moments
past
and
those
to
come
were
into
an
present
which
with
every
breath
became
the
past
in
the
city
of
london
these
moments
were
caught
and
in
stone
and
brick
in
and
and
in
which
the
grey
brown
ever
flowing
she
would
walk
out
in
spring
or
summer
as
early
as
six
clock
double
the
front
door
behind
her
into
silence
more
profound
and
mysterious
than
the
absence
of
noise
sometimes
in
this
it
seemed
that
her
own
footsteps
were
as
if
some
part
of
her
were
afraid
to
the
dead
who
had
walked
these
streets
and
had
known
the
same
silence
she
knew
that
on
summer
weekends
few
hundred
yards
away
the
and
would
soon
be
pouring
over
the
bridge
the
river
would
move
with
from
their
and
the
public
city
would
become
alive
but
none
of
this
business
sanctuary
court
the
house
she
had
chosen
could
not
have
been
more
different
from
that
detached
in
green
the
east
london
where
she
had
been
born
and
in
which
she
had
spent
the
first
sixteen
years
of
her
life
now
she
would
take
the
first
step
on
path
which
might
her
to
those
years
or
if
were
impossible
at
least
them
of
their
power
it
was
now
eight
thirty
and
she
was
in
her
bathroom
turning
off
the
shower
she
moved
wrapped
to
the
mirror
over
the
she
put
out
her
hand
and
it
over
the
smeared
glass
and
watched
her
face
appear
pale
and
anonymous
as
painting
it
was
months
since
she
had
deliberately
touched
the
scar
now
slowly
and
she
ran
down
its
length
feeling
the
silver
at
its
heart
the
hard
of
its
edge
placing
her
left
hand
over
her
cheek
she
tried
to
imagine
the
stranger
who
in
few
weeks
time
would
look
into
the
same
mirror
and
see
of
herself
but
one
perhaps
with
only
thin
white
line
to
show
where
this
puckered
had
run
gazing
at
the
image
which
seemed
no
more
than
faint
of
her
self
she
began
slowly
and
deliberately
to
her
carefully
and
let
the
past
first
like
stream
and
then
river
in
break
through
and
take
possession
of
her
mind
she
was
back
in
that
small
rear
room
both
kitchen
and
sitting
room
in
which
she
and
her
parents
in
their
lies
and
endured
their
voluntary
from
life
the
front
room
with
its
bay
window
was
for
special
occasions
for
family
never
held
and
for
visitors
who
never
came
its
silence
smelling
of
furniture
polish
and
stale
air
an
air
so
that
she
tried
never
to
breathe
it
she
was
the
only
child
of
frightened
and
mother
and
father
that
was
how
she
had
defined
herself
for
more
than
thirty
years
and
how
she
still
defined
herself
her
childhood
and
had
been
by
shame
and
guilt
her
father
of
violence
were
no
school
friends
could
safely
be
brought
home
no
birthday
or
christmas
parties
arranged
and
since
no
were
ever
given
none
was
received
the
school
to
which
she
went
was
single
sex
and
between
the
girls
were
intense
special
mark
of
favour
was
to
be
invited
to
spend
the
night
at
friend
house
no
guest
ever
slept
at
the
didn
worry
her
she
knew
herself
to
be
more
intelligent
than
her
and
was
able
to
persuade
herself
that
she
had
no
need
of
which
would
be
and
which
she
knew
would
never
be
offered
it
was
eleven
thirty
on
friday
the
night
her
father
got
paid
the
worst
day
of
the
week
and
now
there
came
the
sound
she
dreaded
the
sharp
closing
of
the
front
door
he
came
in
and
she
saw
her
mother
move
in
front
of
the
armchair
which
rhoda
knew
would
his
fury
it
was
to
be
her
father
chair
he
had
chosen
it
paid
for
it
and
it
had
been
that
morning
only
after
the
van
had
left
had
her
mother
discovered
it
was
the
wrong
colour
it
would
have
to
be
changed
but
there
had
been
no
time
before
the
shop
closed
she
knew
that
her
mother
half
whining
voice
would
him
that
her
own
presence
would
help
neither
of
them
but
she
couldn
go
up
to
bed
the
noise
of
what
would
happen
beneath
her
room
would
be
more
terrifying
than
to
be
part
of
it
and
now
the
room
was
full
of
him
his
body
the
stink
of
him
hearing
his
of
outrage
his
she
felt
sudden
of
fury
and
with
it
came
courage
she
heard
herself
saying
it
isn
mother
fault
the
chair
was
wrapped
up
when
the
man
left
it
she
couldn
see
it
was
the
wrong
colour
they
ll
have
to
change
it
and
then
he
turned
on
her
she
couldn
recall
the
words
perhaps
at
the
time
there
had
been
no
words
or
she
hadn
heard
them
there
was
only
the
crack
of
the
smashed
bottle
like
shot
the
stink
of
moment
of
pain
which
passed
almost
as
soon
as
she
felt
it
and
the
warm
blood
flowing
from
her
cheek
onto
the
seat
of
the
chair
her
mother
cry
oh
god
look
what
you
ve
done
rhoda
the
blood
they
ll
never
take
it
back
now
they
ll
never
change
it
her
father
gave
her
one
look
before
out
and
himself
up
to
bed
in
the
seconds
in
which
their
eyes
met
she
thought
she
saw
confusion
of
emotions
horror
and
then
her
mother
finally
turned
her
attention
to
her
child
rhoda
had
been
trying
to
hold
the
of
the
wound
together
the
blood
on
her
hands
her
mother
and
packet
of
sticking
and
tried
with
shaking
hands
to
open
it
her
tears
with
the
blood
it
was
rhoda
who
gently
took
the
packet
from
her
the
from
their
covers
and
managed
at
last
to
close
most
of
the
wound
by
the
time
less
than
an
hour
later
she
was
lying
in
bed
the
had
been
and
the
future
out
there
would
be
no
visit
to
the
doctor
and
no
explanation
ever
she
would
stay
away
from
school
for
day
or
two
her
mother
would
telephone
saying
she
was
and
when
she
did
go
back
her
story
would
be
ready
she
had
crashed
against
the
edge
of
the
open
kitchen
door
and
now
the
sharp
edged
memory
of
that
single
moment
softened
into
the
more
recollection
of
the
following
years
the
wound
which
became
badly
painfully
and
slowly
but
neither
parent
spoke
of
it
her
father
had
always
found
it
difficult
to
meet
her
eyes
now
he
hardly
ever
came
near
her
her
their
gaze
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
fear
had
replaced
dislike
no
one
at
school
ever
mentioned
the
in
her
presence
until
she
was
in
the
sixth
form
and
was
sitting
with
her
english
who
was
trying
to
persuade
her
to
try
for
cambridge
her
own
university
instead
of
london
without
looking
up
from
her
papers
miss
had
said
your
scar
rhoda
it
wonderful
what
plastic
surgeons
can
do
today
perhaps
it
would
be
sensible
to
make
an
appointment
with
your
gp
before
you
go
up
their
eyes
had
met
rhoda
with
outrage
and
after
four
seconds
of
silence
miss
in
her
chair
her
face
an
angry
rash
of
mottled
scarlet
had
bent
again
to
her
papers
she
began
to
be
treated
with
wary
respect
neither
dislike
nor
respect
worried
her
she
had
her
own
private
life
an
interest
in
finding
out
what
others
kept
hidden
in
making
into
other
people
secrets
became
obsession
the
and
direction
of
her
whole
career
she
became
of
minds
eighteen
years
after
she
had
left
green
the
had
been
by
notorious
murder
she
had
studied
the
pictures
of
victim
and
killer
in
the
papers
with
no
particular
interest
the
killer
confessed
within
days
was
taken
away
the
case
closed
as
an
investigative
journalist
by
now
becoming
increasingly
successful
she
was
interested
less
by
green
brief
than
by
her
own
more
and
more
and
lines
of
enquiry
she
had
left
home
on
her
birthday
and
found
bed
sit
in
the
next
every
week
until
he
died
her
father
sent
her
five
note
she
never
acknowledged
it
but
took
the
money
because
she
needed
it
to
the
cash
she
in
the
evenings
and
at
weekends
working
as
waitress
telling
herself
that
it
was
probably
less
than
her
food
would
have
cost
at
home
when
five
years
later
with
first
in
history
and
established
in
her
first
job
her
mother
phoned
to
say
that
her
father
had
died
she
felt
an
absence
of
emotion
that
seemed
stronger
and
more
than
regret
he
had
been
found
drowned
slumped
in
an
stream
whose
name
she
could
never
remember
with
an
alcohol
level
in
his
blood
which
proved
that
he
had
been
the
coroner
of
death
was
expected
and
she
thought
probably
it
was
the
one
she
had
hoped
for
she
told
herself
not
without
small
of
shame
which
quickly
died
that
suicide
would
have
been
too
rational
and
final
judgement
on
such
an
life
the
was
quicker
than
she
had
expected
she
arrived
too
early
at
street
and
asked
the
driver
to
stop
at
the
road
end
of
the
street
then
walked
to
her
appointment
as
on
the
rare
occasions
when
she
had
passed
this
way
she
was
struck
by
the
street
the
almost
calm
which
hung
over
these
formal
eighteenth
century
almost
every
door
bore
plate
with
list
of
names
what
surely
every
would
know
that
this
was
the
of
medical
somewhere
behind
these
front
doors
and
windows
patients
must
be
waiting
in
various
of
anxiety
apprehension
hope
or
despair
yet
she
seldom
saw
any
of
them
arriving
or
the
occasional
or
would
come
and
go
but
otherwise
the
street
could
have
been
an
empty
set
awaiting
the
arrival
of
and
arriving
at
the
door
she
studied
the
of
names
there
were
two
surgeons
and
three
and
the
name
she
expected
to
see
was
there
at
the
top
mr
chandler
powell
the
last
two
letters
which
proclaimed
that
surgeon
had
reached
the
of
and
reputation
of
surgery
it
had
she
thought
fine
ring
to
it
the
surgeons
their
by
viii
would
be
surprised
to
know
how
far
they
had
come
the
door
was
opened
by
serious
faced
young
woman
in
white
coat
cut
to
compliment
her
figure
she
was
attractive
but
not
so
and
her
brief
smile
was
more
than
warm
rhoda
thought
head
girl
girl
there
was
one
in
every
sixth
form
the
waiting
room
into
which
she
was
shown
so
her
that
momentarily
she
had
the
impression
that
she
had
been
there
before
it
managed
to
achieve
certain
while
containing
nothing
of
real
quality
the
large
central
mahogany
table
with
its
of
country
life
and
and
the
more
women
magazines
so
carefully
as
to
reading
was
impressive
but
not
elegant
the
chairs
some
upright
others
more
comfortable
looked
as
if
they
had
been
acquired
in
country
house
sale
but
had
seldom
been
used
the
prints
were
large
and
enough
to
and
she
doubted
whether
the
two
high
on
the
mantelpiece
were
genuine
none
of
the
patients
except
herself
gave
any
to
the
particular
they
required
as
always
she
was
able
to
them
knowing
that
no
curious
eyes
would
be
fixed
for
long
on
her
they
glanced
up
as
she
entered
but
there
were
no
brief
of
to
become
patient
was
to
part
of
to
be
received
into
system
which
however
benign
subtly
one
of
almost
of
will
they
sat
patiently
in
their
private
middle
aged
woman
child
in
the
chair
beside
her
gazed
into
space
the
child
bored
restless
eyed
began
gently
knocking
her
feet
against
the
chair
legs
until
without
looking
at
her
the
woman
put
out
hand
opposite
them
young
man
who
looked
in
his
formal
suit
the
of
city
took
the
financial
times
from
his
briefcase
and
it
with
concentrated
his
attention
on
the
page
dressed
woman
moved
silently
to
the
table
and
studied
the
magazines
then
the
choice
returned
to
her
seat
next
to
the
window
and
continued
her
at
the
empty
street
rhoda
was
not
kept
waiting
for
long
the
same
young
woman
who
had
let
her
in
came
over
to
her
speaking
softly
and
saying
that
mr
chandler
powell
could
see
her
now
with
his
obviously
started
in
the
waiting
room
she
was
shown
into
large
light
room
across
the
hall
the
two
tall
double
windows
facing
the
street
were
in
heavy
linen
and
with
white
almost
net
the
winter
sunlight
the
room
had
none
of
the
furniture
or
equipment
she
had
half
expected
drawing
room
rather
than
an
office
an
attractive
screen
decorated
with
scene
of
river
and
distant
stood
in
the
to
the
left
of
the
door
it
was
obviously
old
possibly
eighteenth
century
perhaps
she
thought
it
concealed
or
even
although
this
seemed
unlikely
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
anyone
taking
his
or
her
clothes
off
in
this
domestic
if
setting
there
were
two
armchairs
one
each
side
of
the
fireplace
and
mahogany
desk
facing
the
door
two
upright
chairs
before
it
the
only
oil
picture
was
over
the
mantelpiece
large
painting
of
tudor
house
with
an
eighteenth
century
family
carefully
grouped
in
front
of
it
the
father
and
two
sons
mounted
the
wife
and
three
young
daughters
in
on
the
opposite
wall
was
row
of
coloured
prints
of
eighteenth
century
london
they
and
the
oil
added
to
her
sense
of
being
subtly
out
of
time
mr
chandler
powell
had
been
sitting
at
the
desk
and
as
she
entered
he
rose
and
came
to
shake
her
hand
one
of
the
two
chairs
his
grasp
was
firm
but
momentary
his
hand
cool
she
had
expected
him
to
be
wearing
dark
suit
instead
he
was
in
very
pale
grey
fine
tweed
cut
which
gave
greater
impression
of
facing
him
she
saw
strong
face
with
long
mobile
mouth
and
bright
eyes
under
well
marked
brows
his
brown
hair
straight
and
little
was
brushed
over
high
forehead
few
falling
almost
into
his
right
eye
the
immediate
impression
he
gave
was
of
confidence
and
she
recognised
it
at
once
which
had
something
but
not
everything
to
do
with
success
it
was
different
from
the
confidence
with
which
as
journalist
she
was
familiar
their
eyes
always
for
the
next
photographer
at
the
ready
to
assume
the
right
who
seemed
to
know
that
their
was
of
the
media
which
only
their
desperate
self
belief
could
maintain
the
man
before
her
had
the
inner
assurance
of
someone
at
the
top
of
his
profession
secure
she
detected
too
hint
of
arrogance
not
altogether
successfully
concealed
but
told
herself
that
this
could
be
of
surgery
well
he
looked
the
part
you
come
miss
gradwyn
without
letter
from
your
gp
it
was
stated
as
fact
not
his
voice
was
deep
and
attractive
but
with
trace
of
country
accent
which
she
couldn
identify
and
hadn
expected
it
seemed
waste
of
his
time
and
mine
registered
with
dr
practice
about
eight
years
ago
as
an
patient
and
have
never
needed
to
consult
either
him
or
any
of
his
only
go
to
the
surgery
twice
year
to
have
my
blood
pressure
taken
that
usually
done
by
the
practice
nurse
know
dr
ll
have
word
with
him
without
speaking
he
came
up
to
her
turning
the
desk
lamp
so
that
its
bright
shone
full
on
her
face
his
fingers
were
cool
as
they
touched
the
skin
on
each
cheek
it
into
the
touch
was
so
impersonal
that
it
seemed
an
she
wondered
why
he
hadn
disappeared
behind
the
screen
to
wash
his
hands
but
perhaps
if
he
considered
it
necessary
for
this
preliminary
appointment
this
had
been
done
before
she
entered
the
room
there
was
moment
in
which
not
touching
the
scar
he
it
in
silence
then
he
switched
off
the
light
and
sat
again
behind
the
desk
his
eyes
on
the
file
before
him
he
said
how
long
ago
was
this
done
she
was
struck
by
the
of
the
question
thirty
four
years
ago
how
did
it
happen
she
said
is
that
necessary
question
not
unless
it
was
self
assume
it
wasn
no
it
wasn
self
and
you
have
waited
thirty
four
years
to
do
something
about
it
why
now
miss
gradwyn
there
was
pause
then
she
said
because
no
longer
have
need
of
it
he
didn
reply
but
the
hand
making
notes
in
the
file
was
for
few
seconds
looking
up
from
his
papers
he
said
what
are
you
expecting
from
this
operation
miss
gradwyn
should
like
the
scar
to
but
realise
that
impossible
suppose
what
hoping
for
is
thin
line
not
this
wide
he
said
think
with
the
help
of
some
make
up
it
could
be
almost
invisible
after
surgery
if
necessary
you
can
be
referred
to
nurse
for
these
nurses
are
very
it
surprising
what
can
be
done
prefer
not
to
have
to
use
very
little
or
none
may
be
necessary
but
it
deep
scar
as
expect
you
know
the
skin
is
and
it
will
be
necessary
to
open
up
and
those
for
time
after
the
operation
the
scar
will
look
red
and
great
deal
worse
before
it
gets
better
we
ll
need
to
deal
too
with
the
effect
on
the
fold
that
small
of
the
lip
and
the
top
of
the
scar
where
it
down
the
corner
of
the
eye
at
the
finish
shall
use
fat
to
plump
up
and
any
but
when
see
you
the
day
before
the
operation
shall
explain
in
more
detail
what
propose
to
do
and
show
you
the
operation
will
be
done
under
general
anaesthetic
have
you
ever
been
no
this
will
be
my
first
time
the
anaesthetist
will
see
you
before
the
operation
there
are
some
would
like
done
including
blood
and
an
but
would
prefer
those
to
be
carried
out
at
st
angela
the
scar
will
be
before
and
after
the
operation
she
said
the
of
fat
you
mentioned
what
kind
of
fat
yours
by
it
from
your
stomach
of
course
she
thought
silly
question
he
said
when
were
you
thinking
of
having
it
done
have
private
beds
at
st
angela
or
you
could
come
to
cheverell
manor
my
clinic
in
dorset
if
you
prefer
to
be
out
of
london
the
date
can
offer
you
this
year
is
friday
the
of
december
that
would
have
to
be
at
the
manor
you
would
be
one
of
only
two
patients
at
that
time
as
shall
be
running
down
the
clinic
for
the
christmas
break
prefer
to
be
out
of
london
mrs
will
take
you
to
the
office
after
this
my
secretary
there
will
give
you
about
the
manor
how
long
you
stay
there
is
up
to
you
the
will
probably
come
out
on
the
sixth
day
and
very
few
patients
need
or
wish
to
stay
post
for
more
than
week
if
you
do
decide
on
the
manor
it
helpful
if
you
can
find
time
for
preliminary
visit
either
for
day
or
overnight
like
patients
to
see
where
they
re
to
be
operated
on
if
they
can
spare
the
time
it
disconcerting
to
arrive
at
totally
strange
place
she
said
is
the
wound
likely
to
be
painful
after
the
operation
mean
no
it
unlikely
to
be
painful
little
sore
perhaps
and
there
may
be
considerable
if
there
is
pain
we
can
deal
with
it
over
my
face
not
dressing
which
will
be
there
was
one
more
question
and
she
had
no
in
asking
it
although
she
thought
she
knew
the
answer
she
wasn
asking
out
of
fear
and
hoped
that
he
would
understand
this
without
caring
if
he
didn
would
this
be
described
as
dangerous
operation
there
is
always
some
risk
with
general
anaesthetic
as
far
as
the
surgery
is
concerned
it
will
be
time
consuming
delicate
and
likely
to
present
some
problems
those
will
be
my
responsibility
not
yours
it
would
not
be
described
as
dangerous
she
wondered
whether
he
was
that
there
might
be
other
problems
from
complete
in
appearance
she
didn
expect
any
she
had
with
the
of
the
scar
for
thirty
four
years
she
would
cope
with
its
he
had
asked
whether
she
had
any
other
questions
she
said
she
had
none
he
rose
and
they
shook
hands
and
for
the
first
time
he
smiled
it
transformed
his
face
he
said
my
secretary
will
send
you
the
when
can
fit
you
in
at
st
angela
for
the
will
that
present
problem
will
you
be
in
london
in
the
next
two
weeks
ll
be
in
london
she
followed
mrs
into
an
office
at
the
rear
of
the
ground
floor
where
middle
aged
woman
gave
her
about
the
at
the
manor
and
set
out
the
cost
both
of
the
visit
which
she
explained
mr
chandler
powell
thought
would
be
helpful
to
patients
but
which
wasn
of
course
and
the
greater
cost
of
the
operation
and
week
stay
she
had
expected
the
price
to
be
high
but
the
reality
was
beyond
her
no
doubt
the
figures
represented
social
rather
than
medical
advantage
she
seemed
to
remember
woman
say
of
course
always
go
to
the
manor
as
if
this
admitted
her
to
of
privileged
patients
she
knew
she
could
have
the
operation
under
the
but
there
was
waiting
list
for
non
urgent
cases
and
she
needed
privacy
speed
and
privacy
in
all
fields
had
become
an
expensive
she
was
shown
out
within
half
an
hour
of
arriving
there
was
an
hour
to
spare
before
she
was
due
at
the
she
would
walk
the
was
too
popular
restaurant
to
ensure
but
social
in
all
other
important
to
her
had
never
worried
her
where
robin
was
concerned
in
an
age
where
required
increasingly
even
the
most
desperate
gossip
page
would
hardly
waste
paragraph
on
the
disclosure
that
rhoda
gradwyn
the
distinguished
journalist
was
with
man
twenty
years
younger
than
herself
she
was
used
to
him
he
amused
her
he
opened
up
for
her
of
life
which
she
needed
however
to
experience
and
she
was
sorry
for
him
it
was
hardly
the
for
intimacy
and
on
her
part
there
was
none
he
confided
she
listened
she
supposed
that
she
must
be
some
satisfaction
from
the
relationship
or
why
was
she
still
willing
to
let
him
appropriate
even
area
of
her
life
when
she
thought
about
the
friendship
which
was
seldom
it
seemed
habit
which
imposed
no
more
than
an
occasional
lunch
or
dinner
at
her
and
which
it
would
be
more
time
consuming
and
awkward
to
end
than
to
continue
he
was
waiting
for
her
as
always
at
his
favourite
table
by
the
door
which
she
had
booked
and
as
she
entered
she
was
able
to
him
for
half
minute
before
he
raised
his
eyes
from
the
and
saw
her
she
was
struck
as
she
always
was
by
his
beauty
he
himself
seemed
unconscious
of
it
yet
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
anyone
so
could
be
of
the
prize
which
and
fate
had
on
him
or
fail
to
take
advantage
of
it
to
an
he
had
but
seeming
hardly
to
care
she
had
always
found
it
difficult
to
believe
what
experience
had
taught
her
that
men
and
women
could
be
physically
beautiful
without
also
some
of
mind
and
spirit
that
beauty
could
be
wasted
on
the
the
ignorant
or
the
stupid
it
was
his
looks
she
suspected
which
had
helped
gain
robin
boyton
his
place
at
drama
school
his
first
his
brief
appearance
in
television
which
promised
much
but
ended
after
three
nothing
ever
lasted
even
the
most
or
or
eventually
became
at
lines
not
learnt
not
attended
when
the
acting
failed
he
number
of
some
of
which
might
have
succeeded
had
his
enthusiasm
lasted
for
more
than
six
months
she
had
resisted
his
to
in
any
of
them
and
he
took
without
resentment
but
had
never
him
from
trying
again
he
got
to
his
feet
as
she
approached
the
table
and
holding
her
hand
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
she
saw
that
the
bottle
of
for
which
she
of
course
would
pay
was
already
in
the
third
of
it
drunk
he
said
lovely
to
see
you
rhoda
how
did
you
get
on
with
the
great
george
they
never
used
once
he
had
called
her
darling
but
it
was
not
word
he
had
ever
dared
to
she
said
the
great
george
is
that
what
they
call
chandler
powell
at
cheverell
manor
not
to
his
face
you
look
calm
after
your
ordeal
but
then
you
always
do
what
happened
ve
been
sitting
here
with
anxiety
nothing
happened
he
saw
me
he
looked
at
my
face
we
made
an
appointment
didn
he
impress
you
he
usually
does
his
appearance
is
impressive
wasn
with
him
long
enough
to
make
character
assessment
he
seemed
competent
have
you
ordered
do
ever
before
you
arrive
but
ve
an
for
both
of
us
know
what
you
like
ve
been
more
than
usual
about
the
wine
the
wine
list
she
saw
that
he
had
been
also
about
the
cost
they
had
hardly
started
on
their
first
course
when
he
introduced
what
was
for
him
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
he
said
looking
for
some
capital
not
much
few
it
first
opportunity
small
risk
well
none
really
and
return
about
ten
wondered
if
you
be
interested
he
described
as
his
business
partner
rhoda
doubted
whether
he
had
ever
been
more
than
that
she
had
only
met
him
once
and
had
found
him
but
and
not
without
sense
if
he
had
any
influence
over
robin
it
was
probably
for
the
good
she
said
always
interested
in
no
risk
with
return
of
ten
surprised
you
re
not
what
is
it
this
business
you
re
involved
in
with
the
same
as
told
you
about
when
we
had
dinner
in
well
things
have
moved
on
since
then
but
you
remember
the
idea
it
really
mine
not
but
we
ve
worked
on
it
together
you
mentioned
that
you
and
were
thinking
of
setting
up
some
classes
on
for
the
newly
rich
who
are
somehow
can
see
you
as
teacher
or
indeed
as
an
on
mug
it
up
from
books
it
surprisingly
easy
and
is
the
so
he
has
no
trouble
couldn
your
social
get
it
from
books
themselves
suppose
they
could
but
they
like
the
human
touch
we
give
them
confidence
that
what
they
re
paying
for
rhoda
we
ve
identified
real
market
opportunity
lot
of
young
people
well
young
men
and
not
only
the
rich
worry
that
they
don
know
what
to
wear
for
particular
occasions
what
to
do
if
they
re
taking
girl
out
to
good
restaurant
for
the
first
time
they
re
unsure
about
how
to
behave
in
company
how
to
impress
the
boss
has
this
house
in
which
he
bought
with
the
money
rich
aunt
left
him
so
we
re
using
it
at
present
we
have
to
be
of
course
isn
sure
it
can
be
used
for
business
we
live
in
fear
of
the
neighbours
one
of
the
ground
floor
rooms
is
set
up
as
restaurant
and
we
use
play
acting
after
bit
when
they
ve
got
confidence
we
take
the
clients
to
genuine
restaurant
not
this
place
but
others
not
too
which
give
us
special
the
clients
pay
of
course
we
re
doing
pretty
well
and
the
business
is
growing
but
we
need
another
house
or
at
least
flat
is
fed
up
with
giving
up
virtually
his
ground
floor
and
having
these
odd
characters
turning
up
when
he
wants
to
his
friends
and
then
there
the
office
he
had
to
one
of
the
bedrooms
for
that
he
getting
three
of
the
because
of
the
house
but
know
he
feels
it
time
paid
him
my
share
obviously
we
can
use
my
place
you
know
what
the
flat
like
hardly
the
we
re
looking
for
anyway
may
not
be
there
for
long
the
landlord
becoming
very
about
the
rent
once
we
get
separate
address
we
ll
be
ahead
well
what
do
you
think
rhoda
interested
interested
in
hearing
about
it
not
interested
in
with
any
money
but
it
could
it
more
reasonable
than
most
of
your
previous
anyway
good
luck
so
the
answer
no
the
answer
no
she
added
on
impulse
you
must
wait
for
my
will
prefer
to
of
my
charity
after
death
it
easier
to
with
money
when
you
ll
have
no
further
use
for
it
yourself
she
had
left
him
twenty
thousand
pounds
in
her
will
not
sufficient
to
one
of
his
more
but
enough
to
ensure
that
relief
at
being
left
anything
would
disappointment
at
the
amount
it
gave
her
pleasure
to
watch
his
face
she
felt
small
regret
too
close
to
shame
to
be
comfortable
that
she
had
and
was
enjoying
his
first
flush
of
surprise
and
pleasure
the
of
in
his
eyes
and
then
the
swift
into
why
had
she
bothered
merely
to
confirm
once
again
what
she
already
knew
about
him
he
said
you
ve
definitely
decided
on
cheverell
manor
not
one
of
chandler
powell
private
beds
at
st
angela
prefer
to
be
out
of
london
where
there
greater
chance
of
peace
and
privacy
making
preliminary
overnight
stay
on
the
apparently
that
on
offer
he
likes
his
patients
to
be
familiar
with
the
place
before
he
he
likes
the
money
too
so
do
you
robin
so
don
be
keeping
his
eyes
on
his
plate
he
said
thinking
of
visiting
the
manor
while
you
re
in
thought
you
welcome
gossip
convalescence
is
boring
no
robin
won
welcome
gossip
booked
into
the
manor
specifically
to
ensure
ll
be
left
alone
imagine
the
staff
there
will
see
to
it
that
isn
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
place
that
rather
grudging
of
you
the
manor
to
you
would
you
be
going
there
if
it
weren
for
me
as
you
re
not
doctor
and
have
never
had
surgery
not
sure
what
your
would
be
worth
you
have
mentioned
the
manor
occasionally
but
that
all
had
already
heard
of
george
chandler
powell
as
he
recognised
as
one
of
the
six
best
plastic
surgeons
in
england
probably
in
and
surgery
is
becoming
as
as
health
that
hardly
surprising
looked
him
up
compared
his
record
took
advice
and
chose
him
but
you
haven
told
me
what
your
connection
is
with
cheverell
manor
better
know
in
case
mention
casually
that
know
you
and
am
met
with
and
to
the
worst
bedroom
that
could
happen
not
exactly
their
favourite
visitor
don
actually
stay
in
the
house
that
would
be
going
bit
far
for
both
parties
they
ve
got
cottage
for
visitors
rose
cottage
and
book
in
there
have
to
pay
too
which
think
is
bit
much
they
don
even
send
over
the
food
don
usually
get
vacancy
in
summer
but
they
can
hardly
claim
the
cottage
isn
free
in
december
you
said
you
were
some
kind
of
not
of
chandler
powell
his
surgical
assistant
marcus
westhall
is
my
cousin
he
with
the
and
looks
after
the
patients
when
the
great
george
is
in
london
marcus
lives
there
with
his
sister
candace
in
the
other
cottage
she
doesn
have
anything
to
do
with
the
patients
she
in
the
office
their
only
living
you
have
thought
that
that
would
mean
something
to
them
and
it
doesn
better
tell
you
some
family
history
if
it
won
bore
you
it
goes
back
long
way
ll
try
to
make
it
brief
it
about
money
of
course
it
usually
is
it
sad
sad
story
about
poor
boy
who
thrown
on
the
world
it
pity
to
your
heart
with
it
now
wouldn
like
tears
to
fall
into
your
delicious
dressed
ll
take
the
risk
it
as
well
to
know
something
about
the
place
before
go
wondered
what
lay
behind
this
invitation
to
lunch
if
you
want
to
go
prepared
you
ve
come
to
the
right
person
well
worth
the
cost
of
good
meal
he
spoke
without
rancour
but
his
smile
was
amused
she
reminded
herself
that
it
was
never
to
him
he
had
never
before
spoken
to
her
about
his
family
history
or
his
past
for
man
so
ready
to
the
of
his
daily
existence
his
small
and
more
common
in
love
and
business
usually
with
humour
he
was
about
his
early
life
rhoda
suspected
that
his
childhood
might
have
been
deeply
unhappy
and
that
this
early
from
which
no
one
totally
could
be
at
the
of
his
since
she
had
no
intention
of
to
with
his
was
life
she
had
had
no
compulsion
to
but
there
were
things
about
cheverell
manor
which
it
would
be
useful
to
know
in
advance
she
would
come
to
the
manor
as
patient
and
for
her
this
implied
and
certain
physical
and
emotional
to
arrive
was
to
put
at
from
the
start
she
said
tell
me
about
your
cousins
they
re
comfortably
off
at
least
by
my
and
about
to
be
very
rich
by
anyone
their
father
my
uncle
peregrine
died
nine
months
ago
and
left
them
about
eight
million
between
them
he
inherited
from
his
father
who
died
only
few
weeks
before
him
the
family
fortune
came
from
him
you
have
probably
heard
of
westhall
and
first
steps
in
learning
something
like
that
anyway
didn
come
across
them
myself
wasn
at
that
kind
of
school
anyway
if
they
become
standard
by
long
use
are
good
never
out
of
and
the
old
man
was
good
with
money
he
had
the
of
making
it
grow
rhoda
said
surprised
there
so
much
for
your
cousins
to
with
two
deaths
so
close
together
father
and
grandfather
the
death
duties
must
have
been
old
grandfather
had
thought
of
that
told
you
he
was
clever
with
money
he
took
out
some
form
of
insurance
before
his
last
illness
started
anyway
the
money
there
they
ll
get
it
as
soon
as
probate
is
granted
and
you
like
part
of
it
frankly
think
part
of
it
westhall
had
two
children
peregrine
and
was
my
mother
her
marriage
to
keith
boyton
was
never
popular
with
her
father
in
fact
believe
he
tried
to
stop
it
he
thought
keith
was
gold
who
was
only
after
the
family
money
and
to
be
honest
he
probably
wasn
far
wrong
poor
mummy
died
when
was
seven
was
brought
up
well
it
was
more
like
being
dragged
around
by
my
dad
anyway
in
the
end
he
gave
up
and
dumped
me
into
that
hall
of
school
an
on
but
not
much
charity
paid
the
such
as
they
were
it
was
no
school
for
pretty
boy
particularly
one
with
the
charity
child
hung
round
his
neck
he
was
his
as
if
it
were
his
knuckles
white
for
moment
rhoda
feared
that
it
would
in
his
hand
then
he
his
grip
smiled
at
her
and
raised
the
glass
to
his
lips
he
said
from
the
time
of
mummy
marriage
the
were
cut
off
from
the
family
the
westhalls
never
forget
and
they
never
forgive
where
is
he
now
your
father
frankly
rhoda
haven
the
slightest
idea
he
to
when
won
my
to
drama
school
we
haven
been
in
touch
since
he
may
be
married
or
dead
or
both
for
all
know
we
were
never
what
you
call
close
and
he
didn
even
support
us
poor
mummy
learnt
to
type
and
went
out
to
in
pool
an
odd
expression
pool
don
think
they
have
them
now
poor
mummy
was
particularly
thought
you
said
you
were
an
possibly
am
anyway
if
my
father
not
dead
he
hardly
present
not
even
for
eight
years
if
he
isn
dead
he
ll
be
getting
on
he
was
fifteen
years
older
than
my
mother
so
that
makes
him
over
sixty
so
he
unlikely
to
appear
demanding
little
financial
help
from
the
well
he
wouldn
get
it
if
he
did
haven
seen
the
will
but
when
rang
the
family
solicitor
just
out
of
interest
you
understand
he
told
me
he
wouldn
give
me
copy
of
it
he
said
could
get
copy
when
probate
had
been
granted
don
think
ll
bother
the
westhalls
would
leave
money
to
home
before
they
left
to
boyton
my
claim
is
on
the
grounds
of
justice
not
their
cousin
ve
kept
in
touch
they
ve
got
more
than
enough
cash
to
spare
and
they
ll
be
very
rich
once
probate
is
granted
it
wouldn
hurt
them
to
show
little
now
that
why
visit
like
to
remind
them
that
exist
uncle
peregrine
only
thirty
five
days
after
grandfather
bet
old
hung
on
as
long
as
he
could
just
in
the
hope
of
his
son
don
know
what
would
have
happened
if
uncle
peregrine
had
died
first
but
whatever
the
legal
nothing
would
have
come
to
me
rhoda
said
your
cousins
must
have
been
anxious
though
there
in
all
wills
saying
that
the
has
to
twenty
eight
days
after
the
death
of
the
if
he
is
to
imagine
they
took
good
care
to
keep
their
father
alive
that
is
if
he
did
for
those
eight
days
perhaps
they
him
into
freezer
and
produced
him
nice
and
fresh
on
the
appropriate
day
that
the
of
book
by
detective
think
it
called
death
but
it
may
have
been
under
different
name
can
remember
much
about
it
read
it
years
ago
he
was
an
elegant
he
was
silent
and
she
saw
that
he
poured
the
wine
as
if
his
thoughts
were
she
thought
with
amusement
and
some
concern
my
god
is
he
really
taking
this
nonsense
seriously
if
so
and
he
started
it
the
was
likely
to
finish
him
with
his
cousins
she
could
think
of
few
more
likely
to
close
rose
cottage
and
cheverell
manor
to
him
for
ever
than
an
of
the
novel
had
come
unexpectedly
to
mind
and
she
had
spoken
without
thinking
that
he
should
take
her
words
seriously
was
bizarre
he
said
as
if
shaking
it
off
the
idea
is
of
course
of
course
it
is
what
do
you
candace
and
marcus
westhall
turning
up
at
the
hospital
while
their
father
is
in
on
taking
him
home
and
him
into
convenient
freezer
the
moment
he
then
him
out
eight
days
later
they
wouldn
need
to
go
to
hospital
candace
him
at
home
for
the
last
two
years
the
two
old
men
grandfather
and
uncle
peregrine
were
in
the
same
nursing
home
outside
bournemouth
but
were
such
trial
to
the
nursing
staff
that
the
management
said
one
of
them
would
have
to
go
peregrine
demanded
to
be
taken
in
by
candace
and
there
he
stayed
to
the
last
looked
after
by
local
gp
never
saw
him
during
those
last
two
years
he
refused
all
visitors
it
could
have
worked
she
said
not
really
tell
me
about
the
other
people
at
the
manor
apart
from
your
cousins
the
main
ones
anyway
whom
shall
meet
well
there
the
great
george
himself
naturally
then
there
the
queen
of
the
nursing
services
sister
flavia
holland
very
if
turn
you
on
won
worry
you
with
the
other
nursing
staff
most
of
them
come
in
by
car
from
wareham
bournemouth
or
the
anaesthetist
was
an
who
took
as
much
as
he
could
stomach
from
the
health
service
and
retired
to
an
agreeable
little
cottage
on
the
part
time
job
at
the
manor
him
very
well
and
then
more
there
helena
cressett
she
called
the
general
administrator
which
covers
practically
everything
from
to
keeping
an
eye
on
the
books
she
came
to
the
manor
after
her
divorce
six
years
ago
the
thing
about
helena
is
her
name
her
father
sir
cressett
sold
the
manor
to
george
after
the
lloyd
he
was
in
wrong
and
lost
everything
when
george
the
job
of
general
administrator
helena
cressett
applied
and
got
it
anyone
more
sensitive
than
george
wouldn
have
taken
her
on
but
she
knew
the
house
and
gather
she
made
herself
which
is
clever
of
her
she
of
me
how
of
her
yes
isn
it
but
then
think
she
of
practically
everyone
there
certain
amount
of
family
there
after
all
her
family
owned
the
manor
for
nearly
four
hundred
years
oh
and
should
mention
the
two
dean
and
kim
bostock
george
must
have
them
from
somewhere
rather
good
told
the
food
is
excellent
but
ve
never
been
invited
to
taste
it
then
there
mrs
frensham
helena
old
who
in
charge
of
the
office
she
the
widow
of
of
priest
and
looks
the
part
so
it
rather
like
having
an
uncomfortable
public
on
two
legs
the
place
to
remind
one
of
one
and
there
strange
girl
they
ve
picked
up
from
somewhere
sharon
bateman
who
kind
of
doing
jobs
in
the
kitchen
and
for
miss
cressett
she
around
carrying
trays
that
about
all
as
far
as
you
ll
be
concerned
how
do
you
know
all
this
robin
by
keeping
eyes
and
ears
open
when
drinking
with
the
in
the
village
pub
the
cressett
arms
the
only
one
who
does
not
that
they
re
given
to
gossiping
with
strangers
to
common
belief
don
but
pick
up
few
the
cressett
family
in
the
late
century
had
row
with
the
local
and
no
longer
went
to
church
the
village
with
the
and
the
continued
down
the
as
they
often
do
george
chandler
powell
has
done
nothing
to
it
actually
it
him
the
patients
go
there
for
privacy
and
he
doesn
want
lot
of
chat
about
them
in
the
village
couple
of
village
women
come
in
as
part
of
the
house
cleaning
team
but
most
of
the
staff
come
from
further
and
then
there
old
mog
mr
mogworthy
he
worked
as
for
the
and
george
has
kept
him
on
he
mine
of
information
if
you
know
how
to
get
it
out
of
him
don
believe
it
believe
what
don
believe
that
name
it
totally
nobody
can
be
called
mogworthy
he
is
he
me
there
was
of
that
name
at
holy
church
in
the
late
century
mogworthy
to
be
descended
from
him
he
could
hardly
be
if
the
first
mogworthy
was
priest
he
would
be
well
descended
from
the
same
family
anyway
there
he
is
he
used
to
live
in
the
cottage
which
marcus
and
candace
now
occupy
but
george
wanted
the
cottage
and
kicked
him
out
he
now
with
his
aged
sister
in
the
village
yes
mog
mine
of
information
dorset
is
full
of
most
of
them
horrific
and
mog
is
the
actually
he
wasn
born
in
the
county
all
his
were
but
his
dad
moved
to
before
mog
was
born
get
him
to
tell
you
about
the
cheverell
stones
ve
never
heard
of
them
oh
you
will
if
mog
around
and
you
can
hardly
miss
them
it
circle
in
field
next
to
the
manor
the
story
is
rather
horrible
tell
me
no
ll
leave
it
to
mog
or
sharon
mog
says
she
with
the
stones
the
was
their
main
and
robin
was
silent
contemplating
the
food
with
approval
she
sensed
he
was
losing
interest
in
cheverell
manor
the
talk
became
his
mind
obviously
until
they
were
drinking
their
coffee
then
he
turned
his
eyes
on
her
and
she
was
struck
again
by
the
and
of
their
almost
the
power
of
his
concentrated
gaze
was
stretching
his
hand
across
the
table
he
said
rhoda
come
back
to
the
flat
this
afternoon
now
please
it
important
we
need
to
talk
we
have
been
talking
mostly
about
you
and
the
manor
not
about
us
isn
expecting
you
shouldn
you
be
your
clients
on
how
to
cope
with
terrifying
and
wine
the
ones
teach
mostly
come
in
the
evening
please
rhoda
she
bent
to
pick
up
her
bag
sorry
robin
but
it
not
possible
ve
lot
to
get
through
before
go
to
the
manor
it
is
possible
it
always
possible
you
mean
you
don
want
to
come
it
possible
but
at
the
moment
it
isn
convenient
let
talk
after
the
operation
that
might
be
too
late
too
late
for
what
for
lot
of
things
can
you
see
that
terrified
that
you
might
be
planning
to
me
you
re
making
big
change
aren
you
perhaps
you
re
thinking
of
getting
rid
of
more
than
your
scar
it
was
the
first
time
in
the
six
years
of
their
relationship
that
they
had
ever
spoken
the
word
never
acknowledged
between
them
had
been
broken
getting
up
from
the
table
the
paid
she
tried
to
keep
the
note
of
outrage
from
her
voice
without
looking
at
him
she
said
sorry
robin
we
ll
talk
after
the
operation
ll
be
taking
back
to
the
city
is
there
anywhere
that
you
would
like
to
be
dropped
that
was
usual
he
never
travelled
by
the
word
she
realised
had
been
unfortunate
he
shook
his
head
but
didn
reply
and
followed
her
in
silence
to
the
door
outside
turning
to
take
their
different
ways
he
suddenly
said
when
say
goodbye
always
fear
that
may
not
see
that
person
again
when
my
mother
went
to
work
used
to
watch
from
the
window
was
terrified
that
she
might
never
come
home
do
you
ever
feel
that
not
unless
the
person
from
is
over
and
frail
or
from
illness
neither
but
as
they
finally
parted
she
paused
and
for
the
first
time
turned
to
watch
his
back
until
he
was
out
of
sight
she
had
no
dread
of
the
operation
no
of
death
mr
chandler
powell
had
said
that
there
was
always
some
risk
in
general
anaesthetic
but
in
hands
that
could
be
yet
as
he
disappeared
and
she
turned
away
she
shared
for
moment
robin
irrational
fear
by
two
clock
on
tuesday
november
rhoda
was
ready
to
leave
for
her
first
visit
to
cheverell
manor
her
had
been
completed
and
on
time
as
they
always
were
she
was
never
able
to
leave
home
even
for
single
night
without
cleaning
of
up
of
papers
in
her
study
and
final
check
of
doors
and
windows
whatever
place
she
called
home
had
to
be
immaculate
before
she
left
as
if
this
could
that
she
would
return
safely
she
had
been
sent
instructions
for
the
drive
to
dorset
with
the
about
the
manor
but
as
always
with
an
unfamiliar
route
she
the
route
on
card
to
be
placed
on
the
the
morning
had
been
but
despite
her
late
start
getting
out
of
london
had
been
slow
and
by
the
time
nearly
two
hours
later
she
left
the
and
had
joined
the
road
darkness
was
already
falling
and
with
it
came
heavy
of
rain
which
within
seconds
became
the
like
living
things
were
to
cope
with
the
she
could
see
nothing
ahead
but
the
of
her
on
water
which
was
fast
becoming
small
she
saw
few
other
car
lights
it
was
hopeless
to
try
to
drive
on
and
she
peered
out
through
wall
of
rain
looking
for
grass
verge
which
might
offer
firm
standing
within
minutes
she
was
able
to
drive
on
to
few
yards
of
level
ground
heavy
gate
at
least
here
there
would
be
no
risk
of
hidden
or
soft
wheel
she
turned
off
the
engine
and
listened
to
the
rain
the
roof
like
of
under
the
the
held
peace
which
intensified
the
outside
she
knew
that
beyond
the
cropped
invisible
lay
some
of
the
most
beautiful
in
england
but
now
she
felt
in
an
both
alien
and
she
had
switched
off
her
mobile
phone
as
always
with
relief
no
one
in
the
world
knew
where
she
was
or
could
reach
her
no
cars
passed
and
peering
through
the
she
saw
only
the
wall
of
water
and
beyond
it
trembling
of
light
which
marked
the
distant
houses
usually
she
welcomed
silence
and
was
able
to
her
imagination
she
contemplated
the
coming
operation
without
fear
while
that
she
had
some
rational
cause
for
anxiety
to
be
given
general
anaesthetic
was
never
without
risk
but
now
she
was
aware
of
an
unease
which
went
deeper
than
worry
about
either
this
preliminary
visit
or
the
surgery
it
was
she
realised
too
close
to
to
be
comfortable
as
if
some
reality
unknown
to
her
or
thrust
out
of
consciousness
was
gradually
making
its
presence
felt
and
demanding
to
be
recognised
it
was
useless
to
listen
to
music
above
the
of
the
so
she
slid
back
her
seat
and
closed
her
eyes
memories
some
old
some
more
recent
into
her
mind
she
once
again
the
day
in
may
six
months
ago
which
had
brought
her
to
this
journey
this
stretch
of
deserted
road
her
mother
letter
had
arrived
with
of
boring
post
of
meetings
she
had
no
intention
of
bills
letters
from
her
mother
were
even
than
their
brief
telephone
conversations
and
she
took
up
the
more
square
and
than
the
ones
her
mother
normally
used
with
slight
that
something
could
be
wrong
illness
problems
with
the
bungalow
her
presence
needed
but
it
was
wedding
invitation
the
card
printed
in
by
pictures
of
wedding
announced
that
mrs
gradwyn
and
mr
brown
hoped
that
their
friends
would
join
them
to
their
wedding
the
date
time
and
name
of
the
church
were
given
and
hotel
at
which
guests
would
be
welcome
at
the
reception
note
in
her
mother
handwriting
said
do
come
if
you
can
rhoda
don
know
whether
ve
mentioned
in
my
letters
he
and
his
wife
was
great
friend
of
mine
he
looking
forward
to
meeting
you
she
remembered
her
emotions
surprise
followed
by
relief
of
which
she
was
slightly
ashamed
that
this
marriage
could
remove
part
of
her
responsibility
for
her
mother
might
her
guilt
over
her
letters
and
telephone
calls
and
even
meetings
they
met
as
polite
but
wary
strangers
still
inhibited
by
the
things
they
couldn
say
the
memories
they
took
care
not
to
she
couldn
remember
hearing
about
and
had
no
desire
to
meet
him
but
this
was
an
invitation
she
had
an
to
accept
and
now
she
that
day
which
had
promised
only
endured
but
which
had
led
her
to
this
rain
moment
and
to
all
that
lay
ahead
she
had
set
off
in
good
time
but
had
its
on
the
motorway
and
when
she
arrived
outside
the
church
victorian
building
she
heard
the
uncertain
singing
of
what
must
be
the
last
she
waited
in
the
car
little
way
down
the
street
until
the
middle
aged
or
elderly
had
emerged
car
with
white
had
drawn
up
but
she
was
too
distant
to
see
her
mother
or
the
she
followed
the
car
with
others
leaving
the
church
to
the
hotel
which
was
some
four
miles
further
down
the
much
building
by
and
backed
by
golf
course
of
dark
on
the
suggested
that
the
had
intended
tudor
but
had
been
by
to
add
central
and
front
door
the
reception
hall
had
an
air
of
long
faded
curtains
of
red
hung
in
and
the
carpet
