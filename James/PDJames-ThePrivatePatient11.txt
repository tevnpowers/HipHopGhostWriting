will
was
signed
and
the
signature
by
herself
as
domestic
and
giving
the
address
as
stone
cottage
stoke
cheverell
and
grace
nurse
of
cottage
stoke
cheverell
kate
said
nothing
on
the
face
of
it
to
interest
robin
boyton
but
he
obviously
took
the
trouble
to
get
this
copy
suppose
the
book
had
better
be
read
how
quick
are
you
benton
pretty
quick
ma
am
it
not
particularly
long
then
you
better
start
it
in
the
car
and
ll
drive
we
ll
get
bag
from
and
get
this
stuff
to
the
old
police
cottage
don
suppose
there
anything
in
the
other
cupboard
to
interest
us
but
we
better
go
through
it
benton
said
even
if
we
find
that
he
has
more
than
one
friend
with
can
somehow
an
enemy
going
down
to
stoke
cheverell
to
kill
him
getting
access
to
the
westhalls
cottage
and
sticking
the
body
in
their
freezer
but
obviously
copy
of
the
will
must
mean
something
unless
he
just
wanted
to
confirm
that
the
old
man
had
left
him
nothing
wonder
why
it
was
hand
written
obviously
grace
isn
still
living
in
cottage
the
place
is
for
sale
but
why
was
boyton
trying
to
contact
her
and
what
happened
to
she
isn
working
for
the
westhalls
now
the
date
of
the
will
is
interesting
though
isn
it
kate
said
slowly
not
only
the
date
let
get
out
of
this
mess
the
sooner
we
get
this
to
ad
the
better
but
we
ve
been
told
to
see
miss
gradwyn
agent
ve
feeling
that
it
shouldn
take
long
remind
me
who
and
where
she
is
benton
ma
am
our
appointment
for
three
fifteen
the
office
is
in
damn
it
out
of
our
way
ll
check
with
ad
that
there
nothing
else
he
wants
done
in
london
while
we
re
here
there
usually
something
he
needs
picking
up
at
the
yard
then
we
ll
find
somewhere
for
quick
lunch
and
be
on
our
way
to
see
what
if
anything
has
to
tell
us
but
at
least
this
morning
hasn
been
wasted
with
their
car
in
london
traffic
the
journey
to
address
in
was
tedious
and
time
consuming
benton
hoped
that
the
information
gained
from
her
would
justify
the
time
and
trouble
taken
to
reach
her
her
office
was
over
shop
and
the
smell
of
fruit
and
vegetables
followed
them
as
they
climbed
the
narrow
stairs
to
the
first
floor
and
passed
into
what
was
obviously
the
general
office
three
young
women
were
seated
at
their
computers
while
an
elderly
man
was
busy
the
books
all
in
their
bright
on
shelf
which
ran
the
whole
length
of
one
wall
three
pairs
of
eyes
looked
up
and
when
kate
showed
her
card
one
young
woman
got
up
and
knocked
on
the
door
at
the
front
of
the
building
and
called
the
police
are
here
you
said
you
were
expecting
them
had
been
telephone
call
now
she
replaced
the
smiled
at
them
and
indicated
two
chairs
opposite
the
desk
she
was
large
handsome
woman
with
of
dark
hair
to
her
shoulders
plump
and
wearing
bright
with
she
said
you
re
here
of
course
to
talk
about
rhoda
gradwyn
all
ve
been
told
is
that
you
re
investigating
what
was
described
as
suspicious
death
which
take
to
mean
murder
if
so
it
deeply
shocking
but
not
sure
there
anything
can
tell
you
which
will
help
she
came
to
me
twenty
years
ago
when
first
split
from
the
and
set
up
on
my
own
and
she
been
with
me
ever
since
kate
asked
how
well
did
you
know
her
as
suppose
very
well
that
means
could
identify
any
piece
of
as
being
by
her
knew
how
she
liked
to
deal
with
her
and
could
what
her
response
would
be
to
any
put
forward
respected
her
and
liked
her
and
was
glad
to
have
her
on
my
list
we
together
once
every
six
months
usually
to
discuss
concerns
beyond
that
can
say
knew
her
kate
said
she
been
described
to
us
as
very
private
person
yes
she
was
thinking
about
her
as
of
course
have
been
since
got
the
news
it
seems
that
she
was
like
someone
with
secret
which
she
needed
to
keep
and
which
inhibited
her
from
intimacy
knew
her
little
better
after
twenty
years
than
did
when
she
first
came
to
me
benton
who
had
been
taking
interest
in
the
of
the
office
particularly
the
photographs
of
ranged
on
one
wall
said
isn
that
unusual
between
an
agent
and
ve
always
imagined
that
the
relationship
must
be
particularly
close
to
not
necessarily
there
has
to
be
liking
and
trust
and
common
agreement
about
what
is
important
people
some
of
my
have
become
close
friends
number
need
very
high
degree
of
personal
involvement
one
can
be
required
to
be
mother
financial
marriage
occasionally
even
rhoda
needed
none
of
these
services
kate
said
and
as
far
as
you
know
she
had
no
enemies
she
was
an
investigative
journalist
there
were
number
of
people
she
may
have
she
never
suggested
to
me
that
she
ever
felt
in
any
physical
danger
from
them
none
as
far
as
know
threatened
physical
harm
one
or
two
threatened
legal
proceedings
but
my
advice
to
her
then
was
that
she
say
and
do
nothing
and
as
expected
no
one
had
to
law
rhoda
wasn
woman
to
write
anything
which
could
be
proved
to
be
or
kate
said
not
even
an
article
in
the
review
of
some
people
used
that
article
as
weapon
to
modern
generally
but
most
recognised
it
as
serious
piece
on
an
interesting
subject
rhoda
and
did
have
visit
from
one
of
the
people
candace
westhall
but
she
took
no
action
nor
could
she
the
which
her
were
expressed
in
language
and
their
truth
was
all
that
was
about
five
years
ago
benton
asked
did
you
know
that
miss
gradwyn
had
decided
to
have
her
scar
removed
no
she
didn
tell
me
we
never
spoke
of
her
scar
and
her
present
plans
was
she
to
make
change
of
career
afraid
can
discuss
that
in
any
case
nothing
was
settled
and
think
her
plans
were
still
being
formed
she
wouldn
wish
me
to
discuss
them
with
anyone
other
than
herself
when
she
was
alive
and
you
ll
understand
that
can
talk
about
them
now
can
you
that
they
can
have
no
possible
to
her
death
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
said
and
was
already
making
it
clear
that
she
had
work
to
do
leaving
the
office
kate
said
why
that
question
about
future
plans
just
that
wondered
if
she
was
thinking
perhaps
of
if
the
subject
were
someone
living
he
or
she
might
have
motive
for
stopping
it
before
gradwyn
even
got
started
possibly
but
unless
you
re
suggesting
this
person
managed
to
find
out
what
herself
didn
know
that
miss
gradwyn
would
be
at
the
manor
and
managed
to
persuade
the
victim
or
someone
else
to
let
him
in
whatever
miss
gradwyn
had
in
mind
for
her
future
isn
going
to
help
us
as
they
on
their
benton
said
rather
liked
her
then
when
you
write
your
first
novel
which
given
your
of
you
undoubtedly
will
you
ll
know
who
to
contact
benton
laughed
it
been
quite
day
ma
am
but
at
least
we
re
not
going
back
empty
handed
the
journey
back
to
dorset
proved
nightmare
it
took
them
over
an
hour
to
get
from
to
the
and
they
were
then
caught
in
the
of
cars
almost
to
leaving
london
at
the
end
of
the
working
day
after
the
slow
drew
to
because
had
broken
down
one
of
the
and
they
were
for
nearly
an
hour
before
the
road
was
cleared
as
kate
was
unwilling
after
that
to
stop
for
food
they
didn
arrive
at
wisteria
house
until
nine
clock
tired
and
hungry
kate
rang
the
old
police
cottage
and
dalgliesh
asked
them
to
come
along
as
soon
as
they
had
fed
the
meal
to
which
they
had
increasingly
looked
forward
was
eaten
in
hurry
and
mrs
shepherd
and
pudding
hadn
with
the
long
wait
it
was
half
past
ten
before
they
sat
down
with
dalgliesh
to
report
on
the
day
dalgliesh
said
so
you
ve
learnt
nothing
from
the
agent
other
than
what
we
already
know
that
rhoda
gradwyn
was
very
private
woman
obviously
that
in
death
as
she
did
in
life
let
look
at
what
you
ve
brought
back
from
we
ll
start
with
the
least
important
this
novel
you
ve
read
it
benton
it
quickly
in
the
car
sir
it
with
legal
which
didn
manage
to
grasp
lawyer
would
and
the
novel
was
written
by
judge
but
the
does
deal
with
attempt
to
the
time
of
death
can
see
that
it
could
have
given
boyton
his
idea
so
it
one
more
piece
of
evidence
to
confirm
that
boyton
did
indeed
come
to
stoke
cheverell
with
the
idea
of
money
from
the
westhalls
an
idea
which
according
to
candace
westhall
he
got
from
rhoda
gradwyn
who
told
him
about
the
novel
let
get
on
to
more
important
piece
of
information
what
told
you
about
boyton
change
of
mood
he
says
that
boyton
returned
home
after
his
first
visit
on
the
of
november
why
if
candace
westhall
had
promised
to
settle
could
it
be
because
his
suspicions
about
the
body
had
been
shown
to
be
nonsense
do
we
really
believe
that
candace
westhall
had
decided
to
him
along
while
planning
some
more
dramatic
exposure
would
any
sensible
woman
act
like
that
then
before
returning
here
on
thursday
last
when
rhoda
gradwyn
was
admitted
for
her
operation
says
that
boyton
mood
had
changed
that
he
was
excited
and
and
talking
about
the
prospect
of
money
he
his
text
message
miss
gradwyn
to
see
him
telling
her
that
the
matter
is
urgent
so
what
happened
between
his
first
and
second
visits
to
change
the
whole
situation
he
went
to
probate
office
and
copy
of
peregrine
westhall
will
why
and
why
then
he
must
have
known
that
he
wasn
isn
it
possible
that
when
candace
had
his
about
the
body
she
did
offer
him
financial
help
or
in
some
way
made
him
suspect
that
she
wanted
any
argument
about
her
father
will
to
end
kate
said
you
re
thinking
of
sir
it
possibility
it
time
to
take
look
at
the
will
dalgliesh
spread
out
the
will
and
they
studied
it
in
silence
he
said
the
whole
will
is
in
with
the
date
written
in
full
the
seventh
day
of
two
thousand
and
five
the
day
of
the
london
if
one
were
the
date
not
sensible
one
to
choose
most
people
remember
what
they
were
doing
on
as
we
remember
what
we
were
doing
on
let
assume
then
that
both
the
date
and
the
will
itself
are
in
professor
westhall
handwriting
the
writing
is
distinctive
and
at
such
length
would
almost
certainly
be
detected
but
what
about
the
three
today
telephoned
member
of
the
firm
of
professor
westhall
with
questions
about
the
will
one
an
elderly
with
long
service
at
the
manor
is
now
dead
the
other
is
grace
who
was
something
of
in
the
village
and
to
toronto
to
live
with
benton
said
boyton
last
thursday
and
to
discover
grace
address
in
toronto
by
calling
at
cottage
and
it
after
his
first
visit
that
candace
westhall
knew
that
however
ridiculous
his
first
suspicions
he
was
now
his
attention
on
the
will
it
was
mog
who
told
us
about
boyton
visit
to
cottage
did
he
also
pass
on
that
piece
of
gossip
to
candace
she
flies
to
toronto
to
give
miss
from
professor
westhall
something
that
could
easily
have
been
arranged
by
letter
telephone
or
and
why
wait
until
now
to
reward
her
for
her
services
and
why
was
it
so
important
to
see
grace
in
person
kate
said
if
we
re
thinking
of
it
strong
motive
all
right
suppose
minor
in
will
can
be
put
right
can
be
changed
if
all
the
consent
but
is
act
candace
westhall
couldn
risk
her
brother
reputation
as
well
as
his
but
if
grace
accepted
money
from
candace
westhall
in
return
for
her
silence
doubt
whether
anyone
will
get
the
truth
out
of
her
now
why
should
she
speak
perhaps
the
was
always
writing
wills
then
changing
his
mind
all
she
has
to
do
is
to
say
that
she
signed
several
wills
and
can
remember
specific
ones
she
helped
to
nurse
the
old
professor
those
years
couldn
have
been
easy
for
the
westhalls
she
probably
think
it
right
that
brother
and
sister
should
the
money
she
looked
at
dalgliesh
do
we
know
sir
what
the
previous
will
did
ask
that
when
spoke
to
the
the
whole
estate
was
divided
into
two
robin
boyton
was
to
receive
half
in
recognition
that
his
parents
and
he
had
been
treated
by
the
family
the
remaining
half
to
be
divided
equally
between
marcus
and
candace
and
he
knew
that
sir
very
much
doubt
it
hope
to
learn
more
on
friday
ve
made
an
appointment
with
the
lawyer
who
dealt
with
both
that
will
and
the
most
recent
he
sick
man
and
lives
in
retirement
nursing
home
outside
bournemouth
but
he
agreed
to
see
me
kate
said
it
strong
motive
sir
are
you
thinking
of
her
no
kate
tomorrow
propose
to
question
her
under
and
the
interview
will
be
even
so
this
is
going
to
be
it
will
be
unwise
and
perhaps
even
to
reveal
these
new
suspicions
without
more
evidence
than
we
have
there
only
statement
that
boyton
was
depressed
after
his
first
visit
and
before
the
next
and
his
text
message
to
rhoda
gradwyn
could
mean
anything
he
was
apparently
somewhat
young
man
well
we
saw
that
ourselves
benton
said
we
re
getting
somewhere
sir
but
without
one
piece
of
hard
physical
evidence
either
about
the
possible
or
the
deaths
of
rhoda
gradwyn
and
robin
boyton
and
to
matters
we
have
murderer
in
the
manor
we
won
get
further
tonight
and
we
re
all
tired
so
think
we
ll
call
it
day
it
was
just
before
midnight
but
dalgliesh
continued
to
feed
the
fire
it
would
be
useless
to
go
to
bed
while
his
brain
was
so
candace
westhall
had
the
opportunity
and
means
to
both
was
indeed
the
only
person
who
could
boyton
into
the
old
when
she
could
be
sure
of
being
alone
she
had
the
necessary
strength
to
force
him
into
the
freezer
she
had
that
her
on
the
lid
could
be
explained
and
she
had
made
certain
that
someone
was
with
her
when
the
body
was
found
and
had
remained
with
her
until
the
police
arrived
but
none
of
this
amounted
to
more
than
evidence
and
she
was
intelligent
enough
to
know
this
he
could
do
no
more
at
present
than
question
her
under
it
was
then
that
an
idea
came
into
his
mind
and
he
acted
on
it
before
second
thought
could
question
its
wisdom
was
apparently
late
in
his
local
his
mobile
might
still
be
switched
on
if
not
he
would
try
again
in
the
morning
was
in
the
pub
the
background
noise
made
speech
impossible
and
when
he
knew
it
was
dalgliesh
who
was
he
said
hold
on
minute
and
ll
go
outside
can
hear
you
properly
in
here
and
minute
later
is
there
any
news
dalgliesh
said
none
at
present
we
shall
be
in
touch
with
you
if
there
are
any
sorry
to
call
so
late
ringing
about
something
different
but
important
do
you
remember
what
you
were
doing
on
there
was
silence
then
asked
you
mean
the
day
of
the
london
yes
the
of
again
there
was
pause
in
which
dalgliesh
thought
was
the
temptation
to
ask
what
had
to
do
with
robin
death
then
he
said
who
doesn
it
like
and
the
day
died
one
robin
boyton
was
your
friend
at
that
time
wasn
he
do
you
recall
what
he
did
on
can
remember
what
he
told
me
he
did
he
was
in
central
london
he
turned
up
at
the
flat
where
was
living
then
just
before
eleven
at
night
and
bored
me
into
the
small
hours
with
the
of
his
narrow
escape
and
long
walk
to
he
been
in
court
road
close
to
the
that
blew
up
that
bus
he
was
clutched
by
some
old
who
was
pretty
shocked
and
had
to
spend
time
her
down
she
told
him
that
she
lived
in
stoke
cheverell
and
that
she
come
to
london
the
previous
day
to
stay
with
friend
to
do
some
shopping
she
planned
to
return
home
the
following
day
robin
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
get
stuck
with
her
but
he
managed
to
find
outside
gave
her
twenty
for
the
fare
and
she
went
off
calmly
enough
that
was
of
robin
he
said
he
rather
part
with
twenty
than
be
landed
with
the
old
dear
for
the
rest
of
the
day
did
he
tell
you
her
name
no
he
didn
don
know
the
name
of
the
lady
or
the
address
of
her
friend
or
for
that
matter
the
number
of
the
it
wasn
big
deal
but
it
happened
and
that
all
you
remember
mr
that
all
was
told
there
is
one
more
detail
think
he
did
mention
she
was
retired
who
was
helping
his
cousins
to
look
after
some
old
relative
they
been
landed
with
sorry
can
be
more
helpful
dalgliesh
him
and
snapped
shut
his
mobile
if
what
had
told
him
was
accurate
and
if
the
was
there
was
no
way
she
could
have
signed
the
will
on
but
was
she
she
could
have
been
any
village
woman
who
was
helping
at
stone
cottage
with
robin
boyton
help
they
might
have
her
but
boyton
was
dead
it
was
after
three
clock
dalgliesh
was
still
awake
and
restless
memory
of
was
and
now
that
both
boyton
and
were
dead
what
chance
was
there
of
the
friend
with
whom
she
had
stayed
or
the
that
had
taken
her
there
the
whole
of
his
theory
about
the
was
based
on
evidence
he
had
strong
dislike
of
making
an
arrest
which
was
not
followed
by
charge
of
murder
if
the
case
the
accused
was
left
under
of
suspicion
and
the
investigating
officer
could
get
reputation
for
unwise
and
premature
action
was
this
going
to
be
one
of
those
deeply
cases
and
they
were
not
rare
when
the
of
killer
was
known
but
the
evidence
inadequate
to
make
an
arrest
at
last
that
he
had
no
hope
of
sleep
he
got
out
of
bed
pulled
on
trousers
and
thick
and
wound
scarf
round
his
neck
perhaps
walk
down
the
lane
would
him
to
make
it
going
back
to
bed
at
midnight
there
had
been
brief
but
heavy
shower
and
the
air
was
sweet
smelling
and
fresh
but
not
bitterly
cold
he
strode
out
under
sky
with
high
stars
hearing
nothing
but
his
own
footsteps
then
he
felt
like
the
breath
of
the
rising
wind
the
night
became
alive
as
it
through
the
and
set
the
high
of
the
trees
only
to
die
after
the
brief
as
quickly
as
it
had
and
then
approaching
the
manor
he
saw
distant
of
flame
who
would
be
making
at
three
in
the
morning
something
was
burning
in
the
circle
of
stones
taking
his
mobile
from
his
pocket
he
called
for
kate
and
benton
as
he
heart
pounding
towards
the
fire
she
didn
set
the
alarm
clock
for
two
thirty
afraid
that
however
quickly
she
its
someone
would
hear
it
and
be
roused
from
sleep
but
she
didn
need
an
alarm
for
years
she
had
been
able
to
wake
by
act
of
will
just
as
she
could
sleep
so
that
her
breathing
became
and
she
herself
hardly
knew
whether
she
was
awake
or
asleep
two
thirty
was
good
time
midnight
was
the
hour
the
hour
of
mystery
and
secret
but
the
world
no
longer
slept
at
midnight
if
mr
chandler
powell
were
restless
he
might
well
walk
into
the
night
at
twelve
but
he
wouldn
be
at
two
thirty
and
nor
would
the
mary
burning
had
been
at
three
in
the
afternoon
on
december
but
the
afternoon
wasn
possible
for
her
act
of
the
final
of
which
would
silence
mary
troubled
voice
for
ever
and
give
her
peace
three
clock
in
the
morning
would
have
to
do
and
mary
would
understand
what
was
important
was
to
pay
this
final
to
re
as
closely
as
she
dared
those
appalling
final
minutes
december
the
was
both
the
right
day
and
perhaps
her
last
chance
it
might
well
be
that
mrs
would
call
for
her
tomorrow
she
was
ready
to
go
tired
of
being
ordered
about
as
if
she
were
the
least
important
person
at
the
manor
when
if
they
knew
she
was
the
most
powerful
but
soon
all
would
be
over
she
would
be
rich
and
people
would
be
paid
to
look
after
her
but
first
there
was
this
final
goodbye
to
be
said
the
last
time
she
would
speak
to
mary
it
was
as
well
that
she
had
made
her
plans
so
far
in
advance
following
on
robin
boyton
death
the
two
cottages
had
been
by
the
police
it
would
be
even
to
visit
the
cottages
after
dark
and
impossible
at
any
time
to
leave
the
manor
without
the
security
team
seeing
her
but
she
had
acted
as
soon
as
miss
cressett
told
her
that
guest
would
be
arriving
at
rose
cottage
on
the
same
day
as
miss
gradwyn
had
been
booked
in
for
her
surgery
it
was
her
job
to
or
wash
the
dust
and
polish
and
make
up
the
bed
before
guest
arrived
everything
had
come
together
everything
had
been
meant
she
even
had
the
on
to
hold
the
clean
linen
and
to
bring
back
the
bed
linen
and
for
washing
the
soap
for
the
shower
and
and
the
plastic
bag
with
her
cleaning
she
could
use
the
to
bring
back
two
of
the
bags
of
from
the
rose
cottage
shed
length
of
old
washing
line
which
had
been
dumped
there
and
two
of
wrapped
in
the
old
newspapers
which
she
always
carried
to
spread
over
newly
washed
even
safely
carried
smelled
but
where
could
she
hide
them
in
the
manor
she
decided
to
put
the
in
two
plastic
bags
and
after
dark
to
them
away
under
the
leaves
and
of
the
by
the
hedge
the
was
deep
enough
to
prevent
the
being
seen
and
the
plastic
would
keep
the
dry
the
and
she
could
safely
lock
away
in
her
one
large
suitcase
under
her
bed
no
one
would
find
them
there
she
was
responsible
for
cleaning
her
own
room
and
making
her
own
bed
and
everyone
at
the
manor
was
about
privacy
when
her
watch
showed
two
forty
she
was
ready
to
leave
she
put
on
her
coat
large
box
of
matches
already
in
the
pocket
and
tied
scarf
over
her
head
opening
the
door
slowly
she
stood
for
moment
hardly
daring
to
breathe
the
house
was
silent
now
that
there
was
no
risk
of
one
of
the
security
team
at
night
she
could
move
without
fear
that
watchful
eyes
and
keen
ears
were
on
the
alert
only
the
bostocks
slept
in
the
central
of
the
manor
and
she
had
no
need
to
pass
their
door
carrying
the
bags
of
and
the
curled
washing
line
over
her
shoulder
she
moved
quietly
step
by
careful
step
along
the
corridor
down
the
side
stairs
to
the
ground
floor
to
the
west
door
as
before
she
had
to
stand
on
to
ease
back
the
bolt
and
took
her
time
careful
that
no
of
metal
should
the
silence
then
carefully
she
turned
the
key
went
out
into
the
night
and
locked
the
door
behind
her
it
was
cold
night
the
stars
high
the
air
and
few
moved
over
the
bright
of
the
moon
and
now
the
wind
was
rising
not
steadily
but
in
short
like
an
breath
she
moved
like
ghost
down
the
lime
walk
from
trunk
to
trunk
but
she
had
no
real
fear
of
being
seen
the
west
wing
was
in
darkness
and
no
other
windows
overlooked
the
lime
walk
as
she
reached
the
stone
wall
and
the
moon
stones
were
fully
in
sight
of
wind
along
the
dark
setting
the
bare
and
the
long
beyond
the
circle
whispering
and
she
was
sorry
that
the
wind
was
so
erratic
she
knew
that
it
would
help
the
fire
but
its
very
would
be
dangerous
this
was
to
be
memorial
not
second
sacrifice
she
must
take
care
that
the
fire
never
got
too
close
she
sucked
finger
and
held
it
up
trying
to
decide
the
way
the
wind
was
blowing
then
moved
among
the
stones
as
quietly
as
if
she
feared
that
someone
was
behind
them
and
set
the
bags
of
beside
the
central
stone
then
she
made
her
way
to
the
it
took
few
minutes
to
find
the
plastic
bags
with
the
for
some
reason
she
thought
she
had
left
them
closer
to
the
stones
and
the
travelling
moon
the
brief
of
light
and
dark
was
she
crept
along
the
crouching
low
but
her
hands
only
and
and
the
cold
of
the
at
last
she
found
what
she
sought
and
carried
the
over
to
the
she
should
have
brought
knife
the
first
bag
was
than
she
had
expected
and
it
took
few
minutes
of
her
before
it
burst
open
and
the
wood
out
and
now
she
began
to
circle
of
wood
inside
the
stones
it
couldn
be
too
or
the
ring
of
fire
would
be
or
too
near
in
case
it
caught
her
bending
and
working
she
at
last
completed
the
circle
to
her
satisfaction
then
the
cap
and
holding
the
first
can
with
great
care
she
bent
double
and
made
her
way
around
the
circle
of
each
stick
she
found
she
had
poured
the
too
and
with
the
second
can
was
more
careful
anxious
to
start
the
fire
and
satisfied
that
the
were
well
she
used
only
half
the
taking
the
washing
line
she
bound
herself
to
the
central
stone
this
was
than
she
had
expected
but
at
last
she
discovered
that
the
best
plan
was
to
circle
the
stone
twice
with
the
then
step
into
it
raise
it
along
her
body
and
it
it
helped
that
the
centre
stone
her
was
taller
but
and
than
the
others
this
done
she
tied
the
at
the
front
of
her
waist
letting
the
long
taking
the
matches
from
her
pocket
she
stood
rigid
for
moment
her
eyes
closed
the
wind
and
then
was
calm
she
said
to
mary
this
is
for
you
this
is
in
memory
of
you
this
is
to
tell
you
know
you
were
innocent
they
re
taking
me
away
from
you
this
is
the
last
time
can
visit
you
speak
to
me
but
tonight
there
was
no
answering
voice
she
struck
match
and
threw
it
towards
the
circle
of
wood
but
the
wind
blew
out
the
flame
almost
as
soon
as
it
had
been
lit
she
tried
again
and
again
with
shaking
hands
she
was
close
to
sobbing
it
wasn
going
to
work
she
would
have
to
get
closer
to
the
circle
and
then
run
back
to
the
stone
and
tie
herself
again
but
suppose
the
fire
didn
take
even
then
and
as
she
stared
up
the
avenue
the
great
of
the
and
closed
in
together
their
top
and
the
moon
the
path
to
and
the
west
wing
which
had
been
dark
distant
shape
dissolved
into
the
greater
darkness
and
now
she
could
hear
the
crowd
of
arriving
they
were
down
the
lime
walk
their
distant
voices
rising
to
shout
which
pounded
at
her
ears
the
witch
the
witch
she
killed
our
she
our
she
murdered
her
her
and
now
they
were
at
the
wall
but
they
didn
climb
over
they
against
it
the
crowd
growing
mouths
like
row
of
death
heads
screaming
hatred
at
her
and
suddenly
the
shouting
stopped
figure
detached
itself
came
over
the
wall
and
moved
up
to
her
voice
she
knew
said
gently
and
with
note
of
how
could
you
think
would
let
you
do
this
alone
knew
you
wouldn
fail
her
it
won
work
the
way
you
re
doing
it
ll
help
ve
come
as
the
she
hadn
planned
it
like
this
it
was
to
be
her
act
and
hers
alone
but
perhaps
it
would
be
good
to
have
witness
and
after
all
this
was
special
witness
this
was
the
one
who
understood
the
one
she
could
trust
now
she
had
someone
else
secret
one
which
gave
her
power
and
would
make
her
rich
perhaps
it
was
right
that
they
should
be
together
the
selected
brought
it
over
and
it
from
the
wind
lit
it
and
held
it
high
then
moving
over
to
the
circle
thrust
it
among
the
immediately
there
was
rush
of
flame
and
the
fire
ran
like
living
and
sending
out
the
night
came
alive
and
now
the
voices
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
rose
in
and
she
experienced
moment
of
extraordinary
triumph
as
if
the
past
hers
and
mary
were
burning
away
the
moved
closer
to
her
why
she
wondered
were
the
hands
so
pale
so
why
the
surgical
gloves
and
then
the
hands
took
hold
of
the
end
of
the
washing
line
and
with
one
swift
movement
curled
it
round
her
neck
there
was
vicious
as
it
tightened
she
felt
cold
on
her
face
something
was
being
thrown
over
her
body
the
of
intensified
its
her
the
breath
was
hot
on
her
face
and
the
eyes
which
looked
into
hers
were
like
the
seemed
to
grow
so
that
there
was
no
face
nothing
but
dark
in
which
she
saw
only
reflection
of
her
own
despair
she
tried
to
cry
out
but
she
had
no
breath
no
voice
she
fumbled
at
the
which
bound
her
but
her
hands
had
no
strength
barely
conscious
she
slumped
against
the
and
waited
for
death
mary
death
and
then
she
heard
what
sounded
like
sob
followed
by
great
cry
it
couldn
be
her
voice
she
had
no
voice
and
then
the
can
of
was
lifted
and
flung
towards
the
hedge
she
saw
an
of
fire
and
the
hedge
into
flame
and
now
she
was
alone
half
she
began
pulling
at
the
round
her
neck
but
there
was
no
strength
to
lift
her
arms
the
crowd
had
gone
now
the
fire
was
beginning
to
die
she
slumped
against
her
her
legs
and
knew
nothing
more
suddenly
there
were
voices
blaze
of
her
eyes
someone
was
over
the
stone
wall
running
to
get
her
over
the
dying
fire
there
were
arms
round
her
man
arms
and
she
heard
his
voice
you
re
all
right
you
re
safe
sharon
can
you
understand
me
you
re
safe
they
had
heard
the
sound
of
the
car
even
before
they
reached
the
stones
there
was
no
point
in
making
desperate
to
follow
sharon
had
been
the
top
now
dalgliesh
said
to

miss
westhall
the
four
security
men
by
the
flames
were
with
the
blazing
hedge
which
by
the
earlier
rain
was
quickly
subdued
into
and
smoke
now
low
slid
from
the
face
of
the
moon
and
the
night
became
the
stones
in
the
moon
light
shone
like
and
the
figures
which
dalgliesh
knew
were
helena
lettie
and
the
bostocks
became
shapes
into
the
darkness
he
watched
while
chandler
powell
in
his
long
dressing
gown
with
flavia
at
his
side
carried
sharon
over
the
wall
and
then
they
too
disappeared
into
the
lime
walk
he
was
aware
of
someone
who
remained
and
now
suddenly
in
the
marcus
westhall
face
seemed
image
the
face
of
dead
man
moving
up
to
him
dalgliesh
said

benton
had
pulled
on
trousers
and
had
struggled
into
thick
as
he
ran
towards
the
fire
now
dalgliesh
called
out
to
him

benton
was
off
running
strongly
but
now
marcus
had
found
his
voice
he
after
dalgliesh
as
an
old
man
shouting
coming
with

wait
for
me
wait
for
me
there
no
point
in
the
end
she
will
be
found
have
to
come
need
to
be
there
when
you
find
her
dalgliesh
wasted
no
time
in
argument
marcus
westhall
had
right
to
be
with
them
and
could
be
helpful
in
the
right
stretch
of
beach
he
said
get
warm
coat
but
hurry
his
car
was
the
but
speed
was
hardly
important
nor
was
it
possible
on
the
country
road
it
could
be
too
late
now
to
get
to
the
sea
before
she
walked
to
her
death
if
was
what
she
had
in
mind
it
was
impossible
to
know
if
her
brother
was
speaking
the
truth
but
remembering
his
face
dalgliesh
thought
that
he
probably
was
benton
took
only
minutes
fetching
the
from
the
old
police
cottage
and
was
waiting
as
dalgliesh
and
westhall
reached
the
road
without
speaking
he
opened
the
back
door
for
westhall
to
get
in
then
followed
him
apparently
this
passenger
was
too
to
be
left
alone
in
the
back
of
car
benton
took
out
his
torch
and
gave
directions
for
their
route
the
smell
of
from
dalgliesh
clothes
and
hands
filled
the
car
he
lowered
the
window
and
the
night
air
cold
and
sweet
filled
his
lungs
the
narrow
country
rising
and
falling
before
them
on
either
side
dorset
stretched
away
its
and
hills
the
small
the
stone
cottages
there
was
little
traffic
in
this
the
dead
of
night
all
the
houses
were
in
darkness
and
now
he
could
smell
change
in
the
air
which
was
more
sensation
than
smell
but
to
him
unmistakable
the
of
the
sea
the
lane
as
they
descended
through
the
silent
village
and
then
on
to
the
at
bay
before
them
the
sea
under
the
stars
and
the
moon
whenever
dalgliesh
was
in
reach
of
the
sea
he
felt
himself
drawn
to
it
like
an
animal
to
pool
of
water
here
down
the
since
man
first
stood
upright
on
its
caught
at
so
many
emotions
not
least
as
now
the
awareness
of
the
of
human
life
they
moved
to
the
beach
under
the
blackness
of
the
rising
dark
as
and
at
its
with
grass
and
bushes
the
of
black
ran
out
to
sea
in
of
sea
the
waves
slid
over
them
their
in
the
they
like
polished
they
on
by
the
light
of
their
sweeping
them
over
the
beach
and
the
of
black
marcus
westhall
who
had
been
silent
on
the
journey
seemed
now
and
on
through
the
fringe
of
as
if
they
rounded
and
were
faced
by
another
narrow
beach
another
stretch
of
black
they
found
nothing
and
now
they
could
go
no
further
the
beach
ended
and
the
to
the
sea
their
way
dalgliesh
said
she
not
here
we
could
try
the
other
beach
westhall
voice
raised
against
the
of
the
sea
was
cry
she
doesn
there
it
here
she
come
she
out
there
somewhere
dalgliesh
said
calmly
we
ll
the
search
in
daylight
think
this
is
where
we
call
but
westhall
was
again
making
his
way
over
the
until
he
was
on
the
edge
of
the
breaking
tide
and
there
he
stood
against
the
glancing
at
each
other
dalgliesh
and
benton
carefully
over
the
tide
swept
towards
him
westhall
didn
turn
the
sea
under
mottled
sky
in
which
low
were
the
of
and
the
moon
looked
to
dalgliesh
like
an
of
dirty
with
which
drifted
into
the
in
the
like
the
tide
was
running
strongly
and
he
could
see
that
westhall
trousers
were
and
as
he
reached
his
side
sudden
full
wave
broke
over
the
legs
of
the
rigid
figure
nearly
knocking
them
both
from
the
dalgliesh
his
arm
him
he
said
quietly
come
away
now
she
isn
here
there
nothing
you
can
do
without
word
westhall
allowed
himself
to
be
helped
across
the
stretch
of
and
gently
urged
into
the
car
they
were
halfway
to
the
manor
when
the
it
was
dc
warren
we
ve
found
the
car
sir
she
didn
go
further
than
wood
less
than
half
mile
from
the
manor
we
re
searching
the
wood
now
was
the
car
open
no
sir
locked
and
there
no
sign
of
anything
inside
right
go
ahead
and
ll
join
you
it
was
not
search
to
which
he
looked
forward
as
she
had
parked
the
car
and
hadn
used
the
to
kill
herself
the
chances
were
that
this
was
hanging
hanging
had
always
horrified
him
and
not
only
because
it
had
been
for
so
long
the
of
however
carried
out
there
was
something
in
the
up
of
another
human
being
he
had
little
doubt
now
that
candace
westhall
had
killed
herself
but
please
god
not
that
way
without
turning
his
head
he
said
to
westhall
the
local
police
have
found
your
sister
car
she
isn
there
ll
take
you
back
to
the
manor
now
you
need
to
get
dry
and
changed
now
you
must
wait
there
absolutely
no
point
in
doing
anything
else
there
was
no
reply
but
when
the
gates
were
opened
for
them
and
they
drew
up
at
the
front
door
westhall
allowed
himself
to
be
led
in
by
benton
and
handed
over
to
the
waiting
lettie
frensham
he
followed
her
like
an
child
into
the
library
there
was
pile
of
and
before
fire
and
brandy
and
on
the
table
beside
chair
she
said
think
you
be
better
with
some
of
dean
soup
he
has
it
ready
but
now
take
off
your
jacket
and
trousers
and
these
round
you
ll
fetch
your
and
dressing
gown
he
said
they
re
somewhere
in
the
bedroom
ll
find
them
as
child
he
did
as
he
was
told
the
trousers
like
pile
of
before
the
flames
he
sank
back
into
the
chair
he
felt
like
man
coming
out
of
an
anaesthetic
surprised
to
find
that
he
could
move
himself
to
being
alive
that
he
could
into
because
that
way
the
pain
would
stop
but
he
must
have
slept
in
the
armchair
for
few
minutes
opening
his
eyes
he
saw
lettie
beside
him
she
helped
him
into
his
dressing
gown
and
soup
in
mug
appeared
before
him
hot
and
strong
and
he
found
that
he
could
drink
it
although
he
noticed
only
the
taste
of
after
time
during
which
she
sat
beside
him
in
silence
he
said
there
something
have
to
tell
you
shall
have
to
tell
dalgliesh
but
need
to
say
it
now
need
to
tell
you
he
looked
into
her
face
and
saw
the
tension
in
her
eyes
the
anxiety
over
what
she
might
be
about
to
hear
he
said
know
nothing
of
rhoda
gradwyn
or
robin
it
isn
that
but
lied
to
the
police
it
wasn
because
the
car
was
causing
problems
that
didn
stay
with
the
that
night
left
to
see
friend
he
has
flat
close
to
st
angela
hospital
where
he
works
wanted
to
break
the
news
that
was
going
to
africa
knew
it
would
distress
him
but
had
to
try
to
make
him
understand
she
said
quietly
and
did
he
no
not
really
that
up
as
do
everything
lettie
touched
his
hand
shouldn
worry
the
police
with
that
unless
you
need
to
or
they
ask
it
won
be
important
to
them
now
it
is
to
me
there
was
silence
then
he
said
please
leave
me
now
all
right
promise
all
right
need
to
be
alone
just
let
me
know
when
they
find
her
he
could
be
sure
that
lettie
was
the
one
woman
who
would
understand
his
need
to
be
left
in
peace
and
wouldn
argue
she
said
ll
turn
the
lights
low
she
placed
on
lie
back
and
put
your
feet
up
ll
be
back
in
an
hour
try
to
sleep
and
then
she
was
gone
but
he
had
no
intention
of
sleeping
sleep
had
to
be
fought
off
there
was
only
one
place
where
he
needed
to
be
if
he
was
to
stop
himself
from
going
mad
he
had
to
think
he
had
to
try
to
understand
he
had
to
accept
what
his
mind
told
him
was
true
he
had
to
be
where
he
found
greater
peace
and
wisdom
than
he
could
find
here
among
these
dead
books
and
the
empty
eyes
of
the
he
made
his
way
quietly
out
of
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
through
the
great
hall
now
in
darkness
and
to
the
back
of
the
house
past
the
kitchen
and
through
the
side
door
into
the
garden
he
neither
felt
the
strength
of
the
wind
nor
the
cold
he
passed
the
old
then
through
the
formal
garden
to
the
stone
as
he
approached
through
the
light
he
saw
that
there
was
dark
shape
on
the
stones
outside
the
door
something
had
been
something
which
shouldn
be
there
confused
he
down
and
touched
its
with
trembling
fingers
and
then
he
could
smell
it
and
raising
his
hands
saw
that
they
were
covered
with
blood
he
struggled
forward
on
his
knees
and
willing
himself
to
stand
managed
to
raise
the
the
door
was
bolted
and
then
he
knew
he
beat
against
it
sobbing
calling
her
name
until
his
strength
gave
out
and
he
sank
slowly
to
his
knees
his
red
pressed
against
the
wood
and
it
was
there
still
in
her
blood
that
the
found
him
twenty
minutes
later
both
kate
and
benton
had
been
on
duty
for
over
fourteen
hours
and
when
the
body
had
finally
been
removed
dalgliesh
had
ordered
them
to
rest
for
two
hours
eat
an
early
supper
and
join
him
in
the
old
police
cottage
at
eight
clock
neither
spent
those
two
hours
in
sleep
in
his
room
the
window
open
to
the
light
benton
lay
as
as
if
nerves
and
muscles
were
ready
at
any
moment
to
spring
into
action
the
hours
since
the
moment
when
answering
dalgliesh
call
they
had
first
glimpsed
the
fire
and
heard
sharon
seemed
an
in
which
the
of
waiting
for
the
pathologist
the
photographer
the
mortuary
van
were
with
moments
so
recalled
that
he
felt
they
were
being
clicked
onto
his
brain
like
on
screen
the
gentleness
of
chandler
powell
and
sister
holland
half
carrying
sharon
over
the
stone
wall
and
her
down
the
lime
avenue
marcus
standing
alone
on
the
of
black
looking
out
over
the
grey
sea
the
photographer
carefully
his
way
round
the
body
to
avoid
the
blood
the
crack
of
the
finger
as
dr
glenister
broke
them
one
by
one
and
forced
the
from
candace
grip
he
lay
there
of
tiredness
but
feeling
still
the
pain
of
his
upper
arm
and
shoulder
from
that
final
at
the
door
he
and
dalgliesh
together
had
strained
their
shoulders
against
the
oak
but
the
bolt
hadn
dalgliesh
had
said
we
re
getting
in
each
other
way
take
run
at
it
benton
he
had
taken
his
time
over
it
line
which
would
avoid
the
blood
walking
back
some
fifteen
yards
the
first
had
shaken
the
door
at
the
third
attempt
it
had
burst
open
against
the
body
then
he
had
stood
back
while
dalgliesh
and
kate
entered
first
she
had
been
lying
curled
like
sleeping
child
the
knife
beside
her
right
hand
there
was
only
one
cut
in
her
wrist
but
it
was
deep
like
an
open
mouth
in
her
left
hand
was
the
image
was
shattered
by
the
clatter
of
his
alarm
and
kate
loud
knock
on
the
door
he
into
action
within
minutes
both
of
them
were
dressed
and
downstairs
mrs
shepherd
placed
baked
and
on
the
table
and
herself
in
the
kitchen
it
wasn
meal
she
usually
served
but
she
seemed
to
know
that
what
they
was
hot
comfort
food
they
were
surprised
to
find
themselves
so
hungry
and
ate
mostly
in
silence
then
set
out
together
for
the
old
police
cottage
passing
the
manor
benton
saw
that
the
security
team
caravan
and
cars
were
no
longer
parked
outside
the
windows
with
light
as
if
for
celebration
it
was
not
word
any
of
the
household
would
have
used
but
benton
knew
that
great
weight
had
been
lifted
from
all
of
them
final
of
fear
suspicion
and
the
anxiety
that
the
truth
might
never
be
known
the
arrest
of
one
of
them
would
have
been
preferable
to
that
but
an
arrest
would
have
meant
the
the
prospect
of
national
trial
the
public
show
of
the
witness
box
the
followed
by
suicide
was
the
rational
and
they
would
be
able
to
tell
themselves
the
most
solution
for
candace
it
was
not
thought
they
would
voice
but
benton
when
he
returned
to
the
manor
with
marcus
had
seen
it
in
their
faces
now
they
would
be
able
to
wake
in
the
morning
without
the
descending
of
fear
of
what
that
day
might
bring
could
sleep
behind
unlocked
bedroom
doors
need
not
measure
their
words
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
they
would
see
the
end
of
the
police
presence
dalgliesh
and
his
team
would
have
to
return
to
dorset
for
the
inquest
but
there
was
nothing
left
for
the
team
to
do
now
at
the
manor
they
would
not
be
missed
three
of
the
suicide
had
been
made
and
and
the
original
was
in
the
of
the
dorset
police
to
be
as
an
at
the
inquest
now
they
would
listen
again
as
team
it
was
apparent
to
kate
that
dalgliesh
had
not
slept
the
fire
had
been
with
the
flames
and
as
usual
there
was
smell
of
burning
wood
and
freshly
made
coffee
but
no
wine
they
sat
at
the
table
and
he
placed
the
in
the
machine
and
turned
it
on
candace
westhall
voice
was
expected
but
it
was
so
clear
and
confident
that
for
moment
kate
could
believe
she
was
in
the
room
with
them
am
speaking
to
commander
adam
dalgliesh
in
the
knowledge
that
this
will
be
passed
on
to
the
coroner
and
anyone
else
with
interest
in
the
truth
what
am
speaking
now
is
the
truth
and
don
think
it
will
come
as
surprise
to
you
have
known
for
over
twenty
four
hours
that
you
were
going
to
arrest
me
my
plan
to
sharon
at
the
witch
stone
was
my
last
desperate
attempt
to
save
myself
from
trial
and
life
sentence
and
all
that
would
for
those
care
about
and
if
had
been
able
to
kill
sharon
would
have
been
safe
even
if
you
had
suspected
the
truth
her
burning
would
have
looked
like
the
suicide
of
and
murderer
suicide
which
hadn
arrived
in
time
to
prevent
and
how
could
you
have
me
with
gradwyn
murder
with
any
hope
of
conviction
while
sharon
with
her
history
was
among
the
suspects
oh
yes
knew
was
there
when
she
was
interviewed
for
job
at
the
manor
flavia
holland
was
with
me
but
she
early
saw
that
sharon
wouldn
be
suitable
for
any
work
with
the
patients
and
left
me
to
decide
whether
there
was
place
for
her
with
the
domestic
staff
and
we
were
desperately
short
at
the
time
we
needed
her
of
course
was
curious
twenty
five
year
old
woman
with
no
husband
no
lover
no
family
apparently
no
history
no
ambition
to
be
more
than
the
in
the
domestic
order
there
had
to
be
some
explanation
that
mixture
of
irritating
desire
to
please
with
silent
sense
that
she
was
at
home
in
an
institution
that
she
had
been
used
to
being
watched
that
she
was
in
some
way
under
there
was
only
one
crime
for
which
all
this
was
appropriate
in
the
end
knew
because
she
told
me
and
there
was
another
reason
why
she
had
to
die
she
saw
me
as
was
leaving
the
manor
after
had
killed
rhoda
gradwyn
and
now
she
who
had
always
had
secret
to
keep
knew
another
secret
could
sense
her
triumph
her
satisfaction
and
she
told
me
what
she
planned
to
do
at
the
stones
her
final
to
mary
memorial
and
farewell
why
wouldn
she
tell
me
we
had
both
killed
bound
together
by
that
terrible
crime
and
then
in
the
end
after
had
wound
the
round
her
neck
and
poured
over
her
couldn
the
match
realised
in
that
moment
what
had
become
there
little
to
tell
you
about
the
death
of
rhoda
gradwyn
the
simple
explanation
is
that
killed
her
to
the
death
of
dear
friend
but
simple
never
tell
the
whole
truth
did
go
to
her
room
that
night
with
the
intention
of
killing
her
had
after
all
done
all
could
to
chandler
powell
from
her
to
the
manor
afterwards
thought
not
that
meant
only
to
her
to
tell
her
the
truth
about
herself
to
let
her
know
that
she
had
destroyed
young
life
and
great
talent
and
that
if
about
four
pages
of
dialogue
and
description
the
rest
of
the
novel
was
and
hers
and
when
lifted
my
hand
from
her
neck
and
knew
that
there
would
be
no
between
us
ever
again
felt
release
which
was
as
much
physical
as
mental
it
seemed
by
this
one
act
had
washed
away
all
the
guilt
frustration
and
regret
of
the
past
years
in
one
moment
it
had
all
passed
away
and
still
feel
some
of
that
release
believe
now
that
went
to
her
bedroom
knowing
that
meant
to
kill
why
else
would
have
worn
those
surgical
gloves
which
later
cut
up
in
the
bathroom
of
one
of
the
empty
suites
it
was
in
that
suite
that
had
hidden
myself
leaving
the
manor
by
the
front
door
as
usual
re
entering
later
at
the
back
door
with
my
key
before
chandler
powell
locked
up
for
the
night
and
taking
the
lift
up
to
the
patients
floor
there
was
no
real
risk
of
discovery
who
would
think
of
searching
vacant
room
for
an
intruder
afterwards
went
down
by
the
lift
expecting
to
have
to
the
door
but
the
door
wasn
bolted
sharon
had
left
before
me
what
said
after
the
death
of
robin
boyton
was
essentially
true
he
had
devised
this
extraordinary
idea
that
we
had
concealed
my
father
time
of
death
by
his
body
doubt
that
this
was
his
idea
this
too
came
from
rhoda
gradwyn
and
they
planned
to
it
together
that
why
after
more
than
thirty
years
she
decided
to
have
the
scar
removed
and
chose
to
have
the
operation
here
that
why
robin
was
here
both
on
her
first
visit
and
when
she
came
for
the
operation
the
plan
was
of
course
ridiculous
but
there
were
facts
which
might
make
it
that
why
went
to
toronto
to
see
grace
who
was
with
my
father
when
he
died
and
had
second
reason
for
the
visit
to
pay
her
sum
in
of
the
felt
she
deserved
didn
tell
my
brother
what
gradwyn
and
robin
were
planning
had
sufficient
evidence
to
charge
them
both
with
if
that
what
they
intended
but
decided
to
play
along
until
robin
was
and
then
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
him
and
taking
my
asked
him
to
meet
me
in
the
old
the
lid
of
the
freezer
was
shut
asked
what
sort
of
he
proposed
and
he
said
that
he
had
moral
right
to
third
of
the
estate
if
that
were
paid
over
there
would
be
no
future
demand
pointed
out
that
he
could
hardly
that
the
date
of
death
without
himself
being
accused
of
he
admitted
that
we
were
in
each
other
power
offered
one
quarter
of
the
estate
with
five
thousand
as
start
said
it
was
in
cash
in
the
freezer
needed
his
on
the
lid
and
knew
that
he
was
too
to
resist
he
might
have
doubted
but
he
had
to
look
we
moved
over
to
the
freezer
and
when
he
lifted
the
lid
suddenly
him
by
the
legs
and
him
in
with
strong
shoulders
and
arms
and
he
wasn
heavy
man
closed
the
lid
and
the
felt
an
extraordinary
exhaustion
and
was
breathing
hard
but
couldn
have
been
tired
it
was
as
easy
as
child
could
hear
the
sounds
from
inside
the
freezer
muffled
stood
there
for
few
minutes
leaning
on
the
freezer
listening
to
his
then
went
next
door
and
made
pot
of
tea
the
sounds
and
when
they
stopped
went
into
the
to
let
him
out
he
was
dead
meant
only
to
him
but
think
now
trying
to
be
totally
honest
and
which
of
us
can
ever
be
that
that
was
glad
to
find
that
he
was
dead
can
feel
sorry
for
either
of
my
victims
rhoda
gradwyn
genuine
talent
and
caused
hurt
and
distress
to
vulnerable
people
and
robin
boyton
was
an
doubt
whether
either
of
them
will
be
or
missed
that
all
have
to
say
except
to
make
it
plain
that
at
all
times
worked
entirely
alone
told
no
one
no
one
asked
for
no
one
help
involved
no
one
else
either
in
the
or
in
my
lies
shall
die
with
no
and
with
no
fear
shall
leave
this
where
can
be
confident
that
it
will
be
found
sharon
will
tell
her
story
and
you
already
suspected
the
truth
hope
that
all
goes
well
with
her
for
myself
have
no
hope
and
no
fear
dalgliesh
clicked
off
the
player
the
three
of
them
leaned
back
and
kate
found
that
she
was
breathing
deeply
as
if
from
some
ordeal
then
without
speaking
dalgliesh
brought
the
to
the
table
and
taking
it
benton
filled
the
three
cups
and
pushed
forward
the
milk
and
sugar
dalgliesh
said
given
what
told
me
last
night
how
much
of
that
do
we
believe
after
moment
thought
it
was
kate
who
answered
we
know
she
killed
miss
gradwyn
one
fact
alone
that
no
one
at
the
manor
was
told
that
we
had
evidence
that
the
gloves
were
cut
up
and
flushed
down
the
lavatory
and
that
death
wasn
you
don
go
to
the
victim
wearing
gloves
if
your
object
is
only
to
then
there
the
attack
on
sharon
that
wasn
she
was
to
kill
dalgliesh
said
was
she
wonder
she
killed
both
rhoda
gradwyn
and
robin
boyton
and
she
has
given
us
her
motive
the
question
is
whether
the
coroner
and
the
if
he
