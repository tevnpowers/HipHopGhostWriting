if
he
hadn
spoken
in
eight
years
we
ve
never
had
holiday
together
in
this
country
or
how
often
have
we
been
to
show
in
restaurant
except
one
where
there
ll
be
no
risk
of
meeting
someone
you
know
want
these
ordinary
things
that
other
people
enjoy
he
said
again
and
with
some
sorry
obviously
ve
been
and
think
in
time
you
ll
be
able
to
look
back
on
these
eight
years
more
and
it
isn
too
late
you
re
very
attractive
and
you
re
still
young
it
sensible
to
when
stage
of
life
has
come
to
an
end
when
it
time
to
move
on
and
now
even
in
the
darkness
he
thought
he
could
see
her
contempt
you
mean
to
throw
me
over
not
that
to
move
on
isn
that
what
you
ve
been
saying
what
this
talk
is
all
about
and
you
won
marry
me
you
won
change
your
mind
no
flavia
won
change
my
mind
she
said
it
the
manor

it
it
isn
another
woman
who
come
between

this
house

ve
never
made
love
to
me
here
ever

you
you
don
want

wife
flavia
that
ridiculous
not

for
if
you

london
in
the
flat
we
wouldn
be
having
this
conversation
we
could
be
happy
there
but
here
at
the
manor
don
belong
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
everything
about
this
place
is
against
me
and
don
think
that
the
people
here
don
know
that
we
re
lovers
helena
lettie
the
bostocks
even
mog
they
re
probably
wondering
when

if

have
to
the
humiliation
of
their
pity
asking
you
again

marry
me
no
flavia
sorry
but
won
we
wouldn
be
happy
and
not
going
to
risk
second
failure
you
have
to
accept
that
this
is
the
end
and
suddenly
to
his
horror
she
was
crying
she
his
jacket
and
leaned
against
him
and
he
could
hear
the
great
sobs
feel
the
of
her
body
against
him
the
soft
wool
of
her
scarf
his
cheek
sense
the
familiar
smell
of
her
of
her
breath
taking
her
by
the
shoulders
he
said
flavia
don
cry
this
is
setting
you
free
she
drew
apart
making
pathetic
attempt
at
dignity
her
sobs
she
said
it
ll
look
odd
if
suddenly
and
there

skeffington

be
operated

it

the
first
and
last
time
promise
come
late
about
eleven
it
can
end
like
this
and
now
he
was
desperate
to
get
rid
of
her
he
said
of
course
ll
come
she
murmured
thank
you
and
turning
began
walking
quickly
back
towards
the
house
from
time
to
time
she
half
and
he
had
to
resist
the
urge
to
catch
her
up
to
find
some
final
word
which
could
her
but
there
was
none
he
knew
that
already
he
was
turning
his
mind
to
find
replacement
as
theatre
sister
he
knew
too
that
he
had
been
into
promise
but
it
was
one
he
had
to
keep
he
waited
until
her
figure
became
faint
then
into
the
darkness
and
still
he
waited
looking
up
at
the
west
wing
he
saw
the
faint
of
two
lights
one
in
mrs
skeffington
room
one
next
door
in
rhoda
gradwyn
so
her
bedside
lamp
must
be
on
and
she
was
not
yet
settled
for
sleep
he
thought
back
to
that
night
just
over
two
weeks
ago
when
he
had
sat
on
the
stones
and
watched
her
face
at
the
window
he
wondered
what
it
was
about
this
particular
patient
that
had
so
caught
his
imagination
perhaps
it
was
that
still
response
when
in
his
street
consulting
room
he
had
asked
her
why
she
had
waited
so
long
to
get
rid
of
her
scar
because
no
longer
have
need
of
it
four
hours
earlier
rhoda
gradwyn
had
slowly
drifted
back
to
consciousness
the
first
object
she
saw
on
opening
her
eyes
was
small
circle
it
hung
in
air
immediately
in
front
of
her
like
full
moon
her
mind
puzzled
but
tried
to
make
sense
of
it
it
couldn
she
thought
be
the
moon
it
was
too
solid
and
and
then
the
circle
became
clear
and
she
saw
that
it
was
wall
clock
with
wooden
frame
and
narrow
inner
of
although
the
hands
and
were
becoming
she
couldn
read
the
time
deciding
that
it
didn
matter
she
quickly
gave
up
the
attempt
she
became
aware
that
she
was
lying
on
bed
in
an
unfamiliar
room
and
that
other
people
were
with
her
moving
like
pale
shadows
on
silent
feet
and
then
she
remembered
she
was
to
have
her
scar
removed
and
they
must
have
prepared
her
for
the
operation
she
wondered
when
it
would
take
place
and
then
she
became
aware
that
something
had
happened
to
the
left
side
of
her
face
she
felt
and
an
like
thick
it
was
partly
the
edge
of
her
mouth
and
dragging
at
the
corner
of
her
left
eye
she
raised
her
hand
uncertain
whether
she
had
the
power
to
move
and
carefully
touched
her
face
the
left
cheek
was
no
longer
there
her
fingers
found
only
solid
mass
little
rough
to
the
touch
and
criss
crossed
with
something
that
felt
like
someone
was
gently
lowering
her
arm
familiar
voice
said
shouldn
touch
the
dressing
for
time
and
then
she
knew
that
she
was
in
the
recovery
room
and
the
two
figures
taking
shape
by
her
bed
must
be
mr
chandler
powell
and
sister
holland
she
looked
up
and
tried
to
form
words
from
her
mouth
how
did
it
go
are
you
pleased
the
words
were
but
mr
chandler
powell
seemed
to
understand
she
heard
his
voice
calm
authoritative
very
well
hope
that
in
little
time
you
will
be
pleased
too
now
you
must
rest
here
for
while
and
then
sister
will
wheel
you
up
to
your
room
she
lay
as
objects
round
her
how
many
hours
she
wondered
had
the
operation
taken
one
hour
two
three
however
long
time
had
been
lost
to
her
in
of
death
it
must
be
as
like
death
as
any
human
imagining
could
be
total
of
time
she
the
difference
between
this
temporary
death
and
sleep
to
wake
after
sleeping
even
deep
sleep
was
always
to
be
aware
that
time
had
passed
the
mind
at
the
of
waking
dreams
before
they
faded
beyond
recall
she
tried
to
test
memory
by
the
previous
day
she
was
sitting
in
rain
car
then
arriving
at
the
manor
entering
the
great
hall
for
the
first
time
in
her
room
talking
to
sharon
but
that
surely
had
all
been
on
her
first
visit
over
two
weeks
ago
the
recent
past
began
to
come
back
yesterday
had
been
different
pleasant
drive
the
winter
sunlight
with
brief
and
sudden
and
this
time
she
had
brought
with
her
to
the
manor
some
patiently
acquired
knowledge
which
she
could
make
use
of
or
could
let
go
now
in
she
thought
she
would
let
it
go
as
she
was
letting
go
of
her
own
past
it
couldn
be
none
of
it
could
be
changed
it
had
done
its
worst
but
its
power
would
soon
be
over
closing
her
eyes
and
into
sleep
she
thought
of
the
night
ahead
and
of
the
morning
which
she
would
never
live
to
see
seven
hours
later
back
in
her
bedroom
rhoda
into
she
lay
for
few
seconds
motionless
in
that
brief
confusion
which
the
sudden
from
sleep
she
was
aware
of
the
comfort
of
the
bed
and
the
weight
of
her
head
against
the
raised
of
the
smell
of
the
air
different
from
that
in
her
london
bedroom
fresh
but
more
than
smell
of
earth
and
grass
borne
to
her
on
the
erratic
wind
the
darkness
was
absolute
before
finally
sister
holland
advice
that
she
should
settle
herself
for
the
night
she
had
asked
for
the
curtains
to
be
pulled
back
and
the
window
slightly
opened
even
in
winter
she
disliked
sleeping
without
fresh
air
but
perhaps
it
had
been
unwise
gazing
at
the
window
she
could
see
that
the
room
was
darker
than
the
night
outside
and
that
high
were
the
sky
the
wind
was
more
strongly
and
she
could
hear
its
in
the
and
feel
its
breath
on
her
right
cheek
perhaps
she
should
stir
herself
from
this
and
get
up
to
close
the
window
the
effort
seemed
beyond
her
she
had
the
offer
of
sedative
and
found
it
strange
but
not
that
she
should
feel
this
this
urge
to
stay
where
she
was
in
warmth
and
comfort
awaiting
the
soft
of
the
next
of
wind
her
eyes
fixed
on
that
narrow
of
she
felt
no
pain
and
putting
up
her
left
hand
gently
touched
the
dressing
and
the
which
secured
it
she
was
used
now
to
the
weight
and
of
the
dressing
and
would
find
herself
touching
it
with
something
like
as
if
it
were
becoming
as
much
part
of
her
as
the
imagined
wound
which
it
covered
and
now
in
in
the
wind
she
heard
sound
so
faint
that
only
the
stillness
of
the
room
could
have
made
it
she
sensed
rather
than
heard
presence
moving
round
the
sitting
room
at
first
in
her
half
consciousness
she
felt
no
fear
only
vague
curiosity
it
must
be
early
morning
perhaps
it
was
seven
clock
and
the
arrival
of
her
tea
and
now
there
was
another
sound
no
more
than
gentle
but
unmistakable
someone
was
closing
the
bedroom
door
curiosity
gave
way
to
the
first
cold
of
unease
no
one
spoke
no
light
was
turned
on
she
tried
to
call
out
in
cracked
voice
made
by
the
dressing
who
are
you
what
are
you
doing
who
is
it
there
was
no
reply
and
now
she
knew
with
that
this
was
no
friendly
visitor
that
she
was
in
the
presence
of
someone
or
something
whose
purpose
was
as
she
lay
rigid
the
pale
figure
white
and
was
at
her
bedside
arms
moved
above
her
head
in
ritual
gesture
like
an
of
with
an
effort
she
tried
to
struggle
up
the
seemed
suddenly
to
her
down
and
stretched
out
hand
for
the
bell
pull
and
the
lamp
the
bell
pull
wasn
there
her
hand
found
the
light
and
clicked
it
on
but
there
was
no
light
someone
must
have
the
bell
pull
out
of
reach
and
taken
the
from
the
lamp
she
didn
cry
out
all
those
early
years
of
self
control
against
fear
against
finding
relief
in
shouting
and
had
inhibited
her
power
to
scream
and
she
knew
screaming
would
be
the
dressing
made
even
speech
difficult
she
struggled
to
get
out
of
bed
but
found
herself
unable
to
move
in
the
darkness
she
could
vaguely
make
out
the
of
the
figure
the
covered
head
the
face
hand
was
passing
across
the
of
the
half
open
window
but
it
was
not
human
hand
no
blood
had
ever
flowed
in
those
the
hand
so
white
that
it
might
have
been
from
the
arm
was
moving
slowly
through
space
on
its
mysterious
purpose
it
closed
the
window
and
with
gesture
delicate
and
elegant
in
its
controlled
it
slowly
drew
the
across
the
window
the
darkness
in
the
room
intensified
no
longer
just
the
out
of
light
but
an
of
the
air
which
made
it
difficult
to
breathe
she
told
herself
that
it
must
be
from
her
half
sleeping
state
and
for
one
moment
she
gazed
at
it
all
terror
past
waiting
for
the
vision
to
into
the
darkness
and
then
all
hope
faded
the
figure
was
at
the
bedside
looking
down
on
her
she
could
nothing
but
white
shape
the
eyes
looking
into
hers
might
be
but
all
she
could
make
out
was
black
she
heard
words
quietly
spoken
but
she
could
make
no
sense
of
them
with
an
effort
she
raised
her
head
from
the
pillow
and
tried
to
out
protest
immediately
time
was
and
in
her
of
terror
she
was
aware
only
of
smell
the
smell
of
linen
out
of
the
darkness
leaning
over
her
was
her
father
face
not
as
she
had
remembered
him
for
over
thirty
years
but
the
face
she
had
briefly
known
in
early
childhood
young
happy
bending
over
her
bed
she
lifted
her
arm
to
touch
the
dressing
but
the
arm
was
too
and
fell
back
she
tried
to
speak
to
move
she
wanted
to
say
look
at
me
ve
got
rid
of
it
her
felt
in
iron
but
now
she
managed
trembling
to
lift
her
right
hand
and
touched
the
dressing
over
the
scar
she
knew
that
this
was
death
and
with
the
knowledge
came
an
peace
letting
go
and
then
the
strong
hand
and
closed
round
her
throat
forcing
her
head
back
against
the
and
the
flung
its
weight
forward
she
wouldn
shut
her
eyes
in
the
face
of
death
nor
did
she
struggle
the
darkness
of
the
room
closed
in
on
her
and
became
the
final
blackness
in
which
all
feeling
ceased
at
twelve
minutes
past
seven
in
the
kitchen
kimberley
was
becoming
anxious
she
had
been
told
by
sister
holland
that
miss
gradwyn
had
asked
for
her
early
morning
tea
tray
to
be
brought
up
at
seven
clock
that
was
earlier
than
the
first
morning
she
had
been
at
the
manor
but
seven
clock
was
the
time
sister
had
told
kim
to
be
ready
to
make
it
and
she
had
set
the
tray
by
six
forty
five
and
placed
the
on
top
of
the
to
warm
and
now
it
was
twelve
minutes
after
seven
and
no
ring
kim
knew
that
dean
needed
her
help
with
the
breakfast
which
was
unexpectedly
mr
chandler
powell
had
asked
for
his
to
be
served
in
his
apartment
which
was
unusual
and
miss
cressett
who
usually
prepared
what
she
wanted
in
her
own
small
kitchen
and
rarely
ate
cooked
breakfast
had
rung
to
say
that
she
would
join
the
household
in
the
dining
room
at
seven
thirty
and
had
been
about
the
required
of
the
and
the
of
the
egg
as
if
thought
kim
any
egg
served
at
the
manor
would
be
other
than
free
and
fresh
and
miss
cressett
knew
that
as
well
as
she
an
added
irritation
was
the
of
sharon
whose
duty
it
was
to
lay
the
breakfast
table
and
turn
on
the
kim
was
to
go
upstairs
and
her
in
case
miss
gradwyn
rang
her
bell
once
again
over
the
of
the
cup
and
milk
on
the
tray
she
turned
to
dean
her
face
puckered
with
anxiety
perhaps
ought
to
take
it
up
sister
said
seven
perhaps
she
meant
that
wait
for
the
ring
that
miss
gradwyn
would
expect
it
promptly
at
seven
her
face
looking
like
that
of
troubled
child
as
always
dean
love
and
pity
with
irritation
he
moved
to
the
telephone
sister
this
is
dean
miss
gradwyn
hasn
rung
for
her
tea
shall
we
wait
or
do
you
want
kim
to
make
it
now
and
take
it
up
the
call
took
less
than
minute
the
receiver
dean
said
you
re
to
take
it
up
sister
says
to
knock
on
her
door
before
you
go
in
she
ll
take
it
in
to
miss
gradwyn
suppose
she
ll
have
the
as
she
did
before
and
the
biscuits
sister
didn
say
any
different
dean
busy
at
the
eggs
said
shortly
if
she
doesn
want
the
biscuits
she
ll
leave
them
the
kettle
quickly
and
within
minutes
the
tea
was
made
dean
as
usual
came
to
the
lift
with
her
and
holding
the
door
open
pressed
the
so
that
she
had
both
hands
free
to
carry
the
tray
emerging
from
the
lift
kim
saw
sister
holland
coming
out
of
her
sitting
room
she
expected
the
tray
to
be
taken
from
her
but
instead
sister
after
glance
opened
the
door
to
miss
gradwyn
suite
obviously
expecting
kim
to
follow
perhaps
kim
thought
that
wasn
surprising
it
wasn
sister
job
to
carry
early
morning
tea
to
the
patients
she
was
carrying
her
torch
so
it
wouldn
in
any
case
have
been
easy
the
sitting
room
was
in
darkness
sister
switched
on
the
light
and
they
moved
to
the
bedroom
door
which
sister
opened
slowly
and
quietly
this
room
too
was
in
darkness
and
there
was
no
sound
not
even
the
soft
noises
of
someone
breathing
miss
gradwyn
must
be
sleeping
kim
thought
it
was
an
silence
like
entering
an
empty
room
she
wasn
usually
conscious
of
the
weight
of
the
tray
but
now
it
seemed
to
grow
by
the
second
she
stayed
in
the
open
doorway
holding
it
if
miss
gradwyn
was
sleeping
late
she
would
have
to
make
another
pot
later
no
good
leaving
this
to
get
over
and
cold
sister
said
her
voice
if
she
still
asleep
there
no
point
in
waking
her
ll
just
check
that
she
all
right
she
moved
to
the
bed
and
swept
the
pale
moon
of
her
torch
over
the
figure
then
switched
it
to
powerful
then
she
switched
it
off
and
in
the
darkness
kim
heard
her
high
urgent
voice
which
didn
sound
like
sister
she
said
get
back
kim
don
come
in
don
look
don
look
but
kim
had
looked
and
for
those
seconds
before
the
went
out
she
had
seen
the
bizarre
image
of
death
dark
hair
on
the
pillow
the
clenched
fists
raised
like
those
of
the
one
open
eye
and
the
mottled
neck
it
wasn
miss
gradwyn
head
it
was
nobody
head
bright
red
head
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
anything
living
she
heard
the
crash
of
falling
china
on
the
carpet
and
to
an
easy
chair
in
the
sitting
room
she
leaned
over
and
was
violently
sick
the
stink
of
her
vomit
rose
to
her
nostrils
and
her
last
thought
before
she
was
new
horror
what
would
miss
cressett
say
about
the
ruined
chair
when
she
came
round
she
was
lying
on
the
bed
in
her
and
dean
bedroom
dean
was
there
and
behind
him
mr
chandler
powell
and
sister
holland
she
lay
for
moment
with
her
eyes
closed
and
heard
sister
voice
and
mr
chandler
powell
reply
didn
you
realise
george
that
she
was
pregnant
how
the
hell
should
not
an
so
they
knew
she
wouldn
have
to
break
the
news
all
she
about
was
the
baby
she
heard
dean
voice
you
ve
been
asleep
after
you
mr
chandler
powell
carried
you
here
and
you
were
given
sedative
it
nearly
lunchtime
mr
chandler
powell
came
forward
and
she
could
feel
his
cool
hands
on
her
how
do
you
feel
kimberley
all
right
better
thank
you
she
sat
up
quite
vigorously
and
looked
at
sister
sister
will
the
baby
be
all
right
sister
holland
said
don
worry
the
baby
will
be
fine
you
could
have
your
lunch
in
here
if
you
prefer
and
dean
will
stay
with
you
miss
cressett
mrs
frensham
and
will
cope

the
dining
room
kim
said
no
all

ll
be
better
working
want
to
get
back
to
the
kitchen

to
be
with
dean
mr
chandler
powell
said

must
all

our
usual
routine

far
as
we
can
but
there

gently
chief
inspector

been
here
but
apparently

the
police
in
the
meantime

we
shall

after

kim
muttered
her
thanks
and
now
they
were
gone
and
sliding
out
of
bed
she
moved
into
the
comfort
of
dean
strong
arms
book
two
december
london
dorset
at
half
past
ten
on
that
saturday
morning
commander
adam
dalgliesh
and
emma
had
an
appointment
to
meet
her
father
to
meet
future
father
in
law
for
the
first
time
especially
with
the
purpose
of
him
that
one
is
shortly
to
marry
his
daughter
is
seldom
an
without
some
dalgliesh
with
vague
recollection
of
had
somehow
that
as
the
he
was
expected
to
see
professor
on
his
own
but
was
easily
persuaded
by
emma
that
they
should
visit
her
father
together
otherwise
darling
he
ll
keep
asking
what
my
views
are
after
all
he
never
yet
seen
you
and
ve
hardly
mentioned
your
name
if
not
there
won
be
sure
he
taken
it
in
he
does
have
tendency
to
although
never
sure
how
much
of
that
is
genuine
are
his
vague
they
are
when
with
him
but
there
nothing
wrong
with
his
brain
he
does
rather
like
to
dalgliesh
thought
that
and
would
be
the
least
of
his
problems
with
his
father
in
law
he
had
noticed
that
men
of
distinction
in
old
age
were
given
to
the
of
youth
and
the
middle
years
as
if
these
self
of
personality
were
defence
against
the
away
of
physical
and
mental
the
of
the
self
in
its
last
years
he
was
uncertain
what
emma
and
her
father
felt
for
each
other
but
surely
there
must
have
been
love
in
memory
at
least
and
affection
emma
had
told
him
that
her
younger
sister
and
than
she
and
killed
in
childhood
by
car
had
been
his
favourite
child
but
she
had
spoken
without
note
of
criticism
and
no
resentment
resentment
was
not
an
emotion
he
with
emma
but
however
difficult
the
relationship
she
would
want
this
meeting
between
father
and
lover
to
be
success
it
was
his
job
to
ensure
that
it
was
that
it
didn
remain
an
embarrassment
or
lasting
in
her
memory
all
that
dalgliesh
knew
of
emma
childhood
had
been
told
in
those
snatches
of
conversation
in
which
each
with
footsteps
the
of
the
other
past
on
his
retirement
professor
had
rejected
oxford
in
favour
of
london
and
lived
in
flat
in
one
of
as
most
of
them
were
by
the
description
the
was
not
too
distant
from
with
its
regular
train
service
to
oxford
where
the
professor
was
and
his
daughter
suspected
occasionally
too
at
his
college
high
table
an
college
and
his
wife
who
had
moved
to
town
to
live
with
daughter
came
in
daily
to
do
the
necessary
cleaning
and
returned
later
to
cook
the
professor
dinner
he
had
been
over
forty
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
and
although
now
just
over
was
perfectly
competent
to
look
after
himself
at
least
in
but
the
had
convinced
themselves
with
some
on
his
part
that
they
were
caring
for
and
distinguished
old
only
the
final
was
appropriate
the
view
of
his
colleagues
visiting
was
that
had
done
very
well
for
himself
dalgliesh
and
emma
took
to
the
arriving
as
arranged
with
the
professor
at
half
past
ten
the
had
recently
been
the
an
unfortunate
colour
which
dalgliesh
thought
could
most
be
described
as
the
lift
mirror
panelled
and
smelling
strongly
of
furniture
polish
took
them
up
to
the
third
floor
the
door
to
number
was
opened
so
promptly
that
dalgliesh
suspected
that
their
had
been
watching
for
their
from
his
windows
the
man
facing
him
was
almost
as
tall
as
he
with
strong
handsome
face
under
of
steel
grey
hair
he
was
supported
by
stick
but
his
shoulders
were
only
slightly
bent
and
the
dark
eyes
the
only
resemblance
to
his
daughter
had
lost
their
but
regarded
dalgliesh
with
look
that
was
surprisingly
keen
he
was
and
dressed
but
looked
immaculate
he
said
come
in
come
in
with
an
impatience
which
implied
that
they
were
at
the
door
they
were
led
into
large
front
room
with
bay
window
it
was
obviously
library
indeed
given
the
fact
that
every
wall
was
of
book
and
that
the
and
practically
all
other
were
heaped
with
and
there
was
room
for
no
other
than
reading
an
upright
chair
facing
the
desk
had
been
cleared
by
the
papers
beneath
it
giving
it
in
dalgliesh
eyes
naked
and
somehow
ominous
professor
having
pulled
out
his
chair
from
the
desk
and
seated
himself
dalgliesh
to
take
the
empty
chair
the
dark
eyes
under
brows
now
grey
but
shaped
like
emma
stared
at
dalgliesh
over
half
moon
emma
walked
over
to
the
window
dalgliesh
suspected
that
she
was
preparing
to
enjoy
herself
after
all
her
father
couldn
the
marriage
she
would
like
his
approval
but
had
no
intention
of
being
influenced
by
either
or
but
it
was
right
that
they
should
be
there
dalgliesh
had
an
awareness
that
he
should
have
come
earlier
the
start
was
not
propitious
commander
dalgliesh
hope
have
your
rank
yes
thank
you
thought
that
was
what
emma
told
me
have
guessed
why
you
are
making
what
for
busy
man
like
yourself
must
be
somewhat
inconveniently
visit
feel
bound
to
tell
you
that
you
are
not
down
on
my
list
of
young
men
however
am
quite
ready
to
enter
your
name
should
your
be
what
an
father
so
they
were
to
be
to
for
the
dialogue
of
this
personal
dalgliesh
felt
grateful
the
professor
might
well
have
from
his
obviously
still
memory
some
passage
from
drama
or
fiction
probably
in
as
it
was
he
thought
he
could
keep
his
end
up
he
said
nothing
professor
went
on
think
it
is
usual
to
whether
you
have
an
income
sufficient
to
keep
my
daughter
in
the
to
which
she
has
become
emma
has
supported
herself
since
she
got
her
apart
from
and
occasional
from
myself
probably
meant
to
for
previous
as
father
should
take
it
you
have
sufficient
money
for
the
two
of
you
to
live
comfortably
have
my
salary
as
commander
of
the
police
and
my
aunt
left
me
her
considerable
fortune
in
land
or
in
in
that
is
what
between
the
duties
expected
of
one
during
one
and
the
duties
from
one
after
one
death
land
has
ceased
to
be
either
profit
or
pleasure
it
one
position
and
one
from
keeping
it
up
that
all
that
can
be
said
about
land
you
have
house
have
flat
the
at
with
lease
of
over
one
hundred
years
have
no
house
not
even
on
the
side
of
square
then
suggest
you
one
girl
with
simple
nature
like
emma
could
hardly
be
expected
to
in
flat
at
the
even
with
lease
of
over
one
hundred
years
emma
said
love
the
flat
the
remark
was
ignored
the
professor
had
obviously
decided
that
the
effort
to
continue
the
was
to
the
pleasure
it
gave
him
he
said
well
that
seems
and
now
believe
it
is
to
offer
you
both
drink
personally
dislike
and
white
wine
with
me
but
there
is
bottle
of
on
the
kitchen
table
ten
forty
in
the
morning
is
hardly
an
appropriate
time
to
begin
so
suggest
you
take
it
with
you
don
suppose
you
ll
be
staying
long
or
he
said
you
could
have
coffee
mrs
me
that
she
has
left
everything
ready
emma
said
firmly
we
like
the
wine
then
perhaps
you
could
see
to
it
they
went
together
into
the
kitchen
it
seemed
to
shut
the
door
so
both
managed
to
an
impulse
to
into
laughter
the
wine
was
bottle
of
de
dalgliesh
said
this
is
an
impressive
bottle
because
he
liked
you
wonder
if
bottle
of
is
waiting
in
his
desk
drawer
in
case
he
didn
wouldn
put
it
past
him
they
returned
to
the
library
dalgliesh
carrying
the
bottle
he
said
thank
you
sir
we
ll
save
this
for
special
occasion
which
we
hope
will
be
when
you
re
able
to
join
us
maybe
maybe
don
often
out
except
in
college
perhaps
when
the
weather
the
don
like
my
out
on
cold
nights
emma
said
we
hope
you
ll
come
to
the
wedding
it
will
be
in
the
spring
probably
may
in
the
college
ll
let
you
know
as
soon
as
we
have
date
certainly
ll
come
if
well
enough
it
as
my
duty
gather
by
to
the
book
of
common
not
my
reading
that
shall
be
expected
to
take
some
non
and
ill
defined
part
in
the
proceedings
that
certainly
was
the
case
with
my
own
father
in
law
at
our
wedding
also
in
the
college
he
your
poor
mother
up
the
aisle
as
if
afraid
that
might
change
my
mind
if
kept
waiting
should
my
be
required
hope
to
do
better
but
perhaps
you
will
the
idea
of
daughter
being
formally
handed
over
to
the
possession
of
another
expect
you
are
anxious
to
be
on
your
way
commander
mrs
said
that
she
might
arrive
this
morning
with
some
things
need
she
will
be
sorry
to
have
missed
you
at
the
door
emma
moved
up
to
her
father
and
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
suddenly
he
clutched
her
and
dalgliesh
saw
his
knuckles
the
grasp
was
so
strong
that
it
looked
as
if
the
old
man
needed
support
in
the
seconds
when
they
were
clasped
together
dalgliesh
mobile
phone
rang
not
in
any
previous
had
its
low
but
distinctive
seemed
more
inappropriate
his
hold
on
emma
her
father
said
have
particular
of
mobile
couldn
you
have
switched
that
thing
off
not
this
one
sir
will
you
excuse
me
he
moved
towards
the
kitchen
the
professor
called
you
better
close
the
door
as
you
ve
probably
discovered
my
hearing
is
still
assistant
of
the
police
was
experienced
in
information
and
in
terms
designed
to
question
or
discussion
now
within
six
months
of
retirement
he
on
well
tested
for
that
his
professional
life
moved
gently
to
its
final
without
major
public
embarrassment
or
disaster
dalgliesh
knew
that
had
his
retirement
job
as
security
to
large
comfortably
settled
and
at
three
times
his
present
salary
good
luck
to
him
between
him
and
dalgliesh
there
was
respect
sometimes
grudging
on
part
but
not
friendship
his
voice
now
sounded
as
it
often
did
impatient
but
with
its
controlled
case
for
the
squad
adam
the
address
is
cheverell
manor
in
dorset
some
ten
miles
west
of
it
run
by
surgeon
george
chandler
powell
as
something
between
clinic
and
nursing
home
anyway
he
on
rich
patients
who
want
surgery
one
of
them
is
dead
rhoda
gradwyn
apparently
dalgliesh
asked
the
obvious
question
it
wasn
the
first
time
he
had
had
to
ask
it
and
it
was
never
well
received
why
the
squad
can
the
local
force
take
it
on
they
could
take
it
on
but
we
ve
been
asked
for
you
don
ask
me
why
it
come
from
number
ten
not
here
look
adam
you
know
how
things
are
between
us
and
street
at
present
it
not
the
time
to
start
making
the
squad
was
set
up
to
investigate
cases
of
particular
and
number
ten
takes
the
view
that
this
case
into
that
the
chief
think
you
know
him
is
reasonably
happy
about
it
and
he
ll
provide
the
and
the
photographer
if
you
re
happy
with
that
it
will
save
time
and
money
it
hardly
but
it
urgent
of
course
it
always
is
what
about
the
pathologist
like
he
already
on
case
but
glenister
is
free
you
had
her
for
the
island
murder
remember
hardly
likely
to
forget
suppose
the
force
can
provide
the
incident
room
and
some
they
ve
got
cottage
free
some
hundred
yards
or
so
from
the
manor
it
used
to
be
the
house
of
the
village
but
they
didn
replace
him
when
he
retired
and
at
present
it
empty
awaiting
sale
there
further
down
the
road
so
suppose
miskin
and
benton
smith
can
make
themselves
comfortable
there
there
ll
be
chief
inspector
keith
from
the
local
force
to
meet
you
at
the
scene
they
re
not
the
body
until
you
and
glenister
arrive
do
you
want
me
to
do
anything
more
this
end
dalgliesh
said
no
ll
get
on
to
inspector
miskin
and
sergeant
benton
smith
but
it
will
save
time
if
someone
could
speak
to
my
secretary
there
are
meetings
on
monday
which
ll
have
to
miss
and
tuesday
had
better
be
after
that
ll
be
in
touch
said
right
ll
see
to
it
good
luck
and
replaced
the
receiver
he
returned
to
the
library
professor
said
not
bad
news
hope
your
parents
are
well
both
have
died
sir
that
was
an
official
call
afraid
that
shall
have
to
leave
urgently
then
mustn
keep
you
they
were
being
to
the
door
with
what
seemed
unnecessary
speed
dalgliesh
feared
that
the
professor
might
comment
that
to
lose
one
parent
may
be
regarded
as
but
to
lose
both
looked
very
like
but
it
was
apparent
that
there
were
some
that
even
his
future
father
in
law
at
they
walked
swiftly
to
the
car
dalgliesh
knew
that
emma
whatever
her
plans
wouldn
expect
him
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
drop
her
he
needed
to
get
to
his
office
without
minute
delay
he
didn
need
to
express
his
disappointment
emma
understood
both
its
and
its
as
they
walked
together
he
asked
about
her
plans
for
the
next
two
days
would
she
stay
in
london
or
return
to
cambridge
and
have
said
that
if
our
plans
come
they
love
me
to
stay
for
the
weekend
ll
give
them
ring
was
emma
best
friend
and
dalgliesh
understood
what
she
valued
in
her
honesty
and
common
sense
he
had
met
and
now
they
were
at
ease
with
each
other
but
the
early
days
of
his
love
for
emma
hadn
been
easy
had
made
it
plain
that
she
considered
him
to
be
too
old
too
absorbed
in
his
job
and
his
to
make
serious
commitment
to
any
woman
and
simply
not
good
enough
for
emma
dalgliesh
agreed
with
the
last
self
which
didn
make
it
any
more
agreeable
to
hear
it
from
another
particularly
not
from
emma
must
lose
nothing
by
her
love
for
him
and
emma
had
known
each
other
from
their
had
gone
in
the
same
year
to
the
same
cambridge
college
and
though
subsequently
taking
very
different
had
never
lost
touch
it
was
on
the
face
of
it
surprising
friendship
explained
by
the
of
emma
with
her
heart
beauty
which
dalgliesh
knew
could
be
more
burden
than
the
and
of
popular
imagination
short
with
round
face
bright
eyed
behind
large
and
with
the
walk
of
that
she
was
attractive
to
men
was
to
dalgliesh
one
more
example
of
the
mystery
of
sexual
appeal
he
had
sometimes
wondered
whether
first
response
to
him
had
been
by
or
regret
both
seemed
unlikely
was
so
obviously
happy
with
her
partner
the
frail
gentle
faced
who
dalgliesh
suspected
was
than
she
looked
it
was
who
made
their
flat
place
where
no
one
entered
without
in
words
the
expectation
of
happiness
after
first
in
had
begun
working
in
the
city
where
she
was
highly
successful
manager
colleagues
came
and
went
but
was
retained
emma
had
told
him
that
she
planned
to
leave
the
job
in
three
years
time
when
she
and
would
use
the
considerable
capital
to
begin
very
different
life
in
the
meantime
much
of
what
she
was
spent
on
good
close
to
heart
three
months
earlier
emma
and
he
had
attended
the
of
and
quietly
celebration
at
which
only
parents
father
and
few
close
friends
had
been
guests
afterwards
there
had
been
lunch
cooked
by
in
the
flat
after
the
second
course
was
finished
and
dalgliesh
together
carried
plates
into
the
kitchen
to
bring
in
the
pudding
it
was
then
she
had
turned
to
him
with
resolution
which
suggested
that
she
had
been
waiting
for
this
opportunity
it
must
seem
in
us
to
tie
legal
knot
when
you
are
in
thousands
to
divorce
or
living
together
without
benefit
of
marriage
we
were
perfectly
happy
as
we
were
but
we
needed
to
ensure
that
each
is
the
other
recognised
next
of
kin
if
is
ever
in
hospital
need
to
be
there
and
then
there
the
if
die
first
it
must
go
to
expect
she
ll
spend
most
of
it
on
but
that
up
to
her
it
won
be
wasted
is
very
wise
people
think
that
our
because
the
stronger
and
needs
me
actually
the
is
true
and
you
re
one
of
the
rare
people
who
ve
seen
that
from
the
start
thank
you
for
being
with
us
today
dalgliesh
knew
those
last
spoken
words
had
been
the
of
an
acceptance
which
once
given
would
be
he
was
glad
that
whatever
the
unknown
faces
problems
and
that
lay
ahead
for
him
in
the
next
few
days
emma
weekend
would
be
in
his
imagination
and
for
her
would
be
happy
for
detective
inspector
kate
miskin
her
flat
on
the
north
bank
of
the
from
was
celebration
of
in
the
only
form
which
for
her
had
any
hope
of
in
steel
and
wood
she
had
known
when
first
taking
possession
of
the
flat
that
it
was
too
expensive
for
her
and
the
first
few
years
of
paying
the
had
meant
she
had
made
them
she
had
never
lost
that
first
excitement
of
walking
through
rooms
full
of
light
of
waking
and
falling
asleep
to
the
changing
but
never
ending
of
the
hers
was
the
top
floor
corner
flat
with
two
giving
wide
views
and
to
the
opposite
bank
except
in
the
worst
weather
she
could
stand
silently
contemplating
the
changing
of
the
river
the
power
of
brown
god
the
of
the
tide
the
glittering
stretch
of
pale
blue
under
hot
summer
and
after
dark
the
black
skin
with
light
she
watched
for
the
familiar
as
if
they
were
returning
friends
the
of
the
of
london
authority
and
the
river
police
the
the
low
in
the
summer
the
pleasure
and
the
small
and
most
of
all
the
tall
their
young
the
as
they
moved
with
to
pass
under
the
great
raised
arms
of
bridge
into
the
pool
of
london
the
flat
could
not
be
more
different
from
those
rooms
on
the
seventh
floor
of
where
she
had
been
brought
up
by
her
grandmother
from
the
smell
the
the
rubbish
the
screaming
voices
the
ever
constant
awareness
of
danger
as
small
child
she
had
walked
frightened
and
wary
eyed
in
an
her
childhood
had
been
defined
for
her
by
the
words
of
her
grandmother
to
neighbour
when
she
was
seven
and
never
forgotten
if
her
ma
had
to
have
an
kid
at
least
she
could
have
stayed
alive
to
look
after
it
not
dumped
it
on
me
she
never
knew
the
father
or
if
she
did
she
wasn
saying
in
she
had
taught
herself
to
forgive
her
grandmother
tired
poor
she
was
with
burden
she
hadn
expected
and
didn
want
what
remained
with
kate
and
always
would
was
the
knowledge
that
never
to
have
known
either
parent
was
to
live
life
with
some
part
of
you
missing
hole
in
the
which
could
never
be
filled
but
she
had
her
flat
job
she
loved
and
was
good
at
and
until
six
months
ago
there
had
been
they
had
been
so
close
to
love
although
neither
of
them
ever
spoke
the
word
but
she
knew
how
much
he
had
her
life
he
had
left
the
special
investigation
squad
to
join
the
met
anti
and
although
much
of
his
present
work
was
secret
they
could
the
old
days
when
they
had
been
colleagues
they
used
the
same
language
he
understood
the
of
as
no
ever
could
she
had
always
found
him
attractive
but
while
they
were
colleagues
knew
that
an
affair
would
be
ad
was
of
anything
which
could
damage
the
of
the
squad
and
one
or
probably
both
of
them
would
have
been
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
years
of
working
alongside
each
other
the
shared
danger
exhaustion
and
even
at
times
the
for
ad
had
so
bound
them
together
that
when
they
became
lovers
it
was
natural
and
happy
of
something
which
had
always
but
six
months
ago
she
had
ended
the
affair
and
she
couldn
regret
her
decision
for
her
it
was
to
have
partner
who
was
she
had
never
expected
in
any
relationship
nothing
in
her
childhood
and
youth
had
ever
promised
that
but
what
for
him
had
been
had
for
her
been
betrayal
she
had
sent
him
away
and
she
had
heard
and
seen
nothing
of
him
since
looking
back
she
told
herself
that
from
the
start
she
had
been
after
all
she
had
known
his
reputation
the
break
had
happened
when
at
the
last
moment
she
had
decided
to
attend
farewell
party
it
threatened
to
be
the
usual
affair
and
she
had
long
farewell
parties
but
she
had
worked
with
for
short
time
when
she
was
detective
and
he
had
been
good
boss
helpful
and
without
the
then
all
too
common
against
female
officers
she
would
put
in
an
appearance
to
wish
him
good
luck
fighting
her
way
through
the
crowd
she
had
seen
at
the
centre
of
group
the
blonde
who
was
herself
round
him
was
so
dressed
that
the
men
had
difficulty
in
deciding
whether
to
focus
on
her
or
her
breasts
there
had
been
no
doubt
of
their
relationship
this
had
been
lay
and
they
were
both
happy
to
it
he
had
seen
kate
through
the
gap
in
the
close
packed
crowd
their
eyes
had
briefly
met
but
before
he
had
time
to
break
through
and
approach
her
she
had
left
early
the
next
morning
he
had
arrived
and
the
break
had
been
much
of
what
they
had
said
was
now
forgotten
but
snatches
still
echoed
in
her
mind
like
look
kate
it
it
didn
mean
anything
she
doesn
mean
anything
know
that
what
object
to
you
re
asking
lot
of
me
kate
not
asking
anything
of
you
if
that
how
you
want
to
live
that
your
affair
simply
telling
you
that
don
want
to
have
sex
with
man
who
sleeping
with
other
women
that
may
sound
in
world
where
one
night
stand
means
another
on
your
but
that
how
am
and
can
change
so
for
us
it
the
end
it
good
thing
neither
of
us
is
in
love
we
ll
be
spared
the
usual
of
tears
and
could
give
her
up
and
the
next
one
and
the
one
after
that
you
haven
begun
to
understand
not
offering
sex
as
good
prize
don
want
excuses
it
the
end
and
it
had
been
the
end
for
six
months
he
had
disappeared
completely
from
her
life
she
told
herself
she
was
getting
used
to
being
without
him
but
it
hadn
been
easy
she
missed
more
than
the
mutual
of
their
the
laughter
the
drinks
in
their
favourite
the
free
the
meals
in
her
flat
which
they
cooked
together
all
had
released
in
her
light
hearted
confidence
in
life
which
she
had
never
before
known
she
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
the
future
there
was
no
one
else
in
whom
she
could
confide
the
next
case
might
well
be
her
last
it
was
certain
that
the
special
investigation
squad
wouldn
continue
in
its
present
form
commander
dalgliesh
had
so
far
managed
to
official
plans
to
the
its
functions
in
devised
to
rather
than
and
the
squad
in
some
more
the
had
because
of
its
success
relative
not
in
some
eyes
convenient
and
because
it
was
headed
by
one
of
the
country
most
distinguished
the
of
the
met
ground
and
more
often
than
not
produced
of
among
the
the
present

all
come
to
her
ears
dalgliesh
the
of
the
met
and
much
else
himself
wanted
to
ad

no
intention
of
and
would
shortly
take
over

with
detective
training

been
made
to
him
from

him
for
an
job
at
salary
four
times
that
at
present
enjoyed
by
the
kate
and
benton
had
all
questions
with
silence
it
had
required
no
self
they
knew
nothing
but
were
confident
that
when
ad
had
made
his
choice
they
would
be
among
the
first
to
be
told
the
chief
for
whom
she
had
worked
since
she
became
detective
sergeant
would
be
his
emma
in
few
months
after
the
years
together
he
and
she
would
no
longer
be
part
of
the
same
team
she
would
get
her
promised
to
detective
chief
inspector
perhaps
within
weeks
and
could
hope
to
rise
even
higher
the
future
might
be
lonely
but
if
it
were
she
had
her
job
the
only
one
she
had
ever
wanted
the
one
which
had
given
her
all
she
now
possessed
and
she
knew
better
than
most
that
there
were
worse
than
the
call
came
at
ten
fifty
she
wasn
due
in
the
office
until
one
thirty
and
was
about
to
leave
the
flat
to
deal
with
the
routine
which
always
took
hours
out
of
her
free
half
day
visit
to
the
to
buy
food
watch
that
was
being
to
collect
some
clothes
to
be
taken

the
call
came
on
her

and
she
knew
whose
voice
she
would
hear
she
listened
closely
it
was
as
she
had
expected

the
victim
rhoda
gradwyn
an
investigative
journalist
found
dead
in
her
bed
at
seven
thirty
apparently
after
an

in
dorset
he
gave
the
address
as
cheverell
manor
stoke
cheverell
no
explanation
of
why
the
squad
were
taking
over
but
apparently
number
ten
was
involved
they
were
to
travel
by
car
either
hers
or
benton
and
the
team
would
to
arrive
together
she
said
yes
sir
ll
ring
benton
now
and
meet
him
at
his
flat
think
we
ll
take
his
car

his
right
need

meet
you
at
shepherd
hope
by
the
time
you
get
there
ll
give
you
further
details
as
far
as
know
them
when
we
meet
she
ended
the
call
then
rang
benton
and
within
twenty
minutes
had
changed
into
the
tweed
trousers
and
jacket
she
wore
for
country
case
her
grip
with
other
clothes
she
might
need
was
always
packed
and
ready
swiftly
she
checked
windows
and
power
and
picking
up
her
murder
bag
turned
the
keys
in
the
two
security
locks
and
was
on
her
way
kate
call
to
sergeant
benton
smith
came
while
he
was
shopping
in
the
hill
market
his
day
had
been
carefully
planned
and
he
was
in
the
excellent
spirits
of
man
who
could
look
forward
to
well
rest
day
which
more
pleasure
than
rest
he
had
promised
to
cook
lunch
for
his
parents
in
the
kitchen
of
their
south
home
would
later
spend
the
afternoon
in
bed
with
in
his
shepherd
flat
and
planned
to
end
perfect
mixture
of
duty
and
pleasure
by
taking
her
to
see
the
new
at
the
the
day
would
also
be
for
him
private
celebration
of
his
recent
as
boyfriend
the
word
slightly
irritated
him
but
it
seemed
inappropriate
to
describe
her
as
his
lover
which
to
his
mind
suggested
greater
degree
of
commitment
was
an
she
insisted
that
she
should
not
be
described
as
an
and
was
making
career
for
herself
on
television
she
had
from
the
start
made
it
clear
where
her
lay
she
liked
variety
in
her
but
was
as
of
as
any
her
sex
life
was
time
of
single
affairs
few
as
she
was
considerate
enough
to
benton
with
any
hope
of
lasting
for
more
than
six
months
despite
the
of
her
neat
little
body
she
loved
food
and
he
knew
that
part
of
his
had
been
the
meals
either
in
carefully
chosen
which
he
could
ill
afford
or
as
she
preferred
cooked
by
him
at
home
this
lunch
to
which
she
had
been
invited
was
planned
in
part
to
remind
her
what
she
had
been
missing
he
had
met
her
parents
once
and
only
briefly
and
was
surprised
that
this
couple
conventional
well
dressed
and
physically
should
have
produced
such
an
child
he
loved
to
look
at
her
the
pale
face
dark
hair
cut
in
fringe
over
slightly
eyes
which
gave
her
she
came
from
background
as
privileged
as
his
and
despite
her
efforts
had
never
succeeded
in
losing
all
evidence
of
good
general
education
but
the
despised
and
had
been
rejected
in
the
service
of
her
art
and
in
speech
and
appearance
she
had
become
the
daughter
of
in
television
soap
set
in
village
when
they
had
first
come
together
her
acting
had
been
bright
there
were
then
plans
for
an
affair
with
the
church
pregnancy
and
an
operation
and
general
in
the
village
but
there
had
been
from
that
this
country
was
beginning
to
with
and
the
now
was
that
was
to
be
there
was
even
suggestion
of
marriage
and
as
complained
it
was
disaster
already
her
agent
was
putting
out
to
on
her
present
while
it
lasted
he
was
only
benton
to
his
colleagues
at
the
met
had
no
doubt
that
the
lunch
would
be
success
his
parents
were
always
curious
to
learn
about
the
mysterious
to
which
they
had
no
access
and
would
be
happy
to
provide
of
the
probably
with
dialogue
his
own
appearance
was
he
felt
as
as
his
father
was
english
his
mother
and
he
had
inherited
her
beauty
but
none
of
the
deep
to
her
country
which
she
had
never
lost
and
which
her
husband
shared
they
had
married
when
she
was
eighteen
and
he
twelve
years
older
they
had
been
in
love
and
remained
in
love
and
their
annual
visits
to
were
the
of
their
year
throughout
he
had
accompanied
them
but
always
with
sense
of
being
an
alien
ill
at
ease
unable
to
in
world
to
which
his
father
who
seemed
happier
more
light
hearted
in
than
in
england
himself
in
speech
dress
and
food
he
had
felt
too
from
early
childhood
that
his
parents
love
was
too
all
consuming
to
admit
of
third
person
even
an
only
child
he
knew
he
was
loved
but
in
the
company
of
his
father
retired
headmaster
had
always
felt
more
like
and
valued
sixth
than
son
their
benign
non
interference
was
disconcerting
when
he
was
sixteen
listening
to
the
of
school
friend
about
his
parents
the
ridiculous
rule
about
coming
home
before
midnight
the
about
drugs
heavy
drinking
their
that
should
take
over
pleasure
about
clothes
and
the
state
of
his
room
which
after
all
was
supposed
to
be
private
had
made
feel
that
his
parents
amounted
to
an
which
was
close
to
emotional
this
was
not
what
was
supposed
to
be
his
father
response
to
his
choice
of
career
had
been
one
that
he
suspected
had
been
used
before
there
are
only
two
important
things
about
one
choice
of
job
that
it
should
the
happiness
and
well
being
of
others
and
give
satisfaction
to
you
the
police
service
the
first
and
hope
that
it
will
the
second
he
had
almost
had
to
stop
himself
from
saying
thank
you
sir
but
he
knew
that
he
loved
his
parents
and
was
sometimes
quietly
aware
that
the
was
not
all
on
their
side
and
that
he
saw
them
too
seldom
this
lunch
was
to
be
some
small
for
the
call
came
on
his
mobile
at
ten
fifty
five
while
he
was
adding

his
of

hungry
as
kate
rang
off
benton
reflected
that
he
already
knew
that
he
had
only
two
calls
to
make
one
to
his
parents
and
one
to
his
mother
took
the
call
and
no
time
quickly
expressed
her
and
rang
off
didn
answer
her
mobile
which
he
felt
was
just
as
well
he
left
simple
message
that
their
plans
would
have
to
be
and
said
he
would
call
later
it
took
him
only
minutes
to
buy
the
sandwiches
and
drink
running
from
the
market
to
holland
park
avenue
he
saw
that
number
bus
was
just
at
the
stop
and
managed
to
in
before
the
doors
closed
already
his
plans
for
the
day
were
forgotten
and
he
was
looking
ahead
to
the
more
demanding
task
of
his
reputation
with
the
squad
it
worried
him
but
only
slightly
that
this
the
sense
that
the
immediate
future
was
full
of
excitement
and
challenge
on
an
unknown
body
in
dorset
manor
house
on
grief
and
fear
he
admitted
and
not
without
small
of
that
it
would
be
to
arrive
in
dorset
to
find
that
after
all
this
was
only
commonplace
murder
and
that
the
had
already
been
identified
and
it
had
never
yet
happened
and
he
knew
that
it
was
unlikely
the
squad
was
never
called
in
to
commonplace
murder
standing
at
the
bus
doors
he
waited
for
them
to
open
then
to
his
of
the
lift
he
stood
listening
for
its
it
was
then
that
he
realised
without
in
the
least
caring
that
he
had
left
his
bag
of
carefully
selected
vegetables
in
the
bus
it
was
one
thirty
six
hours
after
the
finding
of
the
body
but
for
dean
and
kimberley
bostock
waiting
in
the
kitchen
until
someone
arrived
to
tell
them
what
to
do
the
morning
seemed
this
was
their
the
place
where
they
were
at
home
in
control
never
knowing
that
they
were
valued
even
if
the
words
weren
often
spoken
confident
in
their
professional
skills
and
above
all
together
but
now
they
drifted
from
table
to
like
in
an
unfamiliar
