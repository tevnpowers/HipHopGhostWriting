looked
as
with
of
dust
she
joined
the
stream
of
fellow
guests
who
little
were
moving
to
room
at
the
rear
which
proclaimed
its
by
board
and
printed
notice
room
available
for
private
parties
for
moment
she
paused
in
the
doorway
then
entered
and
saw
her
mother
at
once
she
was
standing
with
her
by
little
group
of
women
rhoda
entrance
was
almost
but
she
edged
through
them
and
saw
her
mother
face
breaking
into
smile
it
had
been
four
years
since
they
had
met
but
she
looked
younger
and
happier
and
after
few
seconds
kissed
rhoda
on
the
right
cheek
little
then
turned
to
the
man
at
her
side
he
was
old
at
least
rhoda
judged
rather
shorter
than
her
mother
with
soft
round
pleasant
but
anxious
face
he
seemed
little
confused
and
her
mother
had
to
rhoda
name
twice
before
he
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
there
were
general
the
guests
ignored
the
scar
few
children
gazed
at
it
then
ran
off
shouting
through
the
windows
to
play
outside
rhoda
remembered
snatches
of
conversation
your
mother
of
you
so
often
she
very
proud
of
you
it
good
of
you
to
come
so
far
lovely
day
for
it
isn
it
nice
to
see
her
so
happy
the
food
and
the
service
were
better
than
she
had
expected
the
on
the
long
table
was
immaculate
the
cups
and
plates
shone
and
her
first
confirmed
that
the
ham
in
the
sandwiches
was
fresh
off
the
bone
three
middle
aged
women
dressed
as
served
them
with
strong
tea
was
poured
from
an
immense
pot
and
after
certain
amount
of
whispering
between
the
and
variety
of
drinks
was
brought
in
from
the
bar
the
conversation
which
had
so
far
been
as
as
if
they
had
recently
attended
funeral
became
more
and
glasses
some
containing
of
highly
ominous
were
raised
after
much
anxious
between
her
mother
and
the
were
brought
in
with
some
there
was
to
be
toast
the
proceedings
were
in
the
hands
of
the
vicar
who
had
the
service
red
haired
young
man
who
of
his
now
wore
dog
with
grey
trousers
and
jacket
he
gently
patted
the
air
as
if
to
and
made
brief
speech
apparently
was
the
church
and
there
was
some
humour
about
pulling
out
all
the
and
the
two
of
them
living
in
to
their
lives
end
with
small
jokes
now
which
had
been
greeted
by
the
of
the
guests
with
embarrassed
laughter
there
was
at
the
table
so
plate
in
hand
she
moved
over
to
the
window
grateful
for
the
moment
when
the
guests
obviously
hungry
for
the
food
were
unlikely
to
her
she
watched
them
with
mixture
of
and
amusement
the
men
in
their
best
some
now
little
stretched
over
rounded
and
backs
the
women
who
had
obviously
made
efforts
and
had
seen
an
opportunity
for
new
most
like
her
mother
were
wearing
summer
dresses
with
matching
their
in
colours
sitting
on
newly
set
hair
they
could
she
thought
have
looked
much
the
same
in
the
and
she
was
by
new
and
unwelcome
emotion
of
pity
and
anger
she
thought
don
belong
here
not
happy
with
them
nor
they
with
me
their
embarrassed
mutual
can
bridge
the
gap
between
us
but
this
is
where
came
from
these
are
my
people
the
upper
working
class
into
the
middle
class
that
group
who
fought
the
country
paid
their
clung
to
what
remained
of
their
they
had
lived
to
see
their
simple
their
despised
their
they
caused
no
trouble
of
pounds
of
public
money
wasn
regularly
into
their
in
the
hope
of
or
them
into
if
they
that
their
had
become
alien
their
children
taught
in
schools
where
of
the
children
spoke
no
english
they
were
about
the
of
by
those
more
and
comfortably
by
they
were
the
of
the
no
of
social
concern
and
had
grown
up
to
and
their
on
the
grounds
of
or
perhaps
she
should
write
about
them
before
she
finally
but
she
knew
that
with
more
interesting
and
ahead
she
never
would
they
had
no
place
in
her
plans
for
her
future
just
as
they
had
no
place
in
her
life
her
last
memory
was
of
standing
alone
with
her
mother
in
the
women
gazing
at
their
two
in
long
mirror
above
of
flowers
her
mother
said
likes
you
could
see
that
glad
you
could
come
so
am
liked
him
too
hope
you
ll
both
be
very
happy
sure
we
shall
we
ve
known
each
other
for
four
years
now
his
wife
in
the
lovely
voice
unusual
in
woman
really
we
ve
always
got
on
and
he
so
kind
her
voice
was
gazing
into
the
mirror
she
her
hat
rhoda
said
yes
he
looks
kind
oh
he
is
he
no
trouble
and
know
that
this
is
what
would
have
wanted
she
more
or
less
at
it
to
me
before
she
died
has
never
been
good
at
being
alone
and
we
shall
be
all
right
for
money
mean
he
going
to
sell
his
house
and
move
into
the
bungalow
with
me
that
seems
sensible
now
that
he
so
that
standing
order
you
have
the
five
hundred
pounds
month
you
don
have
to
go
on
with
that
rhoda
should
leave
it
as
it
is
that
is
unless
isn
happy
about
it
it
isn
that
little
bit
extra
always
comes
in
useful
just
thought
you
might
need
it
yourself
she
turned
and
touched
rhoda
left
cheek
touch
so
soft
that
rhoda
was
only
conscious
of
the
fingers
shaking
in
gentle
against
the
scar
she
closed
her
eyes
willing
herself
not
to
but
she
didn
draw
back
her
mother
said
he
wasn
bad
man
rhoda
it
was
the
drink
you
to
blame
him
it
was
an
illness
and
he
loved
you
really
that
money
he
sent
you
after
you
left
home
it
wasn
easy
finding
it
he
spent
nothing
on
himself
rhoda
thought
except
on
drink
but
she
didn
speak
the
words
she
had
never
her
father
for
that
five
pounds
had
never
spoken
to
him
after
she
left
home
her
mother
voice
seemed
to
come
out
of
silence
remember
those
in
the
park
she
remembered
the
in
the
park
when
it
seemed
always
the
straight
the
rectangular
or
round
thick
with
the
colours
of
she
hated
walking
beside
her
father
neither
speaking
her
mother
said
he
was
all
right
when
he
wasn
drinking
don
remember
him
when
he
wasn
drinking
had
she
spoken
those
words
or
only
thought
them
it
wasn
easy
for
him
working
for
the
council
know
he
was
lucky
to
get
that
job
after
he
been
from
the
law
firm
but
it
was
beneath
him
he
was
clever
rhoda
that
where
you
get
your
he
won
to
university
and
he
came
in
first
you
mean
he
got
first
think
that
what
he
said
anyway
it
means
he
was
clever
that
why
he
was
so
proud
when
you
got
into
the
school
never
knew
he
been
to
university
he
never
told
me
well
he
wouldn
would
he
he
thought
you
weren
interested
he
wasn
one
for
talking
not
about
himself
none
of
them
had
been
those
of
violence
the
rage
the
shame
had
done
for
them
all
the
important
things
had
been
and
looking
into
her
mother
face
she
asked
herself
how
could
she
begin
now
she
thought
her
mother
was
right
it
couldn
have
been
easy
for
her
father
to
find
that
five
note
week
after
week
it
had
come
with
few
words
sometimes
in
shaky
handwriting
which
simply
said
with
love
from
father
she
had
taken
the
money
because
she
needed
it
and
had
thrown
away
the
paper
with
the
casual
cruelty
of
an
she
had
judged
him
to
offer
her
his
love
which
she
had
always
known
was
more
difficult
gift
than
money
perhaps
the
truth
was
that
she
hadn
been
worthy
to
receive
it
for
over
thirty
years
she
had
her
contempt
her
resentment
and
yes
her
hatred
but
that
stream
that
lonely
death
had
put
him
out
of
her
power
for
ever
it
was
herself
she
had
and
to
this
might
be
the
beginning
of
her
mother
said
it
never
too
late
to
find
someone
to
love
you
re
handsome
woman
rhoda
you
should
do
something
about
that
scar
words
she
had
never
expected
to
hear
words
which
no
one
since
miss
had
dared
to
speak
she
remembered
little
of
what
happened
afterwards
only
her
own
reply
spoken
quietly
and
without
shall
get
rid
of
it
she
must
have
now
she
woke
into
full
consciousness
with
start
to
find
that
the
rain
had
passed
darkness
had
fallen
glancing
at
the
she
saw
that
it
was
four
fifty
five
she
had
been
on
the
road
for
nearly
three
hours
in
the
unexpected
quiet
the
noise
of
the
engine
as
she
from
the
verge
the
silent
air
the
rest
of
the
journey
was
easy
the
of
the
road
came
where
expected
and
her
on
the
lit
up
names
sooner
than
expected
she
saw
the
name
stoke
cheverell
and
turned
right
for
the
final
mile
the
village
street
was
deserted
lights
shone
behind
drawn
curtains
and
only
the
corner
shop
with
its
bright
crowded
window
through
which
two
or
three
late
could
be
seen
showed
signs
of
life
and
now
there
was
the
sign
she
was
looking
for
cheverell
manor
the
great
iron
gates
stood
open
she
was
expected
she
drove
down
the
short
avenue
which
into
half
circle
and
the
house
was
before
her
there
had
been
picture
of
cheverell
manor
in
the
handed
to
her
after
her
first
but
it
was
only
pale
coloured
of
the
reality
in
her
she
saw
the
of
the
house
seeming
larger
than
she
had
expected
dark
mass
against
the
darker
sky
it
stretched
each
side
of
large
central
with
two
windows
above
these
showed
pale
light
but
most
were
except
for
four
large
windows
to
the
left
of
the
door
which
were
brightly
lit
as
she
drove
carefully
and
parked
under
the
trees
the
door
opened
and
strong
light
out
over
the
off
the
engine
she
got
out
and
opened
the
back
door
for
her
overnight
case
the
cold
damp
air
welcome
release
after
the
drive
male
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
moved
towards
her
although
the
rain
had
stopped
he
was
wearing
plastic
with
that
reached
over
his
head
like
baby
giving
him
the
look
of
child
he
walked
firmly
and
his
voice
was
strong
but
she
could
see
that
he
was
no
longer
young
he
took
the
case
firmly
from
her
and
said
if
you
give
me
the
key
ll
park
the
car
for
you
miss
cressett
doesn
like
to
see
cars
parked
outside
they
re
expecting
you
she
handed
over
the
key
and
followed
him
into
the
house
the
unease
the
slight
sense
of
she
had
felt
sitting
alone
in
the
was
still
with
her
drained
of
emotion
she
felt
only
mild
relief
at
having
arrived
and
as
she
passed
into
the
wide
hall
with
its
central
staircase
she
was
aware
of
need
to
be
again
relieved
of
the
necessity
of
shaking
hands
of
formal
welcome
when
all
she
wanted
was
the
silence
of
her
own
home
and
later
the
familiar
comfort
of
her
bed
the
entrance
hall
was
impressive
she
had
expected
it
to
be
but
it
was
not
her
suitcase
was
placed
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
then
opening
door
to
the
left
the
man
announced
loudly
miss
gradwyn
miss
cressett
and
picking
up
her
suitcase
made
for
the
stairs
she
entered
the
room
and
found
herself
in
great
hall
which
brought
back
pictures
seen
perhaps
in
childhood
or
on
visits
to
other
country
houses
after
the
darkness
outside
it
was
full
of
light
and
colour
high

with
age

covered
the
lower
part
of

in

above
it
wood
fire
was
in
the
grate
the
dancing
flames
over
the
three
figures
who
rose
to
meet
her
they
had
obviously
been
sitting
having
tea
the
two
linen
covered
armchairs
set
at
right
angles
to
the
fire
the
only
modern
furniture
in
the
room
between
them
low
table
held
tray
with
the
remains
of
the
meal
the
party
of
man
and
two
women
although
the
word
welcome
was
hardly
appropriate
since
she
felt
like
an
intruder
inconveniently
late
for
tea
and
without
enthusiasm
the
taller
of
the
two
women
made
the
she
said
helena
cressett
we
have
spoken
glad
you
ve
got
here
safely
we
ve
had
bad
but
sometimes
they

very
local

may
flavia

sister
and
marcus
westhall
who
will
assist
mr
chandler

with
your
operation
they
shook
hands
faces
into
smiles
rhoda
impression
of
new
people
was
always
immediate
and
strong
image
on
her
mind
never
to
be
totally
bringing
with
it
of
character
which
time
and
closer
might
as
she
knew
be
shown
to
be
and
sometimes
but
which
rarely
was
now
tired
her
little
she
saw
them
almost
as
helena
cressett
in
well
suit
with
which
avoided
looking
too
for
wearing
in
the
country
while
that
it
hadn
been
bought
off

make
up

for
lipstick
fine
pale
hair
with
hint
of
high
cheekbones
nose
little
too
long
for
beauty
face
one
might
describe
as
handsome
but
certainly
not
pretty
grey
eyes
regarded
her
with
more
curiosity
than
formal
rhoda
thought
head
girl
now
headmistress
or
more
probably
of
an
college
her
was
firm
the
new
girl
being
welcomed
with
all
judgement
sister
holland
was
less
formally
dressed
in
jeans
black
and
comfort
clothes
that
she
had
been
released
from
the
impersonal
uniform
of
her
job
and
was
now
off
duty
she
was
dark
haired
with
face
that
conveyed
confident
her
glance
from
bright
large
eyes
so
dark
that
they
were
almost
black
took
in
the
scar
as
if
mentally
how
much
trouble
could
be
expected
from
this
new
patient
mr
westhall
was
surprising
he
was
slightly
built
with
high
forehead
and
sensitive
face
the
face
of
poet
or
academic
rather
than
surgeon
she
felt
none
of
the
power
or
confidence
which
had
so
strongly
from
mr
chandler
powell
his
smile
was
than
those
of
the
women
but
his
hand
despite
the
warmth
of
the
fire
was
cold
helena
cressett
said
you
must
be
ready
for
tea
or
perhaps
for
something
stronger
would
you
like
it
here
or
in
your
own
sitting
room
either
way
ll
take
you
there
now
so
that
you
can
settle
in
rhoda
said
that
she
would
prefer
to
have
tea
in
her
room
they
mounted
the
broad
uncarpeted
stairs
together
and
passed
down
corridor
lined
with
and
what
looked
like
earlier
pictures
of
the
house
rhoda
suitcase
had
been
placed
outside
door
down
the
patients
corridor
picking
it
up
miss
cressett
opened
the
door
and
stood
aside
as
rhoda
entered
the
two
rooms
to
her
were
shown
to
her
by
miss
cressett
rather
she
thought
as
might
briefly
the
of
hotel
suite
routine
too
often
to
be
more
than
duty
rhoda
saw
that
the
sitting
room
was
both
agreeable
in
its
and
furnished
obviously
in
period
furniture
most
of
it
looked
there
was
mahogany
with
desk
large
enough
for
comfortable
writing
the
only
modern
furniture
were
the
two
armchairs
before
the
fireplace
and
tall
reading
lamp
beside
one
of
them
to
the
left
of
the
fire
there
was
modern
television
on
stand
with
player
on
shelf
beneath
it
an
but
presumably
necessary
to
room
which
was
both
distinctive
and
they
moved
next
door
here
was
the
same
elegance
with
any
suggestion
of
miss
cressett
placed
rhoda
suitcase
on
folding
stand
then
walking
over
to
the
window
drew
the
curtains
she
said
at
present

too
dark
to
see
anything
but

then
now
if
you
have
everything
you
want
ll
send
up
the
tea
and
the

breakfast
tomorrow
if

rather
than

it
in
your
room
dinner

eight
clock
but

and
then
she
was
gone
but
for
now
rhoda
had
seen
enough
of
cheverell
manor
and
hadn
the
energy
to
in
the
to
and
of
dinner
conversation
she
would
request
dinner
in
her
room
and
have
an
early
night
gradually
she
took
possession
of
room
to
which
she
already
knew
she
would
return
in
just
over
two
weeks
time
without
or
apprehension
it
was
six
forty
on
the
same
tuesday
before
george
chandler
powell
had
finished
his
list
of
private
patients
at
st
angela
hospital
pulling
off
his
operating
gown
he
felt
both
exhausted
and
restless
he
had
started
early
and
worked
without
break
which
was
unusual
but
necessary
if
he
were
to
get
through
his
london
list
of
private
patients
before
leaving
for
his
christmas
holiday
in
new
since
his
early
childhood
christmas
had
become
horror
to
him
and
he
never
spent
it
in
england
his
wife
now
married
to
an
well
able
to
maintain
her
in
the
state
both
she
and
he
regarded
as
reasonable
for
very
beautiful
woman
held
strong
views
about
the
necessity
of
all
being
what
she
described
as
chandler
powell
suspected
that
the
word
applied
to
the
or
otherwise
of
the
financial
but
with
the
fortune
secured
she
had
been
able
to
the
public
appearance
of
for
the
more
satisfaction
of
gain
they
liked
seeing
each
other
once
year
and
he
enjoyed
new
and
the
programme
of
and
her
husband
for
him
he
never
stayed
longer
than
week
before
to
where
he
stayed
in
the
same
outside
the
city
he
had
first
visited
when
at
oxford
was
quietly
welcomed
and
saw
no
one
but
the
annual
visit
to
new
had
become
habit
and
one
which
at
present
he
saw
no
reason
to
break
he
was
not
due
to
arrive
at
the
manor
until
wednesday
night
for
the
first
operating
session
on
thursday
morning
but
two
had
that
morning
been
closed
because
of
and
the
next
day
list
had
had
to
be
now
back
in
his
flat
and
looking
out
at
the
lights
of
the
city
the
wait
seemed
interminable
he
needed
to
get
out
of
london
to
sit
in
the
great
hall
at
the
manor
before
wood
fire
to
walk
in
the
lime
avenue
to
breathe
less
cluttered
air
with
the
taste
of
wood
smoke
earth
and
leaves
on
the
breeze
he
flung
what
he
needed
for
the
next
few
days
into
grip
with
the
careless
of
schoolboy
released
for
the
holidays
and
too
impatient
to
wait
for
the
lift
ran
down
the
stairs
to
the
garage
and
his
waiting
there
was
the
usual
problem
getting
free
of
the
city
but
once
on
the
motorway
the
pleasure
and
relief
of
movement
took
over
as
it
invariably
did
when
he
drove
alone
at
night
and
thoughts
of
the
past
like
series
of
brown
and
photographs
came
to
mind
he
of
in
minor
into
the
player
and
with
his
hands
lightly
on
the
wheel
let
the
music
and
the
memories
in
calm
on
his
birthday
he
had
come
to
about
three
matters
which
from
childhood
had
increasingly
his
thoughts
he
decided
that
god
didn
exist
that
he
didn
love
his
parents
and
that
he
would
become
surgeon
the
first
required
no
action
on
his
part
merely
the
acceptance
that
since
neither
help
nor
comfort
could
be
expected
from
being
his
life
was
subject
like
any
other
to
time
and
chance
and
that
it
was
up
to
him
to
take
such
control
as
he
could
the
second
required
little
more
of
him
and
when
with
some
embarrassment
and
on
his
mother
part
some
shame
they
broke
the
news
to
him
that
they
were
thinking
of
divorce
he
expressed
regret
that
seemed
only
proper
while
subtly
them
to
end
marriage
that
was
obviously
for
all
three
of
them
the
school
holidays
would
be
great
deal
more
pleasant
if
not
by
or
when
they
were
killed
in
road
accident
while
on
holiday
planned
in
the
hope
of
fresh
start
there
had
been
several
such
he
was
visited
for
moment
by
fear
that
there
might
be
power
as
strong
as
the
one
he
had
rejected
but
more
and
possessed
of
certain
humour
before
telling
himself
that
it
was
to
benign
in
favour
of
one
less
possibly
even
his
third
conclusion
remained
as
an
ambition
he
would
on
the
facts
of
and
concentrate
on
becoming
surgeon
his
parents
had
left
him
little
but
their
that
hardly
mattered
he
had
always
spent
most
of
his
summer
holidays
with
his
grandfather
in
bournemouth
and
now
this
became
his
home
as
far
as
he
was
capable
of
strong
human
affection
it
was
chandler
powell
that
he
loved
he
would
have
been
fond
of
him
even
had
the
old
man
been
poor
but
was
glad
that
he
was
rich
he
had
made
fortune
by
talent
for
elegant
and
original
cardboard
boxes
it
became
for
company
to
its
goods
in
chandler
powell
for
to
be
wrapped
in
box
with
the
distinctive
discovered
and
new
young
and
some
of
the
boxes
in
limited
numbers
became
his
firm
needed
no
advertisement
beyond
the
goods
they
produced
when
he
was
sixty
five
and
george
was
ten
he
sold
the
business
to
his
largest
and
retired
with
his
it
was
he
who
paid
for
george
expensive
education
saw
him
through
oxford
required
nothing
in
return
but
his
company
in
the
holidays
from
school
and
university
and
later
for
three
or
four
visits
year
for
george
these
had
never
been
an
walking
or
driving
together
he
would
listen
to
his
grandfather
voice
stories
of
his
depressed
childhood
the
oxford
years
before
george
himself
went
up
to
oxford
his
grandfather
had
been
more
specific
now
that
remembered
voice
strong
and
authoritative
broke
through
the
high
trembling
beauty
of
the
was
school
boy
you
see
there
on
county
difficult
for
you
to
understand
things
may
be
different
now
although
doubt
it
not
that
different
wasn
or
despised
or
made
to
feel
different
just
was
different
never
felt
belonged
there
and
of
course
didn
knew
from
the
first
that
had
no
right
to
be
there
that
something
in
the
air
of
those
rejected
me
wasn
the
only
one
to
feel
that
of
course
there
were
boys
not
from
schools
but
from
the
less
public
schools
places
they
tried
not
to
mention
could
see
it
they
were
the
ones
to
be
admitted
to
that
golden
group
of
the
privileged
upper
class
used
to
imagine
them
their
way
with
and
talent
into
the
hill
academic
dinner
parties
like
court
at
the
country
weekend
parties
offering
their
pathetic
their
and
their
to
buy
their
way
in
hadn
any
talent
except
despised
them
but
knew
what
they
respected
all
of
them
money
my
boy
that
what
mattered
was
important
but
with
money
was
better
and
made
money
it
will
come
to
you
in
time
what
left
after
government
has
its
make
good
use
of
it
was
visiting
open
to
the
public
to
them
by
carefully
devised
with
the
aid
of
driving
his
immaculate
rolls
as
upright
as
the
victorian
general
he
resembled
he
travelled
down
country
and
little
used
george
at
his
side
reading
aloud
from
the
he
thought
it
strange
that
man
so
to
elegance
and
tudor
solidity
should
live
in
in
bournemouth
even
if
the
sea
view
was
in
time
he
came
to
understand
why
his
grandfather
approaching
old
age
had
his
life
he
was
looked
after
by
paid
cook
housekeeper
and
general
who
came
in
by
the
day
did
their
work
and
quietly
and
left
his
furniture
was
expensive
but
he
neither
collected
nor
the
which
were
his
enthusiasm
he
could
without
wanting
to
george
from
an
early
age
knew
himself
to
be
and
the
first
time
they
visited
cheverell
manor
he
knew
that
this
was
the
house
he
wanted
it
lay
before
him
in
the
sunshine
of
an
early
day
when
the
shadows
were
beginning
to
and
trees
and
stone
took
on
of
colour
from
the
dying
sun
so
that
there
seemed
only
moment
in
which
everything
the
house
gardens
the
great
wrought
iron
gates
were
held
in
calm
almost
of
light
form
and
colours
which
caught
at
his
heart
at
the
end
of
their
visit
turning
to
take
last
look
he
said
want
to
buy
that
house
well
one
day
george
perhaps
you
will
but
people
don
sell
houses
like
that
wouldn
most
don
some
may
have
to
but
why
grandfather
the
money
out
they
can
afford
to
maintain
it
the
makes
in
the
city
and
has
no
interest
in
his
or
the
may
be
killed
in
war
the
landed
class
have
for
getting
themselves
killed
in
or
the
house
is
lost
through
women
drink
drugs
speculation
you
never
know
and
in
the
end
it
had
been
the
owner
that
had
gained
george
the
house
sir
cressett
was
ruined
in
the
lloyd
disaster
george
only
knew
that
the
house
was
coming
on
the
market
by
upon
an
article
in
financial
broadsheet
about
the
lloyd
names
who
had
suffered
the
most
and
cressett
was
among
them
he
couldn
remember
now
who
had
written
it
some
woman
with
name
for
investigative
it
had
not
been
kind
article
more
on
and
than
on
ill
luck
he
had
moved
quickly
and
acquired
the
manor
driving
hard
knowing
exactly
what
he
wanted
included
in
the
sale
the
best
pictures
had
been
for
but
he
wasn
for
those
it
was
the
contents
which
had
caught
his
eye
as
boy
on
that
first
visit
that
he
was
determined
to
collect
among
them
queen
anne
armchair
he
had
been
moving
little
ahead
of
his
grandfather
into
the
dining
room
and
had
seen
the
chair
he
was
sitting
on
it
when
girl
plain
serious
child
who
looked
no
more
than
six
years
old
wearing
and
an
open
necked
shirt
came
up
and
said
aggressively
you
re
not
allowed
to
sit
on
that
chair
then
you
ought
to
have
round
it
there
should
be
there
usually
is
well
there
isn
now
after
five
seconds
of
silent
staring
george
stood
up
without
speaking
she
the
chair
with
surprising
ease
over
the
white
the
dining
room
from
the
narrow
strip
available
for
visitors
to
walk
and
sat
firmly
down
her
legs
dangling
then
stared
at
him
as
if
challenging
him
to
object
she
said
what
your
name
george
what
yours
helena
live
here
you
re
not
supposed
to
cross
over
the
white
didn
the
chair
was
on
this
side
the
encounter
was
too
boring
to
be
lengthened
the
child
too
young
and
too
plain
to
interest
he
had
his
shoulders
and
moved
away
and
now
the
chair
was
in
his
study
and
helena
cressett
was
his
housekeeper
and
if
she
remembered
that
first
childhood
encounter
she
never
mentioned
it
and
nor
did
he
he
had
used
the
whole
of
his
grandfather
to
the
manor
and
had
planned
to
maintain
it
by
the
west
wing
into
private
clinic
spending
from
monday
to
wednesday
each
week
in
london
operating
on
his
patients
and
those
in
his
private
beds
at
st
angela
and
returning
to
stoke
cheverell
on
wednesday
nights
the
work
of
the
wing
was
done
the
changes
the
wing
was
century
following
an
earlier
replacement
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
no
other
original
part
of
the
manor
had
been
touched
the
clinic
had
never
been
problem
he
knew
whom
he
wanted
and
was
prepared
to
pay
over
the
odds
to
get
them
but
the
operating
suite
had
proved
easier
than
the
manor
the
months
while
he
planning
consent
and
when
the
work
was
in
progress
presented
no
problem
he
in
the
manor
often
with
the
house
to
himself
looked
after
by
an
elderly
cook
the
only
member
of
the
cressett
staff
apart
from
the
mogworthy
who
stayed
on
he
looked
back
now
on
that
year
as
one
of
the
most
and
that
he
had
ever
known
he
in
his
possession
moving
daily
in
the
silence
from
the
great
hall
to
the
library
from
the
long
gallery
to
his
rooms
in
the
east
wing
with
quiet
triumph
he
knew
that
the
manor
couldn
hope
to
the
great
hall
or
the
gardens
of
the
beauty
of
the
setting
of
or
the
and
history
of
dorset
was
rich
in
great
houses
but
this
was
his
place
and
he
wanted
no
other
the
problems
began
after
the
clinic
had
opened
and
the
first
patients
arrived
he
for
housekeeper
but
as
in
need
had
none
proved
the
old
from
the
village
whose
had
worked
for
the
were
not
from
old
by
the
high
wages
offered
by
the
he
had
thought
that
his
secretary
in
london
would
have
time
to
cope
with
the
bills
and
she
hadn
he
had
hoped
that
mogworthy
the
now
relieved
by
an
expensive
firm
who
came
in
to
cope
with
the
heavy
work
would
to
help
more
in
the
house
he
wouldn
but
the
second
advertisement
for
housekeeper
this
time
differently
placed
and
had
produced
helena
she
had
he
remembered
interviewed
him
rather
than
he
her
she
said
that
she
was
recently
divorced
independent
with
flat
in
london
but
wanted
something
to
do
while
she
considered
her
future
it
would
be
interesting
to
return
even
temporarily
to
the
manor
she
had
returned
six
years
ago
and
was
still
there
occasionally
he
wondered
how
he
would
manage
when
she
decided
to
leave
which
she
would
probably
do
as
and
as
she
had
arrived
but
he
was
too
busy
there
were
problems
some
of
his
own
making
with
the
theatre
sister
flavia
holland
and
with
his
assistant
surgeon
marcus
westhall
and
although
by
nature
he
had
never
seen
sense
in
helena
had
her
old
frensham
as
she
was
presumably
either
widow
or
divorced
or
separated
but
he
made
no
enquiry
the
were
kept
in
the
office
order
was
produced
out
of
mogworthy
ceased
his
irritating
threats
to
and
became
part
time
staff
from
the
village
became
available
helena
said
that
no
good
cook
would
the
kitchen
and
he
provided
the
money
required
for
its
were
lit
flowers
and
found
for
the
rooms
in
use
even
in
the
winter
the
manor
became
alive
when
he
drew
up
at
the
locked
gates
and
got
out
of
the
to
open
them
he
saw
that
the
avenue
to
the
house
was
in
darkness
but
as
he
drove
past
the
east
wing
to
park
lights
came
on
and
he
was
greeted
at
the
open
front
door
by
the
cook
dean
bostock
he
was
wearing
checked
blue
trousers
and
his
short
white
jacket
as
was
usual
when
he
expected
to
serve
dinner
he
said
miss
cressett
and
mrs
frensham
went
out
for
dinner
sir
they
said
to
tell
you
they
were
visiting
some
friends
in
your
room

ready
sir
mogworthy
has
lit
the
fire
in
the
library
as
well
as
in
the
great
hall
we
thought
being
alone
you
might
prefer
to
have
dinner
served
there
shall
bring
in
the
drinks
sir
they
moved
through
the
great
hall
chandler
powell
off
his
jacket
and
opening
the
library
door
threw
it
and
his
evening
paper
on
chair
yes

it
now
and
dinner
in
half
an
hour
yes
that
ll
be
fine
you

be
going
out
before

sir
there
was
note
of
anxiety
in
dean
voice
the
cause
chandler
powell
said
so
what
is
it
you
and
kimberley
have
cooked
between
you
we
thought
sir
and
see
the
first
me
to
be
sitting
waiting
for
it
and
the
second
is
quickly
cooked
no
be
going
out
dean
the
dinner
as
usual
was
excellent
he
wondered
why
he
should
so
look
forward
to
his
meals
when
the
manor
was
at
its
during
his
operating
days
when
he
ate
with
the
medical
and
nursing
staff
he
hardly
noticed
what
was
on
his
plate
after
dinner
he
sat
and
read
for
half
an
hour
beside
the
library
fire
then
fetching
his
jacket
and
torch
went
out
by
the
door
in
the
west
wing
and
it
and
then
walked
in
the
star
darkness
down
the
lime
avenue
to
the
pale
circle
of
the
cheverell
stones
low
wall
more
landmark
than
separated
the
manor
garden
from
the
stone
circle
and
he
himself
over
without
difficulty
as
usual
after
dark
the
circle
of
twelve
stones
seemed
to
become
more
mysterious
and
more
impressive
even
to
take
on
faint
from
the
or
stars
seeing
them
in
daylight
they
were
of
ordinary
stone
as
commonplace
as
any
large
seen
on
in
size
and
oddly
shaped
their
only
distinction
the
highly
coloured
in
the
note
on
the
door
of
the
beside
the
parking
space
visitors
that
the
stones
were
not
to
be
stood
on
or
and
explained
that
the
was
both
old
and
interesting
and
should
not
be
touched
to
chandler
powell
approaching
the
circle
even
the
central
stone
standing
as
an
evil
in
its
ring
of
dead
grass
little
emotion
he
thought
briefly
of
the
long
dead
woman
bound
to
this
stone
in
and
burnt
alive
as
witch
and
for
what
an
over
sharp
tongue
mental
to
private
the
need
for
in
times
of
or
the
failure
of
or
perhaps
as
sacrifice
to
god
he
felt
only
vague
unfocused
pity
not
strong
enough
to
cause
even
of
distress
she
was
only
one
of
who
down
the
ages
had
been
the
innocent
victims
of
the
and
cruelty
of
he
saw
enough
pain
in
his
world
he
had
no
need
to
pity
he
had
intended
to
his
walk
beyond
the
circle
but
decided
that
this
should
be
the
limit
of
his
exercise
and
sitting
on
the
stone
gazed
along
the
avenue
to
the
west
wing
of
the
manor
now
in
darkness
he
sat
absolutely
still
listening
to
the
noises
of
the
night
the
small
in
the
high
on
the
fringe
of
the
stones
distant
scream
as
some
found
its
the
of
the
leaves
as
breeze
suddenly
the
petty
and
of
the
long
day
fell
away
here
in
no
alien
place
he
sat
so
motionless
that
even
his
breathing
seemed
no
more
than
an
softly
of
life
time
passed
glancing
at
his
watch
he
saw
that
he
had
been
sitting
there
for
three
of
an
hour
he
became
aware
that
he
was
getting
chilled
that
the
of
the
stone
was
becoming
uncomfortable
his
legs
he
the
wall
and
entered
the
lime
walk
suddenly
light
appeared
in
the
middle
window
of
the
patients
floor
the
window
was
opened
and
woman
head
appeared
she
stood
motionless
looking
out
into
the
night
he
stopped
walking
and
stared
at
her
both
so
motionless
that
for
moment
he
could
believe
that
she
could
see
him
and
that
some
was
passing
between
them
he
remembered
whom
she
was
rhoda
gradwyn
and
that
she
was
at
the
manor
for
her
preliminary
stay
despite
his
note
taking
and
examination
of
patients
before
operating
few
of
them
remained
in
mind
he
could
have
described
the
scar
on
her
face
but
remembered
little
else
about
her
except
for
one
sentence
she
had
come
to
get
rid
of
the
because
she
no
longer
had
need
of
it
he
had
asked
for
no
explanation
and
she
had
offered
none
and
in
just
over
two
weeks
she
would
be
rid
of
it
and
how
she
would
cope
with
its
absence
would
not
be
his
concern
he
turned
to
walk
back
to
the
house
and
as
he
did
hand
half
closed
the
window
the
curtains
were
partly
drawn
and
few
minutes
later
the
light
in
the
room
went
out
and
the
west
wing
was
in
darkness
dean
bostock
always
felt
lift
of
the
heart
when
mr
chandler
powell
phoned
to
say
that
he
would
be
arriving
unexpectedly
early
in
the
week
and
would
be
at
the
manor
in
time
for
dinner
this
was
meal
dean
enjoyed
particularly
when
the
boss
had
time
and
peace
to
enjoy
and
mr
chandler
powell
brought
with
him
something
of
the
energy
and
excitement
of
the
capital
its
its
lights
the
sense
of
being
at
the
heart
of
things
arriving
he
would
almost
bound
through
the
great
hall
strip
off
his
jacket
and
the
london
evening
paper
on
to
library
chair
as
if
released
from
temporary
but
even
the
paper
which
dean
would
later
to
read
at
was
for
him
reminder
of
where
essentially
he
dean
belonged
he
had
been
born
and
brought
up
in
london
was
his
place
kim
was
country
born
coming
to
the
capital
from
to
begin
her
training
at
the
school
where
he
had
been
second
year
student
and
within
two
weeks
of
their
first
meeting
he
had
known
that
he
loved
her
that
was
how
he
had
always
thought
of
it
he
hadn
fallen
in
love
he
wasn
in
love
he
loved
this
was
for
life
his
life
and
hers
and
now
for
the
first
time
since
their
marriage
he
knew
that
she
was
happier
than
she
ever
been
how
could
he
miss
london
while
kim
in
her
dorset
life
she
who
was
so
nervous
of
new
people
and
new
places
felt
no
fear
in
the
dark
winter
nights
the
total
blackness
of
nights
and
frightened
him
nights
made
more
terrifying
by
the
half
human
of
in
the
of
their
this
beautiful
and
apparently
was
full
of
pain
he
missed
the
lights
the
night
sky
by
the
grey
purple
and
of
the
city
life
the
changing
pattern
of
traffic
lights
light
from
and
shops
over
glittering
rain
washed
life
movement
noise
london
he
liked
his
job
at
the
manor
but
it
didn
him
it
made
so
few
on
his
skill
mr
chandler
powell
was
about
food
but
on
his
operating
days
meals
were
never
lingered
over
dean
knew
he
would
have
complained
soon
enough
had
the
meal
been
below
standard
but
he
took
its
for
granted
ate
it
quickly
and
was
gone
the
westhalls
usually
took
meals
in
their
cottage
where
miss
westhall
had
been
caring
for
their
elderly
father
until
his
death
in
and
miss
cressett
usually
ate
in
her
own
apartment
but
she
was
the
only
one
who
spent
time
in
the
kitchen
talking
to
kim
and
him
discussing
him
for
special
efforts
made
the
visitors
were
but
usually
not
hungry
and
the
non
resident
staff
who
ate
the
midday
meal
at
the
manor
him
ate
quickly
and
returned
to
work
it
was
all
so
different
from
his
dream
of
his
own
restaurant
his
his
customers
the
which
he
and
kim
would
occasionally
lying
beside
her
he
would
himself
with
half
expressed
that
somehow
the
clinic
would
fail
that
mr
chandler
powell
would
find
it
too
and
not
enough
to
work
in
both
london
and
dorset
that
he
and
kim
would
have
to
look
for
another
job
and
perhaps
mr
chandler
powell
or
miss
cressett
would
help
them
to
gain
but
they
couldn
return
to
work
in
the
kitchen
of
london
restaurant
kim
would
never
be
to
that
life
he
remembered
still
with
horror
that
awful
day
on
which
she
had
been
mr
had
called
him
into
the
cupboard
sized
at
the
rear
of
the
kitchen
which
he
by
the
name
of
office
and
had
squeezed
his
into
the
carved
desk
chair
inherited
from
his
grandfather
it
was
never
good
sign
here
was
with
authority
year
previously
he
had
announced
that
he
had
been
born
again
it
had
been
uncomfortable
for
the
staff
and
there
had
been
general
relief
when
within
nine
months
the
old
adam
had
himself
and
the
kitchen
was
no
longer
swear
free
but
one
of
the
new
birth
remained
no
word
stronger
than
bloody
was
permitted
and
now
himself
had
made
free
use
of
it
it
no
bloody
use
dean
kimberley
got
to
go
frankly
can
afford
her
no
restaurant

talk
about

to
hurry

when

when
they
were
established
and
she

the
kitchen

baby

longed
for

kitchen

dean
had
found
his
voice
cracked
with
its
note
of
we
ve
always
planned
to
work
together
don
know
that
kim
would
like
to

sorry

but
there
it

small
town
in
the
country
maybe
she
pretty
nice
few
home
made
afternoon
served
with
that
kind
of
thing
that
wouldn
her
the
note
of
contempt
in
his
voice
had
been
like
across
the
face
dean
wished
he
wasn
standing
there
vulnerable
diminished
that
there
was
chair
back
something
solid
that
he
could
grip
to
help
control
this
of
anger
resentment
and
despair
but
was
right
that
to
the
office
hadn
been
unexpected
he
had
been
it
for
months
he
made
one
more
appeal
he
said
like
to
stay
on
at
least
until
we
find
somewhere
to
go
me
haven
told
you
you
ve
got
the
of
bloody
good
of
course
he
would
stay
on
the
restaurant
plan
might
be
but
they
had
to
eat
kim
had
left
at
the
end
of
the
week
and
it
was
two
weeks
later
to
the
day
that
they
saw
the
advertisement
for
married
couple
cook
and
assistant
cook
at
cheverell
manor
the
day
of
the
interview
had
been
tuesday
in
of
the
previous
year
they
had
been
to
take
train
from
to
wareham
where
they
would
be
met
looking
back
it
seemed
to
dean
that
they
had
travelled
in
being
borne
onwards
with
no
consent
of
will
through
and
to
distant
and
future
looking
at
kim
against
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
and
later
the
green
fields
and
hedges
beyond
he
longed
for
this
extraordinary
day
to
end
well
he
hadn
since
childhood
but
found
himself
silently
the
same
desperate
please
god
make
it
all
right
please
don
let
her
be
disappointed
turning
to
him
as
they
approached
wareham
she
said
you
ve
got
the
safe
darling
she
had
asked
about
them
every
hour
at
wareham
was
waiting
in
the
with
elderly
man
at
the
wheel
he
didn
get
out
but
them
over
he
said
you
ll
be
the
bostocks
thinking
my
name
mogworthy
no
no
there
wouldn
be
would
there
you
ll
not
be
staying
climb
in
the
back
then
it
wasn
thought
dean
propitious
welcome
but
that
hardly
mattered
when
the
air
smelled
so
sweet
and
they
were
being
driven
through
such
beauty
it
was
perfect
summer
day
the
sky
and
through
the
open
windows
of
the
breeze
fell
on
their
faces
not
strong
enough
even
to
stir
the
delicate
of
the
trees
or
the
the
trees
were
in
full
still
with
the
of
spring
their
not
yet
with
the
dusty
of
it
was
kim
who
after
ten
minutes
of
silent
drive
leaned
forward
and
said
do
you
work
at
cheverell
manor
mr
mogworthy
ve
been
there
for
just
on
forty
five
years
started
as
boy
in
the
grounds
the
knot
garden
still
do
sir
was
the
owner
then
and
after
him
sir
you
ll
be
working
for
mr
chandler
powell
now
if
the
women
take
you
on
won
he
be
us
asked
dean
he
ll
be
in
london
he
there
on
and
miss
cressett
and
sister
holland
will
be
you
mr
chandler
powell
doesn
bother
himself
with
domestic
matters
the
women
and
you
re
in
if
not
pack
your
bags
and
you
re
out
it
had
not
been
beginning
and
on
first
sight
even
the
beauty
of
the
manor
standing
silent
and
in
the
summer
sun
was
more
intimidating
than
mogworthy
left
them
at
the
front
door
merely
pointing
at
the
bell
then
returned
to
the
and
drove
it
round
the
east
wing
of
the
house
dean
tugged
on
the
iron
bell
pull
they
heard
no
sound
but
within
half
minute
the
door
opened
and
they
saw
young
woman
she
had
shoulder
length
blonde
hair
which
dean
thought
looked
none
too
clean
heavily
applied
lipstick
and
wore
jeans
beneath
coloured
apron
he
put
her
down
as
someone
from
the
village
who
helped
out
first
impression
which
proved
right
she
regarded
them
with
some
for
moment
then
said
miss
cressett
said
to
give
you
tea
in
the
great
hall
now
recalling
the
arrival
dean
was
surprised
that
he
had
become
so
used
to
the
of
the
great
hall
he
could
understand
now
how
people
who
owned
such
house
could
get
used
to
its
beauty
could
move
down
its
corridors
and
through
its
rooms
hardly
noticing
the
pictures
and
the
which
them
he
smiled
remembering
how
after
asking
if
they
could
wash
their
hands
they
had
been
led
through
the
hall
to
room
at
the
back
which
was
obviously
lavatory
and
had
disappeared
and
he
waited
outside
while
kim
went
in
first
three
minutes
later
she
was
out
eyes
wide
with
surprise
saying
in
whisper
it
so
strange
the
lavatory
bowl
is
painted
inside
it
all
blue
with
flowers
and
and
the
seat
is
huge
it
mahogany
and
there
no
proper
flush
at
all
you
have
to
pull
on
chain
like
you
do
in
my
gran
the
lovely
though
and
there
are
of
didn
know
which
to
use
expensive
soap
too
hurry
up
darling
don
want
to
be
left
alone
do
you
suppose
the
is
as
old
as
the
house
it
must
be
no
he
said
wanting
to
knowledge
there
wouldn
have
been
any
when
this
house
was
built
not
like
that
anyway
it
sounds
more
victorian
early
century
say
he
spoke
with
confidence
he
didn
feel
determined
not
to
let
the
manor
him
it
was
to
him
kim
looked
for
reassurance
and
support
he
mustn
show
that
he
needed
them
himself
returning
to
the
hallway
they
found
at
the
door
of
the
great
hall
she
said
your
tea
in
here
ll
come
back
in
quarter
of
an
hour
and
take
you
to
the
office
at
first
the
great
hall
them
and
they
moved
forward
like
children
beneath
the
huge
under
the
gaze
or
so
it
seemed
of
in
and
and
young
posed
with
their
by
the
size
and
it
was
only
later
that
he
noticed
details
now
he
was
aware
of
the
great
on
the
right
wall
and
beneath
it
long
oak
table
holding
huge
of
flowers
the
tea
was
waiting
for
them
set
out
on
low
table
before
the
fireplace
they
saw
an
elegant
tea
service
plate
of
sandwiches
with
and
and
fruit
they
were
both
kim
poured
the
tea
with
shaking
fingers
while
dean
having
already
had
of
sandwiches
on
the
train
took
and
it
with
and
after
he
said
the
home
made
the
isn
that
bad
kim
said
the
bought
too
rather
good
though
but
it
makes
me
wonder
when
the
last
cook
left
don
think
we
want
to
give
them
bought
and
that
girl
who
opened
the
door
she
must
be
can
see
them
taking
on
someone
like
that
they
found
themselves
whispering
to
each
other
like
returned
promptly
still
unsmiling
she
said
rather
will
you
follow
me
please
and
led

hall
to
the
opposite
door
opened
it
and
said
the
bostocks
are
here
miss
cressett
ve
given
them
tea
and
disappeared
the
room
was
small
oak
panelled
and
obviously
highly
the
large
desk
in
contrast
to
the
linen
fold
and
the
row
of
smaller
pictures
above
it
three
women
were
seated
at
the
desk
and
them
to
the
chairs
set
ready

taller

helena
cressett
and

is
sister
holland

mrs
frensham

comfortable
journey
dean
said
very
comfortable
thank
you
good
you
ll
need
to
see
your
accommodation
and
the
kitchen
before
you
make
up
your
mind
but
first
we
would
like
to
explain
about
the
job
in
some
ways
it
very
different
from
the
usual
work
of
cook
mr
chandler
powell
in
london
from
monday
to
wednesday
that
means
that
the
beginning
of
each
week
will
be
comparatively
easy
for
you
his
assistant
mr
marcus
westhall
lives
in
one
of
the
cottages
with
his
sister
and
his
father
and
usually
cook
for
myself
in
my
flat
here
although
may
from
time
to
time
have
small
dinner
party
and
ask
you
to
cook
for
me
the
second
half
of
the
week
will
be
very
busy
the
anaesthetist
and
all
the
additional
nursing
and
staff
will
be
here
either
overnight
or
returning
to
their
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
have
something
when
they
arrive
cooked
lunch
and
meal
which
one
could
describe
as
high
tea
before
they
leave
sister
holland
will
also
be
in
as
of
course
will
mr
chandler
powell
and
the
patients
mr
chandler
powell
sometimes
leaves
the
manor
as
early
as
five
thirty
to
see
his
london
patients
he
usually
back
by
one
and
good
which
he
likes
served
in
his
own
sitting
room
because
of
his
need
sometimes
to
return
for
part
of
day
to
london
his
meals
can
be
erratic
but
they
are
always
important
shall
discuss
the
with
you
in
advance
sister
is
responsible
for
all
the
patients
needs
so
ll
ask
her
now
to
describe
what
she
sister
holland
said
the
patients
are
required
to
fast
before
an
anaesthetic
and
usually
eat
little
until
the
first
day
after
the
operation
on
its
and
what
has
been
done
when
they
are
well
enough
to
eat
they
to
be
demanding
and
some
will
be
on
and
the
or
will
this
patients
usually
eat
in
their
rooms
and
nothing
should
be
served
to
them
without
my
approval
she
turned
to
kimberley
usually
one
of
my
nursing
staff
will
take
the
food
up
to
the
patients
wing
but
you
may
be
required
to
serve
tea
or
occasional
drinks
you
do
understand
that
even
these
approval
yes
sister
understand
apart
from
the
patients
food
you
will
take
your
instructions
from
miss
cressett
or
if
she
isn
here
from
her
deputy
mrs
frensham
and
now
mrs
frensham
has
some
questions
for
you
mrs
frensham
was
tall
elderly
and
lady
with
steel
grey
hair
curled
into
but
her
eyes
were
kind
and
dean
felt
more
at
home
with
her
than
with
the
much
younger
dark
haired
and
he
thought
rather
sister
holland
or
miss
cressett
with
her
extraordinary
pale
and
distinctive
face
he
supposed
some
people
might
find
her
attractive
but
no
one
could
say
she
was
pretty
mrs
frensham
questions
were
directed
at
kim
and
were
not
difficult
what
biscuits
would
she
serve
with
coffee
in
the
morning
and
how
would
she
make
them
kim
immediately
at
ease
described
her
own
for
thin
biscuits
with
and
how
would
she
make
again
kim
had
no
difficulty
dean
was
asked
which
of
three
named
he
would
serve
with
and
of
and
what
meals
he
would
suggest
for
very
hot
summer
day
or
in
the
difficult
days
after
christmas
he
gave
which
were
obviously
regarded
as
it
had
not
been
difficult
test
and
he
could
sense
kim
it
was
mrs
frensham
who
took
them
to
the
kitchen
and
afterwards
turned
to
kim
and
said
do
you
think
you
could
be
happy
here
mrs
bostock
dean
decided
then
that
he
liked
mrs
frensham
and
kim
was
happy
for
her
getting
this
job
had
been
he
remembered
that
mixture
of
and
delight
with
which
she
had
moved
about
the
large
kitchen
then
as
if
in
dream
through
the
rooms
beyond
it
the
sitting
room
the
bedroom
and
the
bathroom
which
would
be
theirs
touching
the
furniture
in
wonder
running
to
look
out
of
every
window
finally
they
had
gone
into
the
garden
and
she
had
flung
out
her
arms
to
the
view
then
taken
his
hand
like
child
and
gazed
at
him
with
shining
eyes
it
wonderful
can
believe
it
no
rent
to
pay
and
we
get
our
keep
we
ll
be
able
to
save
both
our
wages
for
her
it
had
been
new
beginning
filled
with
hope
bright
with
pictures
of
them
working
together
becoming
the
on
the
lawn
their
child
running
about
the
garden
watched
from
the
kitchen
windows
for
him
looking
into
her
eyes
he
knew
that
it
had
been
the
