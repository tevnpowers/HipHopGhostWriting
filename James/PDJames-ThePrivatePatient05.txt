it
was
the
light
flickering
in
the
stones
that
had
frightened
me
and
was
keeping
me
awake
that
why
wanted
the
tea
and
wanted
company
but
kimberley
didn
stay
long
suppose
she
not
allowed
to
to
the
patients
chandler
powell
suddenly
you
didn
think
of
waking
sister
holland
you
knew
her
room
was
on
the
corridor
next
to
yours
that
why
she
on
the
patients
floor
to
be
available
if
patient
needs
her
she
probably
have
thought
was
being
and
didn
think
was
patient
not
until
the
operation
it
wasn
as
if
needed
anything
or
sleeping
there
was
silence
as
if
for
the
first
time
the
importance
of
what
she
had
been
saying
mrs
skeffington
looked
from
dalgliesh
to
kate
of
course
could
have
been
mistaken
about
the
light
mean
it
was
late
at
night
and
could
have
been
imagining
things
kate
said
when
you
went
into
the
corridor
with
the
idea
of
visiting
the
patient
next
door
were
you
certain
then
that
you
seen
light
well
must
have
been
mustn
mean
otherwise
wouldn
have
gone
out
like
that
but
that
doesn
mean
it
really
had
been
there
hadn
been
awake
for
long
and
suppose
looking
out
on
the
stones
and
thinking
of
the
poor
woman
burnt
alive
could
have
imagined
was
seeing
ghost
kate
said
and
earlier
when
you
heard
the
lift
door
and
the
lift
descending
are
you
now
saying
that
too
could
have
been
imagination
well
don
suppose
could
have
imagined
hearing
the
lift
mean
someone
must
have
been
using
it
but
they
easily
could
couldn
they
mean
anyone
wanting
to
come
up
to
the
patients
corridor
someone
visiting
rhoda
gradwyn
for
example
the
silence
which
fell
seemed
to
kate
to
last
for
minutes
then
dalgliesh
said
did
you
at
any
time
last
night
see
or
hear
anything
next
door
or
anything
in
the
corridor
outside
your
room
no
nothing
nothing
only
knew
that
there
was
anyone
next
door
because
heard
sister
going
in
mean
everyone
is
kept
very
confidential
at
the
clinic
chandler
powell
said
surely
miss
cressett
told
you
when
she
took
you
up
to
your
room
she
did
mention
that
there
was
only
one
other
patient
in
but
she
didn
tell
me
where
she
was
or
her
name
anyway
don
see
that
it
matters
and
could
have
been
mistaken
about
the
light
only
wasn
about
the
lift
don
think
could
have
been
mistaken
about
hearing
the
lift
going
down
perhaps
that
was
what
woke
me
up
she
turned
to
dalgliesh
and
now
want
to
go
home
my
husband
said
wouldn
be
bothered
that
the
best
team
in
the
met
would
be
put
on
the
job
and
be
protected
don
want
to
stay
in
place
where
there
murderer
on
the
loose
and
it
could
have
been
me
perhaps
it
was
me
he
wanted
to
kill
after
all
my
husband
has
enemies
powerful
men
always
have
and
was
next
door
alone
suppose
he
gone
to
the
wrong
room
and
killed
me
by
mistake
patients
come
here
because
they
believe
it
safe
god
knows
it
expensive
enough
and
how
did
he
get
in
ve
told
you
everything
know
but
don
think
could
swear
to
it
in
court
don
see
why
should
have
to
dalgliesh
said
it
may
be
necessary
mrs
skeffington
shall
almost
certainly
want
to
speak
to
you
again
and
if
so
can
of
course
see
you
in
london
either
at
your
house
or
at
new
yard
the
prospect
was
clearly
unwelcome
but
glancing
from
kate
to
dalgliesh
mrs
skeffington
obviously
decided
it
was
not
to
comment
instead
she
smiled
at
dalgliesh
and
assumed
the
voice
of
child
and
please
may
go
now
ve
tried
to
be
helpful
really
have
but
it
was
late
and
was
alone
and
frightened
and
now
it
all
seems
like
terrible
dream
but
dalgliesh
hadn
yet
finished
with
his
witness
he
asked
were
you
given
keys
to
the
west
door
when
you
arrived
mrs
skeffington
yes
was
by
sister
always
given
two
security
keys
this
time
it
was
set
number
one
gave
them
to
mrs
frensham
when
she
helped
me
with
my
came
up
to
carry
the
bags
to
the
car
he
wasn
allowed
to
use
the
lift
so
he
had
to
them
down
the
stairs
mr
chandler
powell
ought
to
mog
isn
really
suitable
to
be
in
the
manor
in
any
where
did
you
put
the
keys
during
the
night
by
my
bed
suppose
no
it
was
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
television
anyway
gave
them
to
mrs
frensham
if
they
re
lost
that
nothing
to
do
with
me
dalgliesh
said
no
they
re
not
lost
thank
you
for
your
help
mrs
skeffington
now
that
she
was
at
last
free
to
leave
mrs
skeffington
became
and
vague
thanks
and
smiles
on
everyone
present
chandler
powell
her
out
to
the
car
no
doubt
kate
thought
he
would
take
the
opportunity
to
or
her
but
even
he
could
hardly
hope
that
she
would
hold
her
tongue
she
wouldn
return
of
course
and
nor
would
others
patients
might
enjoy
small
of
terror
at
the
thought
of
century
burning
but
were
unlikely
to
choose
clinic
where
relatively
post
patient
had
been
done
to
death
if
george
chandler
powell
on
his
income
from
the
clinic
to
keep
the
manor
going
he
was
likely
to
be
in
trouble
there
would
be
more
than
one
victim
of
this
murder
they
waited
until
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
rolls
and
chandler
powell
reappeared
dalgliesh
said
the
incident
room
will
be
in
the
old
police
cottage
and
my
officers
will
be
staying
at
wisteria
house
would
be
grateful
if
the
household
could
be
in
the
library
in
half
an
hour
time
meanwhile
the
scene
of
crime
officers
will
be
busy
in
the
west
wing
grateful
to
you
for
putting
the
library
at
my
for
the
next
hour
or
so
by
the
time
dalgliesh
with
kate
had
returned
to
the
scene
of
crime
rhoda
gradwyn
body
had
been
removed
the
two
mortuary
had
with
ease
her
into
body
bag
and
wheeled
the
into
the
lift
benton
was
below
to
see
the
departure
of
the
ambulance
which
had
arrived
instead
of
mortuary
van
to
collect
the
corpse
and
to
the
arrival
of
the
scene
of
crime
officers
the
photographer
large
man
of
few
words
had
completed
his
work
and
had
already
left
and
now
before
beginning
the
routine
of
the
suspects
dalgliesh
returned
with
kate
to
the
empty
bedroom
when
the
young
dalgliesh
had
first
been
to
the
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
air
of
murder
room
always
changed
when
the
corpse
had
been
removed
and
more
subtly
than
the
physical
absence
of
the
victim
the
air
seemed
easier
to
breathe
voices
were
louder
there
was
shared
relief
as
if
an
object
with
some
mysterious
power
to
or
had
been
of
its
some
of
this
feeling
remained
the
bed
with
the
of
the
head
still
on
the
pillow
looked
as
and
normal
as
if
the
had
recently
got
up
from
sleep
and
would
shortly
return
it
was
the
dropped
tray
of
just
inside
the
door
that
for
dalgliesh
imposed
on
the
room
both
dramatic
and
the
scene
looked
as
if
it
had
been
set
up
to
be
for
the
jacket
of
an
none
of
miss
gradwyn
had
been
touched
and
her
briefcase
was
next
door
still
propped
against
the
in
the
sitting
room
large
suitcase
on
stood
beside
the
chest
of
drawers
dalgliesh
placed
his
murder
bag
description
which
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
now
fitted
case
on
the
folding
he
opened
it
and
he
and
kate
put
on
their
search
gloves
miss
gradwyn
handbag
made
of
green
leather
with
silver
and
shaped
like
bag
was
obviously

set
of
keys
small

book
pocket
and
with
set
of
credit
cards
to
containing
four
pounds
in
and
sixty
pounds
in
twenty
and
ten
notes
there
was
also
her
in
leather
cover
small
bottle
of
and
silver
pen
in
the
pocket
designed
for
it
they
found
her
mobile
phone
kate
said
normally
you
would
expect
this
to
be
on
the
bedside
table
it
looks
as
if
she
didn
want
any
calls
the
mobile
was
small
and
new
model
it
open
and
it
on
dalgliesh
checked
the
calls
and
messages
the
old
text
messages
had
been
but
there
was
one
new
one
which
was
as
received
from
robin
and
read
something
very
important
has
cropped
up
need
to
consult
you
please
see
me
please
don
shut
me
out
dalgliesh
said
we
ll
need
to
identify
the
to
see
if
this
involved
his
coming
to
the
manor
but
that
can
wait
just
want
to
take
quick
look
at
the
other
patients
rooms
before
we
start
the
questioning
dr
glenister
said
that
the
killer
was
wearing
gloves
he
or
she
would
want
to
get
rid
of
them
as
quickly
as
possible
if
they
were
surgical
gloves
they
could
have
been
cut
up
and
of
down
one
of
the
anyway
it
worth
look
this
to
wait
for
the
they
were
lucky
in
the
bathroom
of
the
suite
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
they
found
minute
of
fragile
as
piece
of
human
skin
caught
under
the
of
the
lavatory
bowl
dalgliesh
carefully
detached
it
with
and
placed
it
in
an
evidence
bag
closed
it
and
he
and
kate
their
initials
over
the
seal
dalgliesh
said
we
ll
let
the
know
about
this
find
when
they
arrive
this
is
the
suite
they
need
to
concentrate
on
particularly
the
walk
in
cupboard
in
the
bedroom
the
only
bedroom
which
has
one
one
more
to
this
being
an
inside
job
and
now
better
telephone
miss
gradwyn
mother
kate
said
chief
inspector
told
me
that
he
arranged
for
to
visit
her
he
did
that
soon
after
he
arrived
here
it
won
be
news
to
her
do
you
want
me
to
speak
to
her
sir
no
thank
you
kate
she
has
right
to
hear
from
me
but
if
she
already
been
told
there
no
hurry
we
ll
get
on
with
the
group
interviews
ll
see
you
and
benton
in
the
library
the
household
was
and
waiting
with
kate
and
benton
when
dalgliesh
entered
the
library
with
george
chandler
powell
benton
was
interested
in
how
the
group
had
arranged
itself
marcus
westhall
had
himself
from
his
sister
who
was
seated
in
an
upright
chair
by
the
window
and
had
taken
chair
next
to
sister
flavia
holland
perhaps
in
medical
helena
cressett
had
seated
herself
in
one
of
the
armchairs
beside
the
fire
but
perhaps
that
an
appearance
of
complete
would
be
inappropriate
sat
upright
hands
on
the
chair
arms
mogworthy
an
had
changed
into
shiny
blue
suit
and
tie
which
gave
him
the
look
of
an
ancient
and
stood
beside
her
back
to
the
fire
the
only
one
on
his
feet
he
turned
to
glare
at
dalgliesh
as
they
entered
the
glare
seemed
to
benton
more
than
aggressive
dean
and
kimberley
bostock
seated
side
by
on
the
only
sofa
made
slight
movement
as
if
uncertain
whether
they
should
rise
then
their
eyes
quickly
round
subsided
into
the
and
kimberley
slid
her
hand
into
her
husband
sharon
bateman
also
sat
alone
bolt
upright
few
feet
from
candace
westhall
her
hands
were
folded
in
her
lap
her
thin
legs
placed
side
by
side
and
the
eyes
which
stared
briefly
into
his
showed
more
than
fear
she
was
wearing
cotton
dress
with
blue
pattern
under
jacket
the
dress
more
appropriate
to
summer
than
to
december
afternoon
was
too
large
for
her
and
benton
wondered
if
this
hint
of
victorian
charity
child
and
over
had
been
mrs
frensham
had
taken
chair
beside
the
window
and
from
time
to
time
glanced
out
as
if
to
remind
herself
that
there
was
world
fresh
and
normal
outside
this
air
made
sour
by
fear
and
tension
all
were
pale
and
despite
the
warmth
of
the
central
and
the
blaze
and
of
the
fire
looked
with
cold
benton
was
interested
to
see
that
the
rest
of
the
company
had
taken
time
to
dress
for
an
occasion
on
which
it
would
be
more
to
show
respect
and
grief
rather
than
apprehension
shirts
were
pressed
and
had
taken
the
place
of
country
or
and
looked
as
if
they
had
been
recently
helena
cressett
was
elegant
in
fitting
trousers
in
fine
black
and
white
check
with
black
her
face
was
drained
of
colour
so
that
even
the
soft
lipstick
she
was
wearing
seemed
an
mark
of
defiance
trying
not
to
his
eyes
on
her
benton
thought
that
face
is
and
was
surprised
to
discover
that
he
found
her
beautiful
the
three
chairs
at
the
mahogany
eighteenth
century
desk
were
empty
and
were
obviously
placed
there
for
the
police
they
seated
themselves
and
chandler
powell
took
his
opposite
close
to
miss
cressett
all
their
eyes
turned
to
him
although
benton
was
aware
that
their
thoughts
were
with
the
tall
dark
haired
man
on
his
right
it
was
he
who
dominated
the
room
but
they
were
there
with
the
consent
of
chandler
powell
this
was
his
house
his
library
and
subtly
he
made
this
plain
he
said
his
voice
calm
and
authoritative
commander
dalgliesh
has
asked
for
the
use
of
this
room
so
that
he
and
his
officers
can
see
and
question
us
together
think
you
ve
all
met
mr
dalgliesh
detective
inspector
miskin
and
detective
sergeant
benton
smith
not
here
to
make
speech
just
want
to
say
that
what
happened
here
last
night
has
appalled
all
of
us
it
is
now
our
duty
to
co
operate
fully
with
the
police
in
their
investigation
obviously
we
can
hope
that
this
tragedy
will
remain
unknown
outside
the
manor
answering
the
press
and
other
media
enquiries
will
be
by
and
asking
you
all
now
not
to
speak
to
anyone
outside
these
walls
at
least
for
the
present
commander
dalgliesh
would
you
like
to
take
over
benton
got
out
his
notebook
he
had
early
in
his
career
devised
distinctive
if
of
which
although
it
owed
something
to
mr
system
was
highly
personal
his
chief
had
almost
perfect
recall
but
it
was
his
job
to
watch
listen
and
record
everything
said
or
seen
he
knew
why
ad
had
decided
on
this
preliminary
group
it
was
important
to
get
an
view
of
exactly
what
had
taken
place
since
rhoda
gradwyn
had
entered
the
manor
on
the
afternoon
of
december
and
this
could
be
achieved
more
if
everyone
concerned
was
present
to
add
comments
or
make
most
suspects
were
capable
of
lying
with
some
conviction
when
questioned
alone
some
indeed
were
at
it
benton
recalled
number
of
occasions
when
apparently
heart
broken
lovers
and
for
help
in
murder
even
when
they
knew
where
they
had
hidden
the
body
but
to
lie
in
company
was
more
difficult
suspect
might
be
at
his
own
expression
but
the
of
his
could
be
dalgliesh
said
the
idea
of
calling
you
together
is
to
get
group
picture
of
exactly
what
happened
to
rhoda
gradwyn
from
the
moment
she
arrived
here
until
the
discovery
of
her
body
shall
of
course
need
to
speak
to
you
but
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
make
some
progress
in
the
next
half
hour
or
so
there
was
silence
broken
by
helena
cressett
who
said
the
first
person
to
see
miss
gradwyn
was
mogworthy
who
opened
the
gate
for
her
the
reception
party
of
sister
holland
mr
westhall
and
myself
was
waiting
in
the
great
hall
her
voice
was
calm
the
words
direct
and
matter
of
fact
for
benton
the
message
was
clear
if
we
have
to
go
through
this
public
for
god
sake
let
get
on
with
it
mogworthy
stared
at
dalgliesh
that
right
she
was
on
time
more
or
less
miss
helena
said
to
expect
her
after
tea
and
before
dinner
and
had
my
eyes
open
for
her
from
four
clock
at
six
forty
five
she
arrived
opened
the
gate
for
her
and
she
parked
the
car
herself
and
she
said
she
cope
with
her
own
only
one
case
and
that
on
very
determined
lady
waited
till
she
gone
round
to
the

no
more
for
me
to
do

home
dalgliesh

it
from
the
car
park
she
could
get

up
to
the
patients
floor
if
not
someone
would
do
it
for
her
the
last
saw
of
her
was
going
through
the
front
door
did
you
enter
the
manor
at
any
time
after
you
saw
miss
gradwyn
arrive
why
would
do
that
dalgliesh
said
don
know
asking
if
you

not
and
since
we
re
talking
about
me
like
to
say
things

to
ask
so
ll
save
you
the
trouble

where
she
was
sleeping
on
the
patients
floor
where
else
and
ve
got
keys
to
the
garden
door
but
never
set
eyes
on
her
dead
or
alive
after
she
went
through
the
front
door

kill
her
and

world

as
well
to

dalgliesh
said
thank
you
mr
mogworthy
you
have
spoken
and
it
has
been
helpful
is
there
anything
else
you
can
think
of
that
we
ought
to
know
anything
you
saw
or
heard
after
you
left
for
example
did
you
see
anyone
near
the
manor
stranger
perhaps
someone
acting
mog
said
any
stranger
round
the
manor
after
dark
is
suspicious
to
me
never
seen
nobody
last
night
but
there
were
car
parked
in
the
lay
by
by
the
stones
not
when
left
later
mog
quickly
of
sly
satisfaction
benton
suspected
that
the
of
the
disclosure
was
less
than
it
sounded
the
reception
of
his
news
was
certainly
no
one
spoke
but
in
the
silence
benton
detected
soft
like
the
of
breath
this
was
news
to
them
all
as
no
doubt
mogworthy
had
intended
benton
watched
their
faces
as
they
glanced
at
each
other
it
was
moment
of
shared
relief
quickly
concealed
but
unmistakable
dalgliesh
asked
can
you
remember
anything
about
the
car
the
make
colour
car
could
be
black
or
blue
the
lights
were
out
someone
sitting
in
the
driver
seat
but
don
know
whether
anyone
else
was
there
you
didn
note
the
number
no
didn
why
would
be
noticing
car
numbers
were
just
passing
cycling
home
from
mrs
cottage
where
been
having
my
friday
fish
and
chips
same
as
always
do
when
on
the
bike
keep
my
eyes
on
the
road
not
like
some
all
know
is
there
were
car
there
at
what
time
before
midnight
maybe
five
or
ten
minutes
before
always
reckon
to
get
home
by
midnight
chandler
powell
said
this
is
important
evidence
mog
why
didn
you
speak
earlier
for
why
you
said
yourself
that
we
weren
to
gossip
about
miss
gradwyn
death
but
wait
until
the
police
arrived
well
the
boss
man
is
here
now
so
telling
him
what
saw
before
anyone
could
respond
the
door
was
flung
open
all
eyes
turned
towards
it
man
burst
in
with
dc
warren
just
behind
him
his
appearance
was
as
extraordinary
as
his
was
dramatic
benton
saw
pale
handsome
somewhat
face
blazing
blue
eyes
and
fair
hair
to
his
forehead
like
the
locks
of
god
he
was
wearing
long
black
coat
almost
to
the
floor
over
pale
blue
jeans
and
for
moment
benton
thought
he
was
in
his
pyjamas
and
dressing
gown
if
his
entrance
had
been
planned
he
could
hardly
have
chosen
more
propitious
moment
but
seemed
unlikely
the
newcomer
was
shaking
with
poorly
controlled
emotions
grief
perhaps
but
also
fear
and
anger
he
stared
from
face
to
face
confused
and
before
he
could
speak
candace
westhall
spoke
calmly
from
her
seat
by
the
window
our
cousin
robin
boyton
he
staying
in
the
guest
cottage
robin
this
is
commander
dalgliesh
of
new
yard
and
his
colleagues
inspector
miskin
and
sergeant
benton
smith
robin
ignored
her
and
turned
his
blaze
of
anger
on
marcus
you
bastard
you
cold
black
hearted
bastard
my
friend
dear
close
friend
is
dead
murdered
and
you
didn
even
have
the
to
tell
me
and
here
you
all
are
up
to
the
police
deciding
together
to
keep
all
this
quiet
we
mustn
upset
mr
chandler
powell
valuable
work
must
we
and
she
lying
upstairs
dead
you
should
have
told
me
somebody
should
have
told
me
need
to
see
her
want
to
say
goodbye
and
now
he
was
openly
his
tears
falling
dalgliesh
didn
speak
but
benton
glancing
at
him
saw
that
the
dark
eyes
were
watchful
candace
westhall
half
rose
as
if
about
to
comfort
her
cousin
then
subsided
it
was
her
brother
who
spoke
afraid
that
isn
possible
robin
miss
gradwyn
body
has
been
taken
to
the
mortuary
but
did
attempt
to
tell
you
called
at
the
cottage
shortly
before
nine
but
you
were
obviously
still
asleep
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
the
front
door
locked
think
you
did
tell
us
at
some
time
that
you
knew
rhoda
gradwyn
but
not
that
you
were
close
friend
dalgliesh
spoke
mr
boyton
at
present
only
those
people
who
were
in
this
house
from
the
time
miss
gradwyn
arrived
on
thursday
until
the
discovery
of
her
death
at
seven
thirty
this
morning
if
you
were
among
them
then
please
stay
if
not
or
one
of
my
officers
will
see
you
as
soon
as
possible
boyton
had
controlled
his
rage
through
the
of
breath
his
voice
took
on
the
tone
of
child
of
course
not
among
them
haven
been
inside
until
now
the
policeman
at
the
door
wouldn
let
me
in
dalgliesh
said
that
was
on
my
orders
chandler
powell
said
and
earlier
on
mine
miss
gradwyn
asked
for
absolute
privacy
sorry
you
ve
been
caused
this
distress
mr
boyton
but
afraid
was
so
busy
here
with
the
police
officers
and
the
pathologist
that
overlooked
the
fact
that
you
were
guest
in
the
cottage
have
you
had
lunch
dean
and
kimberley
can
get
you
something
to
eat
of
course
haven
had
lunch
when
have
you
ever
fed
me
when
ve
been
in
rose
cottage
and
don
want
your
bloody
food
don
me
he
drew
himself
up
and
stretching
out
shaking
arm
pointed
his
finger
at
chandler
powell
then
perhaps
that
dressed
as
he
was
the
made
him
look
ridiculous
he
dropped
his
arm
and
gazed
round
the
company
in
misery
dalgliesh
said
mr
boyton
as
you
were
friend
of
miss
gradwyn
what
you
have
to
tell
us
will
be
helpful
but
not
now
the
words
quietly
spoken
were
command
boyton
turned
away
his
shoulders
drooping
then
he
swung
back
and
spoke
directly
to
chandler
powell
she
came
here
to
have
that
scar
removed
to
make
new
life
for
herself
she
trusted
you
and
you
killed
her
you
bastard
without
waiting
for
response
he
was
gone
dc
warren
who
had
stood
throughout
followed
him
out
and
closed
the
door
firmly
there
were
five
seconds
of
silence
during
which
benton
sensed
that
the
mood
had
changed
someone
at
last
had
spoken
that
word
the
the
grotesque
the
had
at
last
been
acknowledged
dalgliesh
said
shall
we
get
on
miss
cressett
you
received
miss
gradwyn
at
the
door
can
we
take
it
from
there
for
the
next
twenty
minutes
the
proceeded
smoothly
and
benton
concentrated
on
his
helena
cressett
had
welcomed
the
new
patient
to
the
manor
and
had
taken
her
directly
to
her
room
as
she
was
to
have
an
anaesthetic
next
morning
no
dinner
was
served
and
miss
gradwyn
had
said
she
would
like
to
be
alone
the
patient
had
insisted
on
her
own
case
to
the
bedroom
and
was
her
books
when
miss
cressett
left
on
friday
she
knew
of
course
that
miss
gradwyn
had
had
her
operation
and
been
in
the
early
evening
from
the
recovery
room
to
her
suite
in
the
patients

was
the
usual

was
not
concerned
with
patient

nor
did
she
visit
miss

in
her

she
had
dinner
in

was
hoping

been
in

by
midnight
and
had
heard
nothing
during
the
night

showered
and
dressed
when
mr
chandler
powell
arrived
to
tell
her
that
rhoda
gradwyn
was
dead
miss
cressett
evidence
was
quietly
confirmed
by
mrs
frensham
who
said
that
she
had
left
miss
cressett
in
her
sitting
room
and
had
herself
gone
to
her
own
apartment
in
the
east
wing
at
about
eleven
thirty
and
had
seen
and
heard
nothing
during
the
night
she
knew
nothing
about

death
until
she
came
down
to
the
dining
room
at
quarter
to
eight
and
found
no
one
there
later
mr
chandler
powell
had
arrived
and
had
told
her
that
miss
gradwyn
was
dead
candace
westhall
confirmed
that
she
had
worked
with

in
the

she
had
returned
to
tidy
away
papers
in
the
office
and
left
the
manor
shortly
after
ten
by
the
front
door
mr
chandler
powell
was
coming
down
the
stairs
and
they
said
goodnight
before
she
left
next
morning
he
rang
from
the
office
to
say
miss
gradwyn
had
been
found
dead
and
she
and
her
brother
came
over
to
the
manor
immediately
marcus
westhall
had
returned
from
london
in
the
early
hours
she
had
heard
his
car
arrive
but
had
not
got
up
though
he
had
knocked
on
her
bedroom
door
and
they
had
spoken
briefly
sister
flavia
holland
gave
her
evidence
and
calmly
early
in
the
morning
of
the
operation
the
anaesthetist
and
additional
medical
and
staff
had
arrived
nurse
frazer
one
of
the
temporary
staff
had
brought
the
patient
down
to
the
operating
suite
where
she
had
been
examined
by
the
anaesthetist
who
had
previously
examined
her
at
st
angela
in
london
mr
chandler
powell
had
spent
some
time
with
her
to
and
her
he
would
have
described
exactly
what
he
proposed
to
do
when
miss
gradwyn
had
met
him
in
his
office
in
st
angela
miss
gradwyn
had
been
very
calm
throughout
and
had
shown
no
sign
of
fear
or
indeed
of
particular
anxiety
the
anaesthetist
and
all
the
staff
had
left
as
soon
as
the
operation
was
completed
they
would
have
been
returning
the
following
morning
for
mrs
skeffington
operation
she
had
arrived
yesterday
afternoon
after
the
operation
miss
gradwyn
had
been
in
the
recovery
room
under
the
care
of
mr
chandler
powell
and
herself
and
at
four
thirty
had
been
wheeled
back
to
her
room
by
then
the
patient
was
able
to
walk
and
said
she
felt
little
pain
she
then
slept
until
seven
thirty
when
she
had
been
able
to
eat
light
supper
she
refused
sedative
but
asked
for
glass
of
hot
milk
and
brandy
sister
holland
was
in
the
end
room
on
the
left
and
looked
in
to
check
on
miss
gradwyn
every
hour
until
she
herself
went
to
bed
which
was
perhaps
as
late
as
midnight
the
eleven
clock
check
was
the
last
and
the
patient
was
asleep
she
heard
nothing
during
the
night
mr
chandler
powell
account
agreed
with
hers
he
that
at
no
time
had
the
patient
shown
fear
either
of
the
operation
or
of
anything
else
she
had
specifically
asked
that
no
visitors
be
allowed
during
her
period
of
week
convalescence
and
that
was
why
robin
boyton
had
been
refused
the
operation
had
gone
well
but
had
been
longer
and
more
difficult
than
he
had
expected
he
had
however
felt
confident
of
an
excellent
result
miss
gradwyn
was
healthy
woman
who
had
stood
the
and
operation
well
and
he
had
no
about
her
progress
he
had
visited
her
on
the
night
she
died
at
about
ten
clock
and
had
been
returning
from
that
visit
when
he
saw
miss
westhall
leaving
sharon
had
been
sitting
very
still
with
look
which
kate
thought
could
only
be
described
as
throughout
the
proceedings
but
when
asked
where
she
had
been
and
what
she
had
done
the
previous
day
had
at
first
on
tedious
expressed
review
of
every
detail
of
the
morning
and
afternoon
asked
to
herself
to
the
time
from
four
thirty
onwards
she
said
that
she
had
been
busy
in
the
kitchen
and
dining
room
helping
dean
and
kimberley
bostock
had
had
her
meal
with
them
at
eight
forty
five
and
had
then
gone
to
her
own
room
to
watch
television
she
couldn
remember
when
she
went
to
bed
or
what
she
had
seen
on
television
she
had
been
very
tired
and
had
slept
throughout
the
night
she
knew
nothing
about
miss
gradwyn
being
dead
until
sister
holland
had
come
up
to
her
telling
her
to
come
on
duty
and
help
in
the
kitchen
which
she
thought
had
been
at
about
nine
clock
she
liked
miss
gradwyn
who
had
asked
her
to
show
her
round
the
garden
on
her
previous
visit
asked
by
kate
what
they
had
talked
about
she
said
it
was
about
her
childhood
and
where
she
had
gone
to
school
and
her
work
at
the
old
people
home
there
was
no
surprise
until
dean
and
kimberley
bostock
gave
their
evidence
kimberley
said
she
was
sometimes
asked
by
sister
to
take
food
to
the
patients
but
she
hadn
visited
miss
gradwyn
because
she
was
neither
she
nor
her
husband
had
seen
the
patient
arriving
and
they
had
been
particularly
busy
that
evening
preparing
meals
for
the
extra
operating
theatre
staff
who
would
arrive
next
day
and
always
had
lunch
before
leaving
she
had
been
woken
by
the
telephone
just
before
midnight
on
the
friday
evening
by
mrs
skeffington
who
had
asked
for
tea
her
husband
had
helped
her
carry
up
the
tray
he
never
went
into
the
patients
rooms
but
had
waited
outside
until
she
came
out
mrs
skeffington
had
appeared
frightened
and
talked
about
seeing
light
flickering
among
the
stones
but
kimberley
thought
this
was
just
imagination
she
had
asked
mrs
skeffington
if
she
wanted
her
to
call
sister
holland
but
she
had
said
no
that
sister
holland
would
only
be
annoyed
with
her
for
waking
her
unnecessarily
at
this
stage
sister
holland
had
broken
in
your
instructions
kimberley
are
to
call
me
if
patients
ask
for
anything
in
the
night
why
didn
you
mrs
skeffington
was
pre
and
now
benton
raising
his
head
from
his
notebook
was
alert
he
could
see
that
the
question
was
deeply
unwelcome
the
girl
flushed
she
glanced
at
her
husband
and
their
hands
tightened
she
said
sorry
sister
thought
she
wouldn
really
be
patient
until
the
next
day
so
didn
wake
you
did
ask
her
if
she
wanted
to
see
you
or
mr
chandler
powell
mrs
skeffington
was
patient
from
the
time
she
arrived
at
the
manor
kimberley
you
knew
how
to
contact
me
you
should
have
done
so
dalgliesh
said
did
mrs
skeffington
mention
anything
about
hearing
the
lift
in
the
night
no
she
only
spoke
about
the
lights
and
did
either
of
you
hear
or
see
anything
unusual
while
you
were
on
that
floor
they
looked
at
each
other
then
shook
their
heads
vigorously
dean
said
we
were
only
there
few
minutes
everything
was
quiet
light
was
on
in
the
corridor
as
it
always
is
and
the
lift
did
you
notice
the
lift
yes
sir
the
lift
was
on
the
ground
floor
we
used
it
to
take
up
the
tea
we
could
have
gone
up
the
stairs
but
the
lift
is
quicker
and
is
there
anything
else
you
need
to
tell
me
about
that
night
and
now
there
was
silence
again
the
two
looked
at
each
other
dean
seemed
to
be
he
said
there
one
thing
sir
when
we
got
back
to
the
ground
floor
saw
that
the
door
to
the
garden
wasn
bolted
we
have
to
pass
the
door
to
get
back
to
our
flat
it
heavy
oak
door
on
the
right
sir
leading
to
the
lime
walk
and
the
cheverell
stones
dalgliesh
said
are
you
sure
about
this
yes
sir
quite
sure
did
you
draw
your
wife
attention
to
the
door
no
sir
not
until
we
were
together
in
the
kitchen
next
morning
and
then
mentioned
it
did
either
or
both
of
you
go
back
to
check
no
sir
and
you
noticed
this
on
your
return
not
when
you
were
helping
your
wife
carry
up
the
tea
just
on
our
return
sister
holland
broke
in
don
know
why
you
needed
to
help
with
the
tea
dean
the
tray
was
hardly
heavy
couldn
kimberley
have
managed
on
her
own
she
usually
does
it
not
as
if
there
isn
lift
and
there
always
dim
light
on
in
the
west
wing
dean
said
yes
she
could
but
don
like
her
moving
about
the
house
on
her
own
late
at
night
what
are
you
afraid
of
dean
said
miserably
it
not
that
just
don
like
it
dalgliesh
said
quietly
did
you
know
that
mr
chandler
powell
normally
bolts
that
door
promptly
at
eleven
clock
yes
sir
knew
it
everyone
does
but
sometimes
it
little
later
if
he
takes
walk
in
the
garden
thought
if
bolted
it
he
might
be
out
there
and
not
able
to
get
back
in
sister
holland
said
walking
in
the
garden
after
midnight
in
december
is
that
likely
dean
he
looked
not
at
her
but
at
dalgliesh
and
said
it
wasn
my
job
to
bolt
it
sir
and
it
was
locked
no
one
could
have
got
in
without
key
dalgliesh
turned
to
chandler
powell
and
you
re
confident
that
you
bolted
the
door
at
eleven
bolted
it
as
usual
at
eleven
and
found
it
bolted
at
six
thirty
this
morning
did
anyone
here
it
for
any
purpose
you
can
all
see
the
importance
of
this
we
need
to
get
this
cleared
up
now
no
one
spoke
the
silence
lengthened
dalgliesh
said
did
anyone
else
notice
that
the
door
was
either
bolted
or
after
eleven
again
silence
this
time
finally
broken
by
low
murmur
of
benton
noticed
that
they
avoided
each
other
eyes
dalgliesh
said
then
that
will
be
enough
for
now
thank
you
for
your
co
operation
would
like
to
see
you
all
either
here
or
in
the
incident
room
in
old
police
cottage
dalgliesh
got
to
his
feet
and
the
rest
of
the
room
quietly
and
in
turn
also
rose
still
no
one
spoke
they
were
the
hall
when
chandler
powell
caught
up
with
them
he
said
to
dalgliesh
like
quick
word
now
if
you
can
spare
the
time
dalgliesh
and
kate
followed
him
into
the
office
and
the
door
closed
benton
felt
no
resentment
at
an
which
had
been
subtly
conveyed
but
not
spoken
he
knew
there
were
moments
in
any
investigation
when
two
officers
could
information
and
three
it
chandler
powell
wasted
no
time
while
the
three
of
them
stood
he
said
there
something
ought
to
say
obviously
you
saw
kimberley
when
she
was
asked
why
she
hadn
woken
flavia
holland
think
it
likely
that
she
tried
the
door
to
the
suite
wasn
locked
and
if
she
or
dean
partly
opened
it
they
would
have
heard
voices
mine
and
flavia
was
with
her
at
midnight
think
the
bostocks
may
have
felt
some
in
telling
you
this
particularly
with
the
others
present
kate
said
but
wouldn
you
have
heard
the
door
opening
he
looked
at
her
calmly
not
necessarily
we
were
busy
talking
dalgliesh
said
ll
confirm
that
with
the
bostocks
later
how
long
were
you
together
after
finished
setting
the
and
the
garden
door
joined
flavia
in
her
sitting
room
was
there
until
about
one
clock
there
were
things
we
needed
to
discuss
some
professional
some
personal
neither
has
any
to
rhoda
gradwyn
death
during
that
time
neither
of
us
heard
or
saw
anything
and
you
didn
hear
the
lift
we
didn
hear
it
nor
would
expect
to
as
you
saw
it
by
the
stairs
opposite
sister
sitting
room
but
it
modern
and
comparatively
sister
holland
will
of
course
confirm
my
story
and
ve
no
doubt
that
kimberley
when
questioned
by
someone
experienced
in
information
from
the
vulnerable
will
admit
to
hearing
our
voices
now
she
knows
that
ve
spoken
to
you
and
don
give
me
too
much
credit
for
telling
you
what
hope
will
remain
confidential
have
to
be
particularly
not
to
notice
that
if
rhoda
gradwyn
died
at
about
midnight
flavia
and
have
given
each
other
an
alibi
may
as
well
be
frank
ve
no
wish
to
be
treated
differently
from
the
others
but
doctors
do
not
murder
their
patients
and
if
had
it
in
mind
to
destroy
this
place
and
my
reputation
have
done
it
before
not
after
the
operation
hate
having
my
work
wasted
looking
at
chandler
powell
face
suddenly
with
an
anger
and
disgust
which
transformed
him
dalgliesh
could
believe
that
those
last
words
at
least
were
the
truth
dalgliesh
walked
alone
into
the
garden
to
telephone
rhoda
gradwyn
mother
it
was
call
he
dreaded
to
in
person
as
local
woman
police
officer
had
already
done
was
difficult
enough
it
was
duty
no
police
officer
welcomed
and
he
had
done
his
share
of
it
before
raising
hand
to
knock
or
ring
at
the
door
door
that
was
invariably
immediately
opened
and
meeting
eyes
puzzled
hopeful
or
with
news
that
would
change
life
some
of
his
colleagues
he
knew
would
have
left
this
task
to
kate
to
convey
sympathy
to
parent
by
telephone
struck
him
as
but
he
had
always
felt
that
the
next
of
kin
should
know
who
was
the
investigating
officer
in
charge
of
murder
case
and
should
be
kept
in
touch
with
the
progress
as
far
as
the
operation
made
this
man
voice
answered
it
sounded
both
puzzled
and
as
if
the
phone
were
some
from
which
no
good
news
could
ever
be
expected
without
himself
he
said
with
obvious
relief
the
police
you
said
hold
on
please
ll
fetch
my
wife
dalgliesh
again
identified
himself
and
expressed
his
sympathy
as
gently
as
possible
knowing
that
she
had
already
received
news
which
no
gentleness
could
soften
he
was
met
by
an
silence
and
then
in
voice
as
as
if
he
had
been
an
unwelcome
invitation
to
tea
she
said
it
good
of
you
to
phone
but
we
do
know
the
young
lady
from
the
local
police
has
been
to
break
the
news
she
said
that
someone
from
the
dorset
police
had
phoned
her
she
left
at
ten
clock
she
was
very
kind
we
had
cup
of
tea
together
but
she
didn
tell
me
much
just
that
rhoda
had
been
found
dead
and
that
it
wasn
natural
death
still
can
believe
it
mean
who
would
want
to
harm
rhoda
asked
what
had
happened
and
if
the
police
knew
who
was
responsible
but
she
said
that
she
wasn
able
to
answer
questions
like
that
because
another
force
was
in
charge
and
that
you
be
in
touch
she
only
come
to
break
the
news
still
it
was
kind
of
her
dalgliesh
asked
had
your
daughter
any
enemies
you
were
aware
of
mrs
brown
anyone
who
might
have
wished
her
harm
and
now
he
could
hear
the
clear
note
of
resentment
well
she
must
ve
had
mustn
she
or
she
wouldn
have
been
murdered
she
was
in
private
clinic
rhoda
didn
do
things
on
the
cheap
so
why
didn
they
look
after
her
the
clinic
must
have
been
very
careless
letting
patient
get
murdered
she
had
so
much
to
look
forward
to
rhoda
was
very
successful
she
was
always
clever
just
like
her
dad
did
she
tell
you
that
she
was
having
her
scar
removed
at
the
cheverell
manor
clinic
she
told
me
she
was
planning
to
get
rid
of
the
scar
but
not
where
she
was
going
or
when
she
was
very
private
rhoda
she
was
like
that
as
child
keeping
her
secrets
not
telling
anyone
what
she
thought
we
didn
see
much
of
each
other
after
she
left
home
but
she
did
come
to
my
wedding
down
here
in
may
and
she
told
me
then
about
getting
rid
of
the
scar
of
course
she
should
have
had
something
done
about
it
years
ago
she
had
it
for
over
thirty
years
it
was
caused
by
knocking
her
face
against
the
kitchen
door
when
she
was
thirteen
so
you
can
tell
us
very
much
about
her
friends
her
private
life
ve
told
you
ve
said
she
was
private
don
know
anything
about
her
friends
or
her
private
life
and
don
know
what
going
to
happen
about
the
funeral
whether
it
ought
to
be
in
london
or
here
don
know
whether
there
are
things
that
ought
to
do
there
are
usually
forms
to
fill
in
people
have
to
be
told
don
want
to
bother
my
husband
he
very
upset
about
it
he
liked
rhoda
when
they
met
dalgliesh
said
there
will
have
to
be
post
mortem
of
course
and
then
the
coroner
may
release
the
body
have
you
some
friends
who
could
help
and
you
well
ve
got
friends
at
the
church
ll
speak
to
our
vicar
and
perhaps
he
can
help
perhaps
we
could
have
the
service
down
here
only
of
course
she
was
quite
well
known
in
london
and
she
wasn
religious
so
perhaps
she
wouldn
want
service
hope
not
expected
to
go
to
this
clinic
wherever
it
is
it
in
dorset
mrs
brown
in
stoke
cheverell
well
can
leave
mr
brown
to
come
to
dorset
there
really
no
need
unless
later
you
particularly
wish
to
attend
the
inquest
why
not
have
word
with
your
solicitor
expect
that
your
daughter
solicitor
will
be
getting
in
touch
with
you
we
found
the
name
and
address
in
her
handbag
sure
he
ll
be
helpful
afraid
shall
need
to
examine
her
both
here
and
in
her
london
home
may
have
to
take
some
away
for
examination
but
they
will
all
be
carefully
looked
after
and
later
returned
to
you
have
your
permission
for
that
you
can
take
what
you
like
ve
never
been
to
her
london
house
suppose
ll
have
to
sooner
or
later
there
may
be
something
valuable
there
and
there
ll
be
books
she
always
had
plenty
of
books
all
that
reading
she
always
had
her
head
in
book
what
good
will
they
do
they
won
bring
her
back
has
she
had
the
operation
yes
yesterday
and
gather
it
was
successful
so
all
that
money
wasted
for
nothing
poor
rhoda
she
hasn
had
much
luck
for
all
her
success
and
now
her
voice
changed
and
dalgliesh
thought
she
might
be
trying
to
hold
back
tears
she
said
ll
ring
off
now
thank
you
for
don
think
can
take
in
any
more
now
it
shock
rhoda
murdered
it
the
kind
of
thing
you
read
about
or
see
on
television
you
don
expect
it
to
happen
to
someone
you
know
and
she
had
so
much
to
look
forward
to
with
that
scar
gone
it
doesn
seem
fair
dalgliesh
thought
someone
you
know
not
someone
you
love
he
could
hear
now
that
she
was
crying
and
the
line
went
dead
he
paused
for
moment
gazing
at
the
receiver
before
making
the
next
call
to
miss
gradwyn
solicitor
grief
that
emotion
had
no
response
was
in
different
ways
some
of
them
bizarre
he
remembered
his
mother
death
how
at
the
time
wanting
to
behave
well
in
the
face
of
his
father
sorrow
he
had
managed
to
control
his
tears
even
at
the
funeral
but
grief
him
down
the
years
briefly
remembered
snatches
of
conversation
look
her
apparently
gloves
and
more
vivid
than
all
the
small
lasting
which
still
visited
him
himself
leaning
out
of
the
window
of
the
slowly
moving
train
which
was
taking
him
back
to
school
and
seeing
her
figure
in
the
same
coat
she
had
worn
year
after
year
carefully
not
turning
back
to
wave
because
he
had
asked
her
not
to
he
shook
himself
into
the
present
and
picked
up
the
receiver
to
the
call
had
been
answered
by
message
to
say
that
the
office
was
now
closed
until
monday
at
ten
clock
but
that
urgent
matters
would
be
dealt
with
by
the
duty
solicitor
who
could
be
reached
at
given
number
this
number
was
answered
promptly
in
impersonal
voice
and
once
dalgliesh
had
identified
himself
and
explained
that
he
wished
urgently
to
speak
to
mr
his
private
number
was
given
dalgliesh
had
given
no
explanation
but
his
voice
must
have
carried
conviction
not
surprisingly
on
saturday
was
out
of
london
with
his
family
at
his
country
house
in
their
conversation
was
business
like
by
children
voices
and
the
of
after
of
shock
and
personal
regret
which
sounded
more
formal
than
said
naturally
ll
do
all
can
to
assist
the
investigation
you
say
you
ll
be
at
sanctuary
court
tomorrow
morning
you
ve
got
key
yes
of
course
she
would
have
had
it
with
her
ve
none
of
her
private
keys
in
the
office
could
come
up
and
join
you
at
ten
thirty
if
that
time
is
convenient
ll
call
in
at
the
office
and
bring
the
will
with
me
although
you
ll
probably
find
copy
in
the
house
afraid
that
there
little
more
can
do
to
help
as
you
ll
know
commander
relationship
between
solicitor
and
his
client
can
be
close
particularly
if
the
solicitor
has
acted
for
the
family
perhaps
for
some
generations
and
has
come
to
be
regarded
as
and
friend
that
wasn
the
case
here
miss
gradwyn
relationship
with
me
was
one
of
mutual
respect
and
trust
and
certainly
on
my
part
of
liking
but
it
was
purely
professional
knew
the
client
but
not
the
woman
take
it
by
the
way
that
the
next
of
kin
has
been
informed
dalgliesh
said
yes
there
only
her
mother
she
described
her
daughter
as
very
private
person
told
her
should
want
access
to
her
daughter
house
and
she
had
no
to
that
or
my
taking
away
anything
that
might
be
helpful
nor
as
her
solicitor
have
so
ll
see
you
at
her
house
at
about
ten
thirty
extraordinary
business
thank
you
commander
for
getting
in
touch
the
receiver
dalgliesh
reflected
that
murder
unique
crime
for
which
no
is
ever
possible
its
own
as
well
as
its
he
doubted
whether
would
have
interrupted
his
country
weekend
for
less
crime
as
young
officer
he
too
had
been
touched
even
if
and
temporarily
by
the
power
of
murder
to
attract
even
while
it
appalled
and
he
had
watched
how
people
involved
as
innocent
provided
they
were
by
grief
or
suspicion
were
by
drawn
to
the
place
where
the
crime
had
occurred
in
fascinated
the
crowd
and
the
media
who
served
them
had
not
yet
outside
the
wrought
iron
gates
of
the
manor
but
they
would
come
and
he
doubted
whether
chandler
powell
private
security
team
would
be
able
to
do
more
than
inconvenience
them
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
was
occupied
with
the
individual
interviews
most
of
them
taking
place
in
the
library
helena
cressett
was
the
last
of
the
household
to
be
seen
and
dalgliesh
had
given
the
task
to
kate
and
benton
he
sensed
that
miss
cressett
expected
him
to
do
the
questioning
and
he
needed
her
to
know
that
he
headed
team
and
that
both
his
officers
were
competent
surprisingly
she
invited
kate
and
benton
to
join
her
in
her
private
flat
in
the
east
wing
the
room
into
which
she
led
them
was
obviously
her
sitting
room
but
in
its
elegance
and
was
hardly
the
accommodation
housekeeper
administrator
would
expect
to
occupy
the
and
the
placing
of
the
pictures
revealed
highly
individual
taste
and
although
the
room
wasn
exactly
cluttered
there
was
suggestion
of
valued
objects
being
brought
together
more
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
owner
than
as
part
of
plan
it
was
thought
benton
as
if
helena
cressett
had
part
of
the
manor
for
her
private
here
was
none
of
the
dark
solidity
of
tudor
furniture
apart
from
the
sofa
covered
in
cream
linen
and
with
red
which
stood
at
right
angles
to
the
fireplace
most
of
the
furniture
was
nearly
all
the
pictures
on
the
panelled
walls
were
family
portraits
and
miss
cressett
resemblance
to
them
was
unmistakable
none
seemed
to
him
particularly
fine
perhaps
those
had
been
sold
but
all
had
and
were
painted
some
more
than
here
victorian
in
his
lawn
sleeves
gazed
at
the
with
by
suspicion
of
unease
as
if
the
book
on
which
his
rested
was
the
of
species
next
to
him
century
hand
on
posed
with
arrogance
while
over
the
mantelpiece
an
early
victorian
family
was
grouped
in
front
of
the
house
the
mother
with
her
younger
children
gathered
about
her
the
eldest
boy
mounted
on
the
father
at
their
side
and
always
there
were
the
high
brows
above
the
eyes
the
dominant
cheekbones
the
full
curve
of
the
upper
lip
benton
said
you
re
among
your
miss
cressett
the
resemblance
is
neither
dalgliesh
nor
kate
would
have
said
that
it
was
and
could
be
unwise
to
begin
an
interview
with
personal
comment
and
although
kate
was
silent
benton
felt
her
surprise
but
he
quickly
to
himself
remark
which
had
been
by
that
it
would
probably
prove
useful
they
needed
to
know
the
woman
they
were
dealing
with
and
more
precisely
her
status
at
the
manor
how
far
she
was
in
control
and
how
strong
her
influence
on
chandler
powell
and
the
other
her
response
to
what
she
might
see
as
minor
impertinence
could
be
revealing
looking
him
full
in
the
face
she
said
coolly
the
years
that
can
in
curve
and
voice
and
eye
the
human
of
that
is
the
thing
in
man
that
no
call
to
die
it
doesn
take
professional
detective
to
that
do
you
enjoy
thomas
sergeant
as
poet
more
than
agree
find
depressing
his
determination
to
make
his
characters
even
when
little
common
sense
on
both
his
part
and
theirs
could
avoid
it
tess
is
one
of
the
most
irritating
young
women
in
victorian
fiction
won
you
both
sit
down
and
here
was
the
recalling
duty
but
unable
or
unwilling
to
control
the
note
of
reluctance
she
indicated
the
sofa
and
seated
herself
in
an
armchair
facing
it
kate
and
benton
sat
without
kate
took
over
mr
chandler
powell
described
you
as
the
administrator
here
what
exactly
does
the
job
my
job
here
it
difficult
to
describe
manager
administrator
housekeeper
secretary
and
part
time
accountant
suppose
general
manager
covers
it
all
but
mr
chandler
powell
usually
me
as
the
administrator
when
speaking
to
patients
and
you
ve
been
here
how
long
it
will
be
six
years
next
month
kate
said
it
can
have
been
easy
for
you
not
easy
in
what
way
inspector
miss
cressett
tone
was
one
of
detached
interest
but
benton
didn
miss
the
note
of
resentment
he
had
this
reaction
before
suspect
usually
one
with
some
authority
more
used
to
putting
questions
than
answering
them
unwilling
to
the
chief
investigating
officer
but
their
resentment
on
kate
wasn
intimidated
she
said
to
return
to
house
so
beautiful
which
your
family
has
owned
for
generations
and
to
see
someone
else
in
not
everyone
could
cope
with
that
not
everyone
is
required
to
perhaps
should
explain
my
family
owned
and
lived
in
the
manor
for
more
than
four
hundred
years
but
everything
comes
to
an
end
mr
chandler
powell
is
fond
of
the
house
and
it
is
better
in
his
care
than
in
the
care
of
the
others
who
and
wanted
to
buy
it
didn
murder
one
of
his
patients
in
order
to
shut
down
the
clinic
and
pay
him
back
for
my
family
home
or
for
getting
it
cheap
forgive
my
inspector
but
isn
that
what
you
came
to
find
out
it
was
never
wise
to
an
which
hadn
yet
been
made
particularly
with
such
brutal
and
it
was
obvious
that
she
realised
her
mistake
as
soon
as
the
words
were
out
of
her
mouth
so
the
resentment
was
there
but
against
whom
or
what
benton
wondered
the
police
chandler
powell
of
the
west
wing
or
rhoda
gradwyn
who
so
inconveniently
and
had
brought
the
of
investigation
into
her
kate
asked
how
did
you
come
to
get
the
job
applied
for
it
isn
that
usually
how
one
gets
job
it
was
and
thought
it
would
be
interesting
to
return
to
the
manor
and
see
what
changes
had
been
made
apart
from
the
building
of
the
clinic
my
own
profession
if
you
can
call
it
that
is
of
an
art
but
could
hardly
that
with
living
here
hadn
intended
to
stay
long
but
find
the
work
interesting
and
in
no
hurry
at
present
to
move
on
expect
that
what
you
wanted
to
know
but
is
my
personal
history
really
relevant
to
rhoda
gradwyn
death
kate
said
we
can
tell
what
is
or
what
is
not
relevant
without
asking
questions
which
may
seem
an
often
they
are
we
can
only
hope
for
co
operation
and
understanding
murder
investigation
isn
social
occasion
then
let
not
treat
it
as
one
inspector
flush
flowed
quickly
over
her
pale
and
face
like
dying
rash
the
temporary
loss
of
made
her
more
human
and
surprisingly
more
attractive
she
held
her
emotions
under
control
but
they
were
there
she
was
not
thought
benton
woman
only
one
who
had
learnt
the
wisdom
of
keeping
her
under
control
he
said
how
much
contact
did
you
have
with
miss
gradwyn
either
on
her
first
visit
or
subsequently
practically
none
except
on
both
occasions
to
be
part
of
the
reception
and
to
show
her
to
her
room
we
hardly
spoke
my
job
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
patients
their
treatment
and
comfort
is
the
responsibility
of
the
two
surgeons
and
sister
holland
but
you
and
control
the
domestic
staff
find
them
when
there
vacancy
have
been
used
to
running
this
house
and
yes
they
come
under
my
general
authority
although
that
word
is
too
strong
for
the
kind
of
control
exercise
but
when
as
occasionally
happens
they
have
anything
to
do
with
the
patients
then
that
sister
holland
responsibility
suppose
there
certain
of
duties
since
responsible
for
the
kitchen
staff
and
sister
for
the
kind
of
food
the
patients
receive
but
it
seems
to
work
quite
well
did
you
sharon
bateman
placed
the
advertisement
in
number
of
papers
and
she
applied
she
was
working
at
the
time
in
home
for
the
elderly
and
presented
very
good
didn
actually
interview
her
was
at
my
london
flat
at
the
time
so
mrs
frensham
miss
westhall
and
sister
holland
saw
her
and
took
her
on
don
think
anyone
has
regretted
it
did
you
know
or
did
you
ever
meet
rhoda
gradwyn
before
she
arrived
here
never
met
her
but
of
course
heard
of
her
suppose
everyone
has
who
broadsheet
knew
her
to
be
successful
and
journalist
had
no
reason
to
think
kindly
of
her
but
personal
resentment
which
was
really
no
more
than
on
hearing
her
name
didn
make
me
wish
her
dead
my
father
was
the
last
male
cressett
and
he
lost
almost
all
the
family
money
in
the
lloyd
disaster
he
was
forced
to
sell
the
manor
and
mr
chandler
powell
bought
it
shortly
after
the
sale
rhoda
gradwyn
wrote
short
article
in
financial
paper
of
the
lloyd
names
and
in
particular
my
father
among
others
there
was
suggestion
that
those
who
were
unfortunate
had
got
what
they
deserved
she
gave
brief
description
of
the
manor
and
something
of
its
history
in
the
article
but
that
must
have
been
taken
from
since
as
far
as
any
of
us
knew
she
never
actually
been
here
some
of
my
father
friends
thought
it
was
the
article
that
killed
him
but
ve
never
believed
that
and
nor
think
did
they
it
was
an
response
to
comments
which
were
but
hardly
my
father
had
long
standing
heart
problems
and
knew
that
his
life
was
fragile
it
may
have
been
the
manor
that
was
the
final
blow
but
very
much
doubt
whether
anything
rhoda
gradwyn
could
write
or
say
would
have
troubled
him
after
all
what
was
she
an
woman
who
made
money
out
of
the
pain
of
others
someone
hated
her
enough
to
put
his
hands
round
her
throat
but
it
wasn
anyone
who
slept
here
last
night
and
now
if
you
ll
excuse
me
like
you
to
leave
shall
of
course
be
here
tomorrow
whenever
you
wish
