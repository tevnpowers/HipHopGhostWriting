to
see
me
but
ve
had
enough
excitement
for
today
it
was
not
request
they
could
refuse
the
interview
had
lasted
less
than
half
an
hour
as
they
heard
the
door
close
firmly
behind
them
benton
reflected
and
with
some
regret
that
for
thomas
over
his
was
probably
the
only
thing
the
two
of
them
had
in
common
or
were
ever
likely
to
have
perhaps
because
the
group
in
the
library
was
fresh
and
unpleasant
memory
the
suspects
as
if
by
agreement
avoided
open
discussion
of
the
murder
but
lettie
knew
that
they
spoke
of
it
herself
and
helena
the
bostocks
in
the
kitchen
which
they
had
always
regarded
as
their
home
but
now
saw
as
and
she
assumed
the
westhalls
in
stone
cottage
only
flavia
and
sharon
seemed
to
distance
themselves
from
the
others
and
kept
their
silence
flavia
herself
with
jobs
in
the
operating
suite
sharon
seeming
to
to
mog
moved
between
them
pieces
of
gossip
and
theory
like
into
hands
without
any
formal
meeting
or
agreed
it
seemed
to
lettie
that
common
theory
was
emerging
which
only
the
most
found
and
they
were
holding
their
peace
obviously
the
murder
was
an
outside
job
and
rhoda
gradwyn
herself
had
let
her
killer
into
the
manor
the
date
and
time
probably
by
agreement
before
she
left
london
that
was
why
she
had
been
so
that
no
visitors
should
be
admitted
she
was
after
all
notorious
investigative
journalist
she
must
have
made
enemies
the
car
seen
by
mog
was
probably
the
killer
and
the
light
glimpsed
at
the
stones
by
mrs
skeffington
was
his
torch
the
bolted
door
next
morning
was
difficulty
but
the
murderer
could
have
bolted
the
door
himself
after
the
and
then
hidden
himself
in
the
manor
until
the
door
was
next
morning
by
chandler
powell
there
had
after
all
been
only
search
of
the
manor
before
the
police
arrived
had
anyone
for
example
searched
the
four
empty
suites
in
the
west
wing
and
there
were
plenty
of
cupboards
in
the
manor
large
enough
to
contain
man
it
was
perfectly
possible
for
an
intruder
to
be
he
could
have
made
his
exit
by
the
west
door
and
escaped
down
the
lime
walk
to
the
field
while
the
whole
household
was
in
the
north
facing
library
being
by
commander
dalgliesh
if
the
police
hadn
been
so
anxious
to
concentrate
on
the
household
the
killer
might
have
been
caught
by
now
lettie
couldn
remember
who
first
named
robin
boyton
as
an
chief
suspect
but
when
raised
the
idea
spread
by
kind
of
after
all
he
had
come
to
stoke
cheverell
to
visit
rhoda
gradwyn
had
apparently
been
desperate
to
see
her
and
had
been
probably
the
killing
hadn
been
miss
gradwyn
had
been
perfectly
able
to
walk
after
the
operation
she
had
let
him
in
there
had
been
and
he
had
lost
his
temper
he
wasn
the
owner
of
the
car
parked
near
the
stones
but
that
might
well
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
the
police
would
be
trying
to
trace
the
owner
no
one
said
what
they
all
thought
that
it
would
be
convenient
if
they
failed
even
if
the
proved
to
be
an
over
tired
stopping
for
short
sleep
the
theory
of
an
outside
intruder
held
good
by
dinner
time
lettie
sensed
that
the
speculation
was
dying
down
it
had
been
long
and
day
and
what
they
all
now
was
period
of
peace
they
seemed
also
to
need
solitude
chandler
powell
and
flavia
told
dean
that
they
would
have
dinner
served
in
their
rooms
the
westhalls
for
stone
cottage
and
helena
invited
lettie
to
share
meal
of
and
which
she
would
cook
in
her
small
private
kitchen
after
the
meal
they
washed
up
together
then
settled
down
before
the
wood
fire
to
listen
to
concert
on
three
in
the
subdued
light
of
single
lamp
neither
mentioned
rhoda
gradwyn
death
by
eleven
the
fire
was
dying
fragile
blue
flame
at
the
last
as
it
into
grey
helena
turned
off
the
and
they
sat
in
silence
then
she
said
why
did
you
leave
the
manor
when
was
thirteen
was
it
to
do
with
father
ve
always
thought
it
was
that
you
were
lovers
lettie
replied
quietly
you
were
always
too
for
your
age
we
were
getting
too
fond
of
each
other
too
it
was
right
for
me
to
go
and
you
needed
to
be
with
other
girls
to
have
wider
education
suppose
so
that
dreadful
school
were
you
lovers
did
you
have
sex
awful
expression
but
all
are
even
once
that
why
knew
it
had
to
end
because
of
mummy
because
of
all
of
us
so
it
was
brief
encounter
without
the
something
like
that
poor
mummy
years
of
doctors
and
nurses
after
time
her
lungs
hardly
seemed
like
an
illness
just
part
of
what
she
was
and
when
she
died
hardly
missed
her
she
hadn
really
been
there
remember
being
sent
for
from
school
but
too
late
think
was
glad
not
to
be
there
in
time
but
that
empty
bedroom
that
was
horrible
still
hate
that
room
lettie
said
question
in
return
why
did
you
marry
because
he
was
funny
clever
and
very
rich
even
at
eighteen
knew
from
the
first
it
wouldn
last
that
why
we
got
married
in
london
in
office
the
seemed
less
than
in
church
couldn
resist
any
good
looking
woman
and
he
wasn
going
to
change
but
we
had
three
wonderful
years
and
he
taught
me
so
much
ll
never
regret
them
lettie
got
up
she
said
time
for
bed
thanks
for
the
dinner
and
goodnight
my
dear
and
she
was
gone
helena
moved
over
to
the
west
facing
window
and
drew
back
the
curtains
the
west
wing
was
in
darkness
no
more
than
long
shape
lit
by
the
moon
was
it
she
wondered
violent
death
that
had
released
the
impulse
to
confide
to
ask
questions
which
had
remained
for
years
she
wondered
about
lettie
and
her
marriage
there
had
been
no
children
and
she
suspected
that
this
had
been
grief
was
that
priest
she
had
married
one
who
still
thought
of
sex
as
somehow
and
saw
his
wife
and
all
women
as
and
were
that
night
for
the
question
which
was
in
both
their
minds
and
which
neither
had
dared
to
ask
until
seven
thirty
dalgliesh
had
had
little
opportunity
to
examine
and
settle
into
his
temporary
home
the
local
police
had
been
helpful
and
busy
phone
lines
had
been
checked
computer
and
large
to
the
wall
in
case
dalgliesh
should
need
to
images
thought
had
also
been
given
to
his
comfort
and
although
the
stone
cottage
had
the
faint
smell
of
house
for
some
months
wood
fire
had
been
set
and
was
blazing
in
the
the
bed
had
been
made
up
and
an
fire
provided
upstairs
the
shower
although
not
modern
very
hot
water
when
he
tested
it
and
the
had
been
with
sufficient
to
keep
him
going
for
at
least
three
days
including
of
obviously
home
made
there
were
also
of
beer
and
two
bottles
each
of
very
red
and
white
wine
by
nine
clock
he
had
showered
and
changed
and
had
up
and
eaten
the
note
found
under
the
explained
that
it
had
been
cooked
by
mrs
warren
discovery
which
dalgliesh
view
that
her
husband
temporary
to
the
squad
was
he
opened
bottle
of
the
red
wine
and
placed
it
with
three
glasses
on
low
table
before
the
fire
with
the
patterned
curtains
drawn
against
the
night
he
found
himself
as
he
sometimes
did
on
case
comfortably
in
period
of
solitude
to
spend
at
least
some
part
of
the
day
totally
alone
was
something
which
from
childhood
had
been
as
necessary
to
him
as
food
and
light
now
the
brief
over
he
took
out
his
small
personal
notebook
and
began
his
review
of
the
day
interviews
from
the
time
when
he
was
detective
sergeant
he
had
put
down
in
an
notebook
few
words
and
phrases
which
could
immediately
bring
to
mind
person
an
unwise
admission
of
dialogue
an
exchange
of
with
this
aid
he
had
almost
complete
recall
this
private
review
done
he
would
phone
kate
and
ask
her
and
benton
to
join
him
when
the
day
progress
would
be
discussed
and
he
would
set
out
the
programme
for
tomorrow
the
interviews
had
produced
no
changes
in
the
evidence
they
had
already
given
kimberley
despite
having
been
assured
by
mr
chandler
powell
that
she
had
acted
was
obviously
unhappy
seeking
to
persuade
herself
that
she
might
after
all
have
been
mistaken
alone
in
the
library
with
dalgliesh
and
kate
she
kept
at
the
door
as
if
hoping
to
see
her
husband
or
the
arrival
of
mr
chandler
powell
dalgliesh
and
kate
were
patient
with
her
asked
if
she
had
been
sure
at
the
time
that
the
voices
she
had
heard
were
those
of
mr
chandler
powell
and
sister
holland
she
had
squeezed
her
face
into
of
thought
did
think
it
was
mr
chandler
powell
and
sister
but
would
wouldn
mean
wouldn
expect
it
to
be
anyone
else
it
did
sound
like
them
or
wouldn
have
thought
that
it
was
them
would
but
can
remember
what
they
were
saying
thought
they
sounded
as
if
they
were
opened
the
sitting
room
door
just
little
and
they
weren
there
so
perhaps
they
were
in
the
bedroom
but
of
course
they
might
have
been
in
the
sitting
room
and
didn
see
them
and
did
hear
loud
voices
but
perhaps
they
were
just
talking
together
it
was
very
late
her
voice
had
kimberley
like
mrs
skeffington
if
called
for
the
would
be
gift
for
the
defence
asked
what
had
happened
next
kimberley
said
that
she
had
returned
to
where
dean
was
waiting
outside
mrs
skeffington
sitting
room
and
had
told
him
had
told
him
what
that
thought
heard
sister
with
mr
chandler
powell
and
that
why
you
didn
call
out
to
them
and
tell
sister
that
you
had
taken
tea
to
mrs
skeffington
it
like
said
in
the
library
sir
we
both
thought
sister
wouldn
like
to
be
disturbed
and
that
it
wouldn
really
matter
because
mrs
skeffington
hadn
had
her
operation
anyway
mrs
skeffington
was
all
right
she
hadn
asked
for
sister
and
if
she
wanted
her
she
could
have
rung
her
bell
kimberley
evidence
had
been
later
by
dean
he
looked
if
anything
more
than
kimberley
he
hadn
noticed
whether
the
door
to
the
lime
avenue
was
when
he
and
kimberley
took
up
the
tea
tray
but
was
that
it
was
when
they
returned
he
had
noticed
it
when
passing
the
door
he
repeated
that
he
hadn
bolted
it
because
it
was
possible
that
mr
chandler
powell
was
taking
particularly
late
walk
and
in
any
case
it
wasn
his
job
he
and
kimberley
were
the
first
to
rise
and
had
early
morning
tea
together
in
the
kitchen
at
six
clock
he
then
went
to
look
at
the
door
and
saw
that
it
was
bolted
he
had
not
thought
that
surprising
mr
chandler
powell
seldom
it
before
nine
clock
in
the
winter
months
he
hadn
told
kimberley
about
the
door
being
at
the
time
in
case
she
became
nervous
he
wasn
himself
worried
because
there
were
the
two
security
locks
he
couldn
explain
why
he
hadn
returned
later
to
check
both
the
locks
and
the
bolt
except
to
say
that
security
wasn
his
responsibility
chandler
powell
had
remained
as
calm
as
he
had
been
when
the
team
first
arrived
dalgliesh
admired
the
with
which
he
must
be
contemplating
the
of
his
clinic
possibly
of
the
greater
part
of
his
private
practice
at
the
end
of
the
interview
in
his
study
which
produced
nothing
new
kate
said
no
one
here
with
the
of
mr
boyton
says
that
they
knew
miss
gradwyn
before
she
came
to
the
manor
but
in
sense
she
isn
the
only
victim
her
death
must
the
success
of
your
work
here
is
there
anyone
who
might
have
an
interest
in
you
chandler
powell
had
said
all
can
say
is
that
have
every
confidence
in
everyone
who
works
here
and
it
seems
to
me
extremely
far
to
suggest
that
rhoda
gradwyn
was
murdered
to
inconvenience
me
the
idea
is
bizarre
dalgliesh
had
resisted
the
obvious
miss
gradwyn
death
had
been
bizarre
chandler
powell
confirmed
that
he
had
been
with
sister
holland
in
her
apartment
from
just
after
eleven
until
one
clock
neither
of
them
had
seen
or
heard
anything
unusual
there
were
medical
matters
he
needed
to
discuss
with
sister
holland
but
they
were
confidential
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
miss
gradwyn
his
evidence
had
been
confirmed
by
sister
holland
and
it
was
obvious
that
neither
had
any
intention
at
present
of
saying
more
medical
was
an
easy
excuse
for
silence
but
it
was
one
he
and
kate
had
interviewed
the
westhalls
together
in
stone
cottage
dalgliesh
had
seen
little
family
resemblance
and
the
were
by
marcus
westhall
if
conventional
good
looks
and
his
air
of
compared
with
the
strong
body
dominant
features
and
anxiety
lined
face
of
his
sister
he
had
said
little
except
to
confirm
that
he
had
had
dinner
at
the
house
of
surgeon
who
would
be
including
him
in
his
team
to
spend
year
in
africa
he
had
been
invited
to
stay
the
night
and
proposed
to
do
some
christmas
shopping
the
next
day
in
london
but
his
car
had
been
causing
trouble
and
he
had
thought
it
to
leave
promptly
after
an
early
dinner
at
eight
fifteen
so
that
he
could
take
it
in
next
morning
to
the
local
garage
he
hadn
yet
done
so
because
the
murder
had
put
everything
else
out
of
mind
the
traffic
had
been
light
but
he
had
driven
slowly
and
it
had
been
about
twelve
thirty
when
he
got
back
he
had
seen
no
one
in
the
road
and
there
were
no
lights
on
in
the
manor
stone
cottage
was
also
in
darkness
and
he
thought
that
his
sister
was
asleep
but
as
he
parked
the
car
her
light
went
on
so
he
knocked
at
her
door
looked
in
and
said
good
night
before
going
to
his
own
room
his
sister
had
seemed
perfectly
normal
but
and
had
said
that
they
would
talk
about
the
dinner
party
and
his
plans
for
the
trip
in
the
morning
the
alibi
would
be
difficult
to
challenge
unless
robin
boyton
when
questioned
had
heard
the
car
arriving
next
door
and
could
confirm
the
time
the
car
could
be
checked
but
even
if
it
were
now
running
well
westhall
could
that
he
was
unhappy
with
the
noises
it
was
making
and
felt
it
not
to
risk
being
stuck
in
london
candace
westhall
said
that
she
had
indeed
been
woken
by
the
car
and
had
spoken
to
her
brother
but
couldn
say
precisely
when
he
returned
as
she
hadn
looked
at
her
bedside
clock
she
had
gone
to
sleep
immediately
dalgliesh
had
no
difficulty
in
remembering
what
she
had
said
at
the
end
of
the
interview
he
had
always
had
almost
complete
recall
of
conversation
and
glance
at
his
notes
brought
her
words
clearly
to
mind
probably
the
only
member
of
the
household
who
expressed
dislike
of
rhoda
gradwyn
made
it
plain
to
mr
chandler
powell
that
thought
it
for
journalist
of
her
reputation
to
be
treated
at
the
manor
people
who
come
here
expect
not
only
privacy
but
absolute
women
like
gradwyn
are
always
on
the
for
stories
scandal
and
have
no
doubt
she
would
have
used
her
experience
here
in
some
way
perhaps
to
against
private
or
the
waste
of
surgeon
on
purely
with
woman
like
that
no
experience
goes
she
probably
expected
to
the
cost
of
her
treatment
doubt
whether
the
that
she
herself
was
private
patient
would
have
troubled
her
suppose
was
influenced
by
my
disgust
at
much
that
in
our
popular
press
and
that
to
gradwyn
however
didn
kill
her
and
have
no
idea
who
did
would
hardly
have
expressed
my
dislike
of
all
she
stood
for
so
if
had
murder
in
mind
can
for
her
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
pretend
that
could
she
was
after
all
stranger
but
do
feel
strong
resentment
against
the
killer
for
the
harm
he
will
do
to
the
work
here
suppose
gradwyn
death
my
warning
it
was
an
ill
day
for
everyone
at
the
manor
when
she
came
here
as
patient
mogworthy
whose
voice
and
demeanour
had
been
pitched
one
degree
short
of
what
could
reasonably
be
described
as
dumb
confirmed
his
of
the
car
but
was
unable
to
remember
anything
more
about
the
or
its
but
when
called
on
by
benton
and
dc
warren
mrs
plump
and
unexpectedly
young
woman
had
said
that
mr
mogworthy
had
indeed
shared
supper
of
and
chips
as
he
did
most
friday
nights
but
had
left
just
after
half
past
eleven
to
home
she
did
think
it
was
sad
business
that
woman
couldn
share
fish
and
supper
with
her
friend
without
the
police
coming
round
to
bother
her
comment
which
dc
warren
thought
was
intended
for
mogworthy
later
benefit
rather
than
out
of
rancour
her
final
smile
at
benton
as
they
left
had
made
it
plain
that
he
was
from
criticism
it
was
time
to
kate
and
benton
he
arranged
more
on
the
fire
and
picked
up
his
mobile
by
nine
thirty
kate
and
benton
were
back
in
wisteria
house
and
had
showered
changed
and
eaten
the
supper
served
by
mrs
shepherd
in
the
dining
room
both
liked
to
get
out
of
their
working
clothes
before
dalgliesh
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
he
would
review
the
state
of
the
investigation
and
set
out
the
programme
for
the
next
twenty
four
hours
it
was
familiar
routine
to
which
both
looked
forward
kate
with
more
confidence
than
benton
he
knew
that
ad
was
satisfied
with
him
he
wouldn
otherwise
still
be
part
of
the
team
but
he
recognised
that
he
could
be
over
in
putting
forward
which
more
thought
would
have
and
his
anxiety
to
this
tendency
to
over
enthusiasm
inhibited
so
that
the
evening
review
although
an
and
important
part
of
the
investigation
was
never
without
anxiety
since
their
arrival
at
wisteria
house
kate
and
he
had
seen
little
of
their
there
had
been
time
only
for
brief
before
they
had
left
their
bags
in
the
hall
and
returned
to
the
manor
white
visiting
card
with
the
address
and
the
names
and
shepherd
had
been
handed
to
them
on
which
the
initials
as
mrs
shepherd
explained
that
the
evening
meal
was
and
that
dinner
could
and
would
be
provided
this
had
set
off
chain
of
more
initials
in
benton
mind
hot
or
hard
beds
hot
water
bottles
kate
had
spent
only
minute
in
the
warning
already
given
by
chief
inspector
that
their
arrival
should
be
kept
private
she
did
it
with
both
she
and
benton
had
needed
no
more
than
glance
at
the
intelligent
and
serious
faces
to
know
that
they
didn
need
and
wouldn
welcome
any
reminder
of
an
assurance
already
given
mr
shepherd
had
said
we
ve
no
temptation
to
be
inspector
the
village
people
are
polite
and
not
but
they
are
little
suspicious
of
we
ve
only
been
here
for
nine
years
which
makes
us
recent
in
their
eyes
so
we
don
see
much
of
each
other
we
never
drink
in
the
cressett
arms
and
we
aren
church
he
made
the
last
statement
with
the
self
satisfaction
of
one
who
has
resisted
the
temptation
to
fall
into
dangerous
habit
the
were
kate
thought
unlikely
of
in
her
occasional
experience
of
these
useful
stopping
places
she
had
recognised
number
of
the
held
in
common
she
found
them
friendly
sometimes
fond
of
meeting
new
people
house
proud
ready
with
helpful
information
about
the
area
and
its
and
in
defiance
of
about
in
chief
of
the
full
english
breakfast
at
its
best
and
surely
their
were
older
than
most
people
who
with
the
hard
work
of
for
of
visitors
they
were
both
tall
mrs
shepherd
the
taller
and
perhaps
looked
older
than
their
years
their
mild
but
wary
eyes
were
their
firm
and
they
moved
with
none
of
the
of
old
age
mr
shepherd
with
his
thick
white
hair
cut
in
fringe
above
steel
looked
like
benign
edition
of
the
self
of
his
wife
hair
less
thick
and
now
steel
grey
was
twisted
into
long
thin
and
secured
at
the
top
of
her
head
by
two
their
voices
were
an
distinctive
upper
class
accent
which
can
so
those
not
in
possession
of
it
and
which
kate
told
herself
would
have
them
from
any
hope
of
job
at
the
or
even
career
in
politics
had
either
unlikely
option
to
them
kate
bedroom
held
everything
necessary
for
comfortable
night
and
nothing
she
guessed
that
benton
room
next
door
was
probably
identical
two
single
beds
side
by
side
were
covered
with
immaculate
white
the
bedside
lamps
were
modern
to
reading
and
there
was
two
drawer
chest
and
small
wardrobe
provided
with
wooden
the
bathroom
had
no
bath
but
shower
which
preliminary
turn
of
the
showed
to
be
the
soap
was
but
expensive
and
on
opening
the
bathroom
cabinet
she
saw
that
it
was
with
the
necessary
which
some
visitors
might
have
neglected
to
pack
in
cover
and
shower
as
an
early
kate
regretted
the
absence
of
kettle
and
other
for
morning
tea
but
small
notice
on
the
chest
of
drawers
informed
her
that
tea
could
be
brought
up
at
any
time
between
six
and
nine
on
request
although
newspapers
wouldn
be
until
eight
thirty
she
exchanged
her
shirt
for
one
freshly
drew
on
and
picking
up
her
jacket
joined
benton
in
the
hall
at
first
they
stepped
out
into
an
and
blackness
benton
torch
its
strong
as
transformed
the
stones
and
the
path
into
disconcerting
and
the
shape
of
bushes
and
trees
as
kate
eyes
became
to
the
night
one
by
one
the
stars
became
visible
against
the
of
black
and
grey
through
which
half
moon
slipped
and
reappeared
the
narrow
road
and
making
the
darkness
they
walked
without
speaking
their
shoes
on
the
like
and
threatening
alien
the
peace
of
the
night
except
kate
thought
that
it
wasn
peace
even
in
the
stillness
she
could
hear
the
faint
in
the
and
from
time
to
time
distant
almost
human
cry
the
of
kill
and
be
killed
was
being
played
out
under
cover
of
darkness
rhoda
gradwyn
wasn
the
only
living
that
had
died
on
that
friday
night
some
fifty
yards
on
they
passed
the
westhalls
cottage
with
one
light
in
an
upstairs
window
and
two
shining
from
the
windows
of
the
ground
floor
within
yards
to
the
left
was
the
parking
space
the
black
shed
and
beyond
glimpse
of
the
cheverell
circle
the
stones
no
more
than
half
imagined
shapes
until
the
parted
under
the
moon
and
they
stood
pale
and
seeming
to
moon
above
the
black
fields
and
now
they
were
at
the
old
police
cottage
with
its
light
shining
from
the
two
ground
floor
windows
as
they
approached
dalgliesh
opened
the
door
looking
for
second
unfamiliar
in
checked
open
necked
shirt
and
there
was
wood
fire
burning
the
air
and
faint
dalgliesh
had
pulled
three
comfortable
low
chairs
before
the
fire
with
an
oak
coffee
table
between
them
on
it
stood
an
open
bottle
of
red
wine
three
glasses
and
plan
of
the
manor
kate
felt
an
of
her
heart
this
routine
at
the
end
of
the
day
was
like
coming
home
when
the
time
came
to
accept
with
the
inevitable
change
of
job
these
were
the
moments
she
would
miss
the
talk
would
be
of
death
and
murder
sometimes
in
its
most
horrific
form
but
in
memory
these
sessions
at
the
end
of
the
day
would
hold
the
warmth
and
security
the
sense
of
being
valued
which
in
childhood
she
had
never
known
there
was
desk
before
the
window
holding
dalgliesh
laptop
telephone
and
thick
file
of
papers
beside
it
and
bulging
briefcase
propped
against
the
table
leg
he
had
brought
some
of
his
other
work
with
him
she
thought
he
looks
tired
it
isn
good
enough
he
been
for
weeks
and
felt
surge
of
an
emotion
which
she
knew
she
could
never
express
they
settled
themselves
round
the
table
looking
at
kate
dalgliesh
asked
are
you
comfortable
at
the
you
ve
had
meal
very
comfortable
thank
you
sir
mrs
shepherd
did
us
well
home
made
soup
fish
pie
and
what
was
that
sweet
sergeant
you
know
about
food
queen
of
ma
am
dalgliesh
said
chief
inspector
has
arranged
with
the
that
they
take
no
other
visitors
while
you
are
there
they
ought
to
be
for
any
loss
but
no
doubt
this
has
been
arranged
the
local
force
has
been
it
can
have
been
easy
benton
broke
in
don
think
the
will
be
bothered
about
other
visitors
sir
mrs
shepherd
said
they
haven
any
and
don
expect
any
they
ve
only
got
the
two
rooms
anyway
they
re
busy
in
the
spring
and
summer
but
mostly
with
regular
visitors
and
they
re
if
people
arrive
they
don
like
the
look
of
they
immediately
put
the
no
sign
in
the
window
kate
said
so
who
don
they
like
the
look
of
people
with
large
expensive
cars
and
the
kind
who
ask
to
see
the
rooms
before
they
never
refuse
women
arriving
alone
or
people
without
cars
who
are
obviously
desperate
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
have
their
staying
for
the
weekend
but
he
in
an
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
chief
inspector
knows
about
him
and
he
ll
keep
his
mouth
shut
they
love
their
but
not
his
kate
said
who
told
you
all
this
mrs
shepherd
when
she
showed
me
to
my
room
kate
didn
comment
on
benton
to
information
without
asking
for
it
obviously
mrs
shepherd
was
as
to
handsome
and
young
man
as
most
of
her
sex
dalgliesh
poured
the
wine
then
spread
the
plan
of
the
manor
on
the
table
he
said
let
be
absolutely
plain
about
the
of
the
house
as
you
see
it
shaped
south
facing
and
with
and
the
entrance
hall
great
hall
dining
room
and
library
are
in
the
main
part
of
the
house
as
is
also
the
kitchen
the
bostocks
occupy
two
rooms
above
the
kitchen
and
sharon
bateman
room
is
next
to
them
the
west
wing
at
the
rear
has
been
as
accommodation
for
the
patients
the
ground
floor
the
operating
suite
which
the
theatre
room
for
the
recovery
suite
the
nurses
and
and
at
the
end
the
lift
large
enough
for
but
not
for
goes
up
to
the
second
floor
where
there
is
sister
holland
sitting
room
bedroom
and
bathroom
then
the
patients
rooms
the
first
suite
occupied
by
mrs
skeffington
then
rhoda
gradwyn
and
the
spare
suite
at
the
end
all
with
sitting
rooms
and
the
windows
from
the
bedrooms
look
out
over
the
lime
avenue
to
the
cheverell
stones
and
those
in
the
east
facing
rooms
over
the
knot
garden
mr
chandler
powell
is
on
the
first
floor
of
the
east
wing
miss
cressett
and
mrs
frensham
on
the
ground
floor
the
rooms
at
the
top
are
spare
bedrooms
occasionally
used
for
medical
and
nursing
staff
who
may
need
to
stay
the
night
he
paused
then
looked
at
kate
who
took
over
our
problem
is
that
we
have
group
of
seven
people
in
the
manor
any
of
whom
could
have
killed
miss
gradwyn
all
knew
where
she
was
sleeping
knew
that
the
suites
beyond
were
possible
hiding
place
knew
where
the
surgical
gloves
were
kept
and
all
either
had
or
could
have
keys
to
the
west
door
and
although
the
westhalls
are
non
resident
they
knew
gradwyn
room
and
have
keys
to
the
front
door
and
the
one
leading
to
the
lime
walk
if
marcus
westhall
didn
return
to
stone
cottage
until
twelve
thirty
he
probably
in
the
clear
but
he
hasn
been
able
to
provide
witness
he
could
very
well
have
got
back
earlier
and
his
explanation
of
why
he
decided
to
return
here
last
night
is
odd
if
he
feared
the
car
might
be
wouldn
it
have
been
to
stay
in
london
and
get
it
fixed
rather
than
risk
on
the
motorway
and
then
there
robin
boyton
it
whether
he
knew
where
miss
gradwyn
was
sleeping
and
he
wouldn
have
been
given
house
key
but
he
is
the
only
one
to
have
known
the
victim
personally
and
he
he
booked
into
rose
cottage
because
she
was
here
mr
chandler
powell
is
that
he
bolted
the
door
to
the
lime
walk
promptly
at
eleven
clock
if
the
murderer
came
from
outside
and
was
stranger
to
the
manor
he
would
have
had
to
be
let
in
by
one
of
the
household
told
where
to
find
his
victim
provided
with
gloves
and
eventually
let
out
again
the
door
bolted
behind
him
the
strong
possibility
is
that
this
was
an
inside
job
which
makes
motive
of
prime
importance
dalgliesh
said
it
usually
unwise
to
concentrate
too
early
or
too
strongly
on
motive
people
kill
for
variety
of
reasons
some
even
by
the
killer
and
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
rhoda
gradwyn
might
not
have
been
the
victim
was
this
directed
against
chandler
powell
for
example
did
the
murderer
want
to
destroy
the
clinic
or
had
he
double
motive
to
get
rid
of
gradwyn
and
chandler
powell
it
difficult
to
imagine
more
than
the
brutal
and
murder
of
patient
chandler
powell
calls
the
motive
bizarre
but
it
has
to
be
kept
in
mind
benton
said
mrs
skeffington
for
one
won
be
back
sir
it
may
be
unwise
to
concentrate
too
much
and
too
early
on
motive
but
can
imagine
chandler
powell
or
sister
holland
killing
patient
mr
chandler
powell
apparently
made
good
job
of
that
scar
it
his
job
would
rational
man
destroy
his
own
and
can
see
the
bostocks
as
he
and
kimberley
seem
to
have
very
comfortable
here
is
dean
bostock
going
to
throw
up
good
job
that
leaves
us
with
candace
westhall
mogworthy
miss
cressett
mrs
frensham
sharon
bateman
and
robin
boyton
and
as
far
as
we
know
none
has
motive
for
gradwyn
benton
stopped
and
looked
round
kate
thought
in
some
embarrassment
at
going
down
path
which
dalgliesh
might
not
have
wanted
to
open
up
without
dalgliesh
said
well
let
be
clear
what
we
ve
learnt
so
far
we
ll
leave
motive
for
the
moment
benton
will
you
begin
kate
knew
that
her
chief
always
asked
the
most
member
of
the
team
to
the
discussion
benton
silence
on
their
walk
suggested
that
he
had
already
spent
some
time
deciding
how
best
to
dalgliesh
hadn
made
it
clear
whether
benton
was
meant
to
review
the
facts
or
to
comment
on
them
or
both
but
invariably
if
he
didn
kate
would
and
she
suspected
that
this
often
was
what
dalgliesh
had
in
mind
benton
took
of
his
wine
he
had
given
thought
to
what
he
would
say
on
the
walk
to
the
old
police
cottage
now
he
was
he
gave
an
account
of
rhoda
gradwyn
involvement
with
chandler
powell
and
the
cheverell
manor
clinic
from
her
appointment
with
him
in
his
street
consulting
room
on
november
until
the
time
of
her
death
she
had
had
choice
of
private
bed
in
st
angela
in
london
or
cheverell
manor
she
chose
the
manor
at
least
and
came
for
preliminary
visit
on
november
when
the
member
of
staff
who
saw
most
of
her
was
sharon
who
showed
her
the
garden
this
was
little
surprising
since
contact
with
the
patients
was
usually
with
more
members
of
staff
or
with
the
two
surgeons
and
sister
holland
on
thursday
the
of
december
she
went
straight
to
her
suite
after
being
received
on
arrival
by
mr
chandler
powell
sister
holland
and
mrs
frensham
all
say
she
was
perfectly
calm
apparently
and
not
very
one
of
the
temporary
non
resident
staff
nurse
frazer
took
her
down
to
the
operating
theatre
next
morning
where
she
was
examined
by
the
anaesthetist
and
then
the
operation
mr
chandler
powell
says
it
was
complicated
but
successful
she
was
in
the
recovery
room
until
four
thirty
when
she
was
returned
to
her
suite
on
the
patients
wing
she
ate
light
supper
and
was
seen
by
sister
holland
on
several
occasions
and
by
chandler
powell
and
sister
holland
at
ten
clock
when
miss
gradwyn
said
she
was
ready
to
sleep
she
refused
sedative
sister
holland
said
that
the
last
time
she
looked
in
on
her
was
at
eleven
when
she
found
miss
gradwyn
asleep
she
was
murdered
by
dr
glenister
between
eleven
and
twelve
thirty
dalgliesh
and
kate
listened
in
silence
benton
was
seized
by
the
fear
that
he
was
taking
too
much
time
on
the
obvious
he
glanced
at
kate
but
getting
no
response
went
on
we
ve
been
told
of
several
things
that
happened
that
night
the
only
other
patient
present
mrs
skeffington
was
and
went
to
the
bathroom
she
could
have
been
woken
by
the
sound
of
the
lift
which
she
says
she
heard
at
eleven
forty
from
the
bedroom
window
she
she
saw
light
flickering
among
the
cheverell
stones
this
was
just
before
midnight
it
frightened
her
and
she
rang
the
assistant
cook
kimberley
bostock
and
asked
for
pot
of
tea
probably
she
wanted
company
however
briefly
but
didn
like
to
wake
up
sister
holland
who
was
in
the
suite
next
door
kate
said
didn
she
admit
as
much
when
kimberley
and
dean
brought
up
the
tea
benton
said
she
certainly
seemed
to
prefer
kimberley
bostock
to
sister
holland
seems
reasonable
to
me
sir
mrs
bostock
wondered
whether
she
should
have
the
tea
as
she
was
having
an
operation
the
next
morning
she
knew
she
ought
to
check
with
sister
holland
leaving
dean
standing
outside
mrs
skeffington
suite
she
knocked
on
sister
door
and
peered
in
kate
said
she
said
she
heard
chandler
powell
said
talking
it
was
chandler
powell
obviously
feels
his
admission
an
alibi
for
both
him
and
sister
holland
of
course
that
on
the
actual
time
of
death
he
to
be
unsure
exactly
when
he
went
to
sister
holland
suite
and
she
too
is
surprisingly
vague
by
leaving
the
time
so
uncertain
they
avoided
the
mistake
of
an
alibi
for
the
actual
time
of
death
which
is
always
suspicious
or
leaving
themselves
with
no
alibi
it
possible
that
by
the
time
they
were
together
one
or
both
of
them
had
killed
rhoda
gradwyn
benton
said
can
we
be
little
more
precise
about
the
time
of
death
mrs
skeffington
says
she
heard
the
lift
descending
when
she
first
woke
up
and
before
she
rang
for
tea
she
put
that
at
about
eleven
forty
the
lift
is
opposite
sister
holland
suite
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
it
modern
and
comparatively
quiet
but
we
ve
checked
and
it
perfectly
possible
to
hear
it
if
there
no
other
noise
kate
said
but
there
was
apparently
the
wind
quite
strongly
last
night
but
if
she
heard
it
why
didn
sister
holland
unless
of
course
she
and
chandler
powell
were
in
the
bedroom
and
too
busy
to
hear
or
having
sex
which
doesn
either
way
there
no
hope
of
expecting
kimberley
to
stand
firm
on
her
evidence
benton
went
on
without
if
they
been
in
the
sitting
room
one
of
them
would
surely
have
heard
kimberley
when
she
knocked
on
the
door
or
seen
her
when
she
half
opened
it
no
one
to
using
the
lift
that
night
at
any
time
except
the
bostocks
when
they
brought
up
the
tea
if
mrs
skeffington
evidence
is
accurate
it
seems
reasonable
to
place
the
time
of
death
at
about
eleven
thirty
glancing
at
dalgliesh
benton
paused
and
kate
took
over
it
pity
she
can
be
more
accurate
about
the
time
when
she
heard
the
lift
and
saw
the
lights
if
there
difference
between
them
longer
for
example
than
it
would
take
to
walk
from
the
bottom
of
the
lift
to
the
stones
then
there
must
be
two
people
involved
the
murderer
can
be
descending
in
the
lift
and
shining
torch
at
the
stones
at
the
same
time
two
people
maybe
two
different
and
if
there
was
the
two
obvious
suspects
are
the
westhalls
the
other
evidence
is
dean
bostock
statement
about
the
back
door
leading
to
the
lime
walk
the
door
has
two
security
locks
but
chandler
powell
is
he
bolts
it
every
night
at
eleven
clock
unless
he
knows
member
of
the
household
is
still
out
he
absolutely
sure
he
bolted
the
door
as
usual
and
found
it
bolted
in
the
morning
the
first
thing
he
did
after
getting
up
at
six
thirty
was
to
turn
off
the
alarm
system
and
check
the
west
door
to
the
lime
walk
benton
broke
in
and
dean
bostock
checked
the
bolt
when
he
got
up
at
six
is
there
chance
we
may
get
from
the
bolt
kate
said
not
chance
say
chandler
powell
unlocked
the
door
when
he
and
marcus
westhall
went
out
to
search
the
grounds
and
the
stone
circle
and
remember
that
of
this
killer
wasn
about
to
leave
prints
dalgliesh
said
if
we
assume
that
neither
chandler
powell
nor
bostock
was
lying
and
don
think
bostock
was
then
someone
in
the
house
that
door
after
eleven
clock
either
to
leave
the
manor
or
to
let
someone
in
or
of
course
both
that
us
to
mogworthy
of
car
parked
near
the
stones
shortly
before
midnight
miss
gradwyn
was
killed
either
by
someone
who
was
already
in
the
manor
that
night
member
of
staff
or
someone
else
who
had
gained
access
or
by
someone
from
outside
and
even
if
that
person
had
the
two
security
keys
he
or
she
couldn
gain
access
until
the
door
was
but
we
can
go
on
talking
about
he
or
she
the
murderer
needs
name
the
murderer
was
always
given
name
by
the
team
since
dalgliesh
strongly
disliked
the
usual
and
usually
it
was
benton
who
it
now
he
said
we
usually
make
it
he
sir
so
why
not
woman
for
change
or
an
name
which
would
do
for
either
sex
the
murderer
came
by
night
how
about
by
or
from
the
night
dalgliesh
said
that
seems
appropriate
it
is
but
let
keep
him
male
for
the
present
kate
said
we
re
still
back
with
the
problem
of
motive
we
know
that
candace
westhall
tried
to
persuade
chandler
powell
not
to
let
rhoda
gradwyn
come
to
the
manor
if
westhall
had
murder
in
mind
why
chandler
powell
from
her
unless
of
course
it
was
double
and
isn
it
possible
that
this
was
an
death
that
hadn
got
murder
in
mind
when
he
went
to
that
room
dalgliesh
said
against
that
of
course
is
the
use
of
gloves
and
their
afterwards
benton
said
but
if
it
was
why
now
with
only
one
other
patient
and
all
the
non
resident
staff
absent
the
circle
of
suspects
is
bound
to
be
smaller
kate
was
impatient
it
had
to
be
now
she
wasn
planning
to
return
she
was
killed
because
she
was
here
in
the
manor
and
relatively
it
just
question
of
whether
the
murderer
took
advantage
of
that
fact
or
actually
to
ensure
that
gradwyn
chose
not
only
this
particular
surgeon
but
the
manor
instead
of
bed
in
london
which
on
the
face
of
it
would
have
been
more
convenient
for
her
london
was
her
city
her
life
was
london
based
why
here
and
that
us
on
to
why
her
so
called
friend
robin
boyton
booked
in
at
the
same
time
we
haven
interviewed
him
yet
but
he
certainly
got
some
questions
to
answer
what
exactly
is
their
relationship
and
then
there
his
urgent
message
on
gradwyn
mobile
he
was
obviously
pretty
desperate
to
see
her
he
seemed
upset
at
her
death
but
how
much
of
that
was
play
acting
he
cousin
of
the
westhalls
and
apparently
he
at
the
visitors
cottage
fairly
regularly
he
could
have
got
access
to
keys
and
had
them
on
one
of
his
previous
visits
or
he
may
have
been
given
them
by
rhoda
gradwyn
she
could
have
deliberately
taken
the
keys
home
with
her
on
her
first
visit
with
the
intention
of
having
them
and
how
do
we
know
he
didn
get
access
to
the
manor
earlier
that
day
and
hide
himself
in
the
suite
at
the
end
of
the
patients
corridor
we
know
from
the
of
that
was
there
it
could
have
been
before
as
well
as
after
the
murder
who
was
likely
to
look
in
there
benton
said
whoever
killed
her
doubt
whether
she
ll
be
much
missed
here
or
anywhere
she
seems
to
have
caused
lot
of
damage
in
her
the
investigative
journalist
get
your
story
take
the
cash
never
mind
the
pain
dalgliesh
said
our
job
is
to
decide
who
killed
her
not
to
make
moral
don
go
down
that
path
sergeant
benton
said
but
don
we
always
make
moral
sir
even
if
we
don
voice
them
isn
it
important
to
know
as
much
as
we
can
about
the
victim
good
or
ill
people
die
because
of
who
they
are
and
what
they
are
isn
that
part
of
the
evidence
feel
differently
about
the
death
of
child
young
person
the
innocent
dalgliesh
said
innocent
so
you
feel
confident
to
make
the
distinction
between
the
victims
who
death
and
those
who
don
you
haven
yet
been
part
of
an
investigation
into
the
murder
of
child
have
you
no
sir
benton
thought
you
knew
that
already
you
didn
need
to
ask
if
and
when
you
are
the
pain
you
ll
have
to
witness
will
you
with
more
questions
emotional
and
even
than
the
one
you
ll
be
there
to
answer
who
did
this
moral
outrage
is
natural
without
it
we
re
hardly
human
but
for
detective
faced
with
the
dead
body
of
child
the
young
the
innocent
making
an
arrest
can
become
personal
campaign
and
that
dangerous
it
can
judgement
every
victim
the
same
commitment
benton
wanted
to
say
know
that
sir
ll
try
to
give
it
but
the
words
struck
him
as
the
response
of
guilty
schoolboy
to
criticism
he
said
nothing
kate
broke
the
silence
and
for
all
our
how
much
in
the
end
do
we
ever
really
know
the
victim
the
suspects
the
killer
why
wonder
did
rhoda
gradwyn
come
here
benton
said
to
get
rid
of
that
scar
dalgliesh
said
scar
she
had
had
for
thirty
four
years
why
now
why
this
place
why
did
she
need
to
keep
it
and
why
now
to
get
rid
of
it
if
we
knew
that
we
might
get
closer
to
knowing
something
about
the
woman
and
you
re
quite
right
benton
she
died
because
of
who
and
what
she
was
benton
instead
of
sergeant
well
that
was
something
he
thought
wish
knew
who
you
are
but
that
was
part
of
the
fascination
of
this
job
he
served
boss
who
remained
an
to
him
and
always
would
kate
said
isn
sister
holland
behaviour
this
morning
bit
odd
when
kim
phoned
to
say
that
miss
gradwyn
hadn
rung
for
her
tea
wouldn
it
be
more
natural
for
sister
holland
to
check
at
once
if
her
patient
was
all
right
rather
than
asking
kim
to
bring
up
the
tea
wondering
whether
she
was
taking
care
to
ensure
that
there
was
witness
with
her
when
she
found
the
body
did
she
already
know
that
miss
gradwyn
was
dead
benton
said
chandler
powell
says
that
he
left
sister
holland
room
at
one
clock
wouldn
it
be
natural
thing
for
her
to
check
then
on
her
patient
she
might
well
have
done
so
and
known
that
gradwyn
was
dead
when
she
asked
kimberley
to
bring
up
the
tea
it
always
to
have
witness
when
you
find
the
body
but
that
doesn
mean
that
she
killed
her
as
said
earlier
can
see
either
chandler
powell
or
sister
holland
the
life
out
of
patient
particularly
one
they
had
just
operated
on
kate
looked
as
if
she
was
ready
to
argue
but
said
nothing
it
was
late
and
dalgliesh
knew
that
they
were
all
tired
it
was
time
to
set
out
the
programme
for
the
next
day
he
and
kate
would
drive
to
london
to
see
what
evidence
could
be
from
rhoda
gradwyn
house
in
the
city
benton
and
dc
warren
would
remain
at
the
manor
dalgliesh
had
seeing
robin
boyton
in
the
hope
that
by
tomorrow
he
would
have
down
and
be
ready
to
co
operate
the
were
for
benton
with
dc
warren
to
interview
boyton
if
possible
to
trace
the
car
seen
parked
near
the
cheverell
stones
to
with
the
scene
of
crime
officers
who
were
expected
to
finish
their
work
by
midday
and
to
maintain
police
presence
at
the
manor
and
ensure
that
the
security
by
mr
chandler
powell
kept
clear
of
the
scene
dr
glenister
report
on
the
post
mortem
was
expected
by
midday
and
benton
would
ring
dalgliesh
as
soon
as
this
had
been
received
apart
from
these
he
would
of
course
use
his
in
deciding
whether
any
of
the
suspects
should
be
questioned
again
it
was
nearly
midnight
before
benton
carried
the
three
wine
glasses
into
the
kitchen
to
wash
and
he
and
kate
set
out
to
make
their
way
back
through
the
sweet
smelling
rain
washed
darkness
to
wisteria
house
book
three
december
london
dorset
dorset
dalgliesh
and
kate
left
stoke
cheverell
before
six
clock
an
early
start
planned
partly
because
of
dalgliesh
strong
dislike
of
getting
in
the
heavy
morning
traffic
but
also
because
he
needed
the
extra
time
in
london
there
were
papers
on
which
he
had
been
working
to
be
to
the
yard
confidential
report
his
comments
to
be
collected
and
note
to
be
left
on
his
secretary
desk
this
done
he
and
kate
drove
in
silence
through
the
almost
empty
streets
for
dalgliesh
as
for
many
the
early
hours
of
sunday
morning
in
the
city
held
particular
appeal
for
five
the
air
with
energy
so
that
one
can
believe
that
its
great
is
being
physically
out
with
sweat
and
exhaustion
in
some
engine
room
by
friday
afternoon
the
slowly
stop
and
to
watch
the
city
in
their
thousands
over
the
to
their
is
to
see
this
mass
less
as
matter
of
will
than
of
to
some
old
compulsion
by
early
sunday
morning
the
city
so
far
from
settling
itself
for
deeper
sleep
lies
silently
awaiting
the
of
summoned
by
to
old
in
their
carefully
and
to
walk
down
quiet
remembered
streets
even
the
river
seems
to
flow
more
slowly
they
found
parking
space
some
hundred
yards
from
and
dalgliesh
gave
final
glance
at
the
took
his
murder
bag
from
the
car
and
they
set
off
the
narrow
entrance
under
stone
for
such
narrow
opening
would
have
been
easy
to
miss
the
lit
by
two
wall
mounted
lamps
which
merely
was
small
with
centre
an
age
possibly
of
religious
but
now
no
more
than
shapeless
mass
of
stone
number
eight
was
on
the
side
the
door
painted
green
so
dark
that
it
looked
almost
black
and
with
an
iron
in
the
shape
of
an
next
to
number
eight
was
shop
which
sold
old
prints
with
wooden
tray
outside
now
empty
second
building
was
obviously
but
gave
no
sign
of
the
type
of
workers
it
hoped
to
attract
other
doors
bore
small
polished
with
unfamiliar
names
the
silence
was
absolute
the
door
had
been
fitted
with
two
security
locks
but
there
was
no
problem
in
the
right
keys
from
miss
gradwyn
bunch
and
the
door
opened
easily
dalgliesh
put
out
his
hand
and
found
the
light
they
entered
small
room
oak
panelled
and
with
an
ceiling
the
date
window
at
the
rear
gave
view
of
with
room
for
little
more
than
tree
in
an
immense
pot
there
was
row
of
coat
to
the
right
with
shelf
beneath
for
shoes
and
on
the
left
rectangular
oak
table
it
held
four
clearly
either
bills
or
which
dalgliesh
thought
had
probably
arrived
before
miss
gradwyn
left
on
thursday
for
the
manor
and
which
she
had
judged
could
well
her
return
the
only
picture
was
small
oil
painting
of
century
man
with
long
sensitive
face
which
hung
above
the
stone
fireplace
and
which
dalgliesh
on
first
thought
was
copy
of
the
well
known
of
john
he
switched
on
the
strip
of
lighting
fixed
to
on
the
and
studied
it
for
moment
in
silence
hanging
alone
in
room
which
was
place
of
passage
it
acquired
an
power
perhaps
as
the
of
the
home
off
the
light
dalgliesh
wondered
if
that
was
how
rhoda
gradwyn
had
seen
it
wooden
uncarpeted
led
to
the
first
floor
here
at
the
front
was
the
kitchen
with
small
dining
room
at
the
back
the
kitchen
was
well
arranged
and
the
room
of
woman
who
knew
how
to
cook
although
neither
it
nor
the
dining
room
showed
any
signs
of
recent
use
they
mounted
the
second
flight
there
was
guest
bedroom
with
two
single
beds
the
identical
tightly
stretched
and
the
shower
and
lavatory
again
neither
room
bore
any
signs
of
the
room
above
was
almost
but
the
bedroom
here
with
one
single
bed
only
was
obviously
miss
gradwyn
bedside
table
held
modern
lamp
clock
whose
sounded
loud
in
the
silence
and
three
books
of
of
charles
and
collection
of
modern
short
stories
the
bathroom
shelf
held
very
few
and
and
kate
stretching
out
her
hand
in
feminine
curiosity
drew
back
neither
dalgliesh
nor
she
entered
the
private
world
of
the
victim
without
an
awareness
that
their
presence
although
necessary
was
of
privacy
kate
he
knew
had
always
drawn
distinction
between
the
objects
they
needed
to
examine
and
take
away
and
natural
curiosity
about
life
which
had
escaped
for
ever
from
any
human
power
either
to
hurt
or
she
merely
said
it
doesn
look
as
if
she
tried
to
the
scar
finally
they
moved
to
the
top
and
entered
room
which
ran
the
length
of
the
house
with
windows
to
both
east
and
west
giving
of
the
city
only
here
did
dalgliesh
begin
to
feel
strongly
that
he
was
in
mental
touch
with
the
owner
in
this
room
she
had
lived
worked
rested
watched
television
listened
to
music
needing
no
one
and
nothing
that
was
not
within
those
four
walls
one
was
almost
completely
covered
with
an
carved
bookcase
with
shelves
he
saw
that
it
had
been
important
to
her
as
it
was
to
him
that
books
should
neatly
fit
the
height
of
the
shelves
her
mahogany
desk
was
to
the
left
of
the
bookcase
and
looked
it
was
rather
than
with
drawers
on
each
side
the
right
ones
locked
above
was
shelf
holding
of
box
files
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
was
comfortable
sofa
with
an
easy
chair
facing
the
television
with
small
and
to
the
right
of
the
black
victorian
grate
high
backed
armchair
the
equipment
was
modern
but
to
the
left
of
the
window
there
was
small
with
tray
on
top
holding
an
coffee
and
single
mug
here
with
in
the
bathroom
one
below
she
could
make
herself
drink
without
having
to
go
down
three
to
the
kitchen
not
an
easy
house
to
live
in
but
it
was
one
in
which
he
too
could
have
felt
at
home
he
and
kate
moved
about
the
room
without
speaking
he
saw
that
the
east
facing
window
gave
access
to
small
wrought
iron
with
iron
steps
leading
to
the
roof
he
opened
the
window
to
the
cold
of
the
morning
and
climbed
up
kate
didn
follow
his
own
flat
high
above
the
at
was
within
walking
distance
and
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
river
even
if
he
had
time
or
needed
to
go
there
he
knew
he
wouldn
find
emma
although
she
had
key
she
never
visited
the
flat
when
she
was
in
london
unless
he
was
there
it
was
he
knew
part
of
her
and
careful
of
herself
from
his
job
wish
that
amounted
almost
to
an
obsession
not
to
his
privacy
privacy
which
she
respected
because
she
understood
and
shared
it
lover
was
not
an
or
to
be
possessed
there
was
always
some
part
of
the
personality
which
remained
when
they
first
fell
in
love
she
would
fall
asleep
at
night
in
his
arms
and
he
would
stir
in
the
small
hours
reaching
for
her
but
knowing
she
was
no
longer
there
it
was
to
the
guest
room
that
he
took
her
early
morning
tea
this
happened
less
often
now
at
first
the
had
worried
him
inhibited
from
asking
her
partly
because
he
feared
to
know
the
answer
he
had
arrived
at
his
own
because
he
didn
or
perhaps
wouldn
speak
openly
about
the
reality
of
his
job
she
needed
to
separate
the
lover
from
the
detective
they
could
talk
about
her
cambridge
job
and
frequently
did
sometimes
happily
because
they
shared
passion
for
his
offered
no
common
ground
she
wasn
fool
or
over
sensitive
she
recognised
the
importance
of
his
work
but
he
knew
that
it
still
lay
between
them
like
he
had
been
on
the
roof
for
less
than
minute
from
this
high
and
private
place
rhoda
gradwyn
would
have
watched
the
touching
the
city
and
and
painting
them
with
light
now
down
he
joined
kate
he
said
we
better
get
started
on
the
files
they
seated
themselves
side
by
side
at
the
desk
all
the
boxes
were
neatly
the
one
named
sanctuary
court
contained
her
copy
of
the
complicated
lease
now
he
saw
with
sixty
seven
years
with
her
solicitor
details
and
to
and
her
agent
and
solicitor
both
had
named
files
in
another
under
were
her
bank
and
regular
from
her
private
on
the
state
of
her
looking
through
them
dalgliesh
was
surprised
how
well
she
was
doing
she
was
worth
nearly
two
million
pounds
the
clearly
balanced
between
and
government
kate
said
you
would
expect
to
see
these
in
one
of
the
locked
drawers
she
didn
seem
worried
that
an
intruder
might
find
out
exactly
what
she
was
worth
probably
because
she
thought
the
house
secure
or
perhaps
she
didn
care
she
didn
live
like
rich
woman
we
can
hope
to
learn
who
is
going
to
benefit
from
this
when
gets
here
with
the
will
they
turned
their
attention
to
the
rank
of
files
containing
of
all
her
press
and
each
box
with
the
years
covered
contained
the
in
date
order
some
in
plastic
covers
they
took
file
each
and
settled
down
to
work
dalgliesh
said
note
anything
she
wrote
that
however
to
cheverell
manor
or
any
of
the
people
there
for
almost
an
hour
they
worked
in
silence
then
kate
slid
bunch
of
press
across
the
desk
she
said
this
is
interesting
sir
it
long
article
in
the
review
about
in
the
spring
number
in
it
seems
to
have
notice
there
number
of
newspaper
including
report
of
an
inquest
and
another
of
with
photograph
she
passed
it
across
one
of
the
people
at
the
grave
side
looks
very
like
miss
westhall
dalgliesh
took
glass
from
his
murder
bag
and
studied
the
picture
the
woman
was
and
standing
little
apart
from
the
group
of
only
her
head
was
visible
and
the
face
was
partly
obscured
but
dalgliesh
after
minute
had
little
trouble
with
the
he
handed
the
glass
to
kate
and
said
yes
it
candace
westhall
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
article
he
was
fast
and
it
was
easy
to
get
the
the
article
was
intelligent
well
written
and
and
he
read
it
with
genuine
interest
and
growing
respect
it
dealt
with
cases
of
and
he
thought
fairly
some
from
the
distant
past
others
more
recent
some
notorious
many
new
to
him
rhoda
gradwyn
was
interesting
about
apparently
unconscious
of
phrases
and
ideas
and
the
occasional
