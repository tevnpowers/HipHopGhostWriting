and
intimidating
like
they
had
slipped
the
of
their
over
their
heads
and
put
on
their
white
but
little
work
had
been
done
at
half
past
nine
at
miss
cressett
request
dean
had
taken
and
and
large
of
coffee
into
the
library
but
the
plates
later
found
that
little
had
been
eaten
although
the
coffee
was
empty
and
the
demand
for
it
seemed
sister
holland
regularly
appeared
to
bear
off
another
dean
was
beginning
to
feel
that
he
was
in
his
own
kitchen
they
could
sense
that
the
house
was
locked
in
an
silence
even
the
wind
had
dropped
its
dying
like
kim
was
ashamed
of
her
faint
mr
chandler
powell
had
been
very
kind
to
her
and
had
said
that
she
wasn
to
return
to
work
until
she
felt
ready
but
she
was
glad
to
be
back
where
she
belonged
with
dean
in
the
kitchen
mr
chandler
powell
had
been
grey
faced
and
looked
much
older
and
somehow
different
he
reminded
kim
of
how
her
dad
had
looked
when
he
came
home
after
his
operation
as
if
strength
and
something
more
than
strength
something
that
made
him
her
dad
had
drained
out
of
him
everyone
had
been
kind
to
her
but
she
felt
that
the
sympathy
had
been
carefully
as
if
any
words
could
be
dangerous
if
murder
had
happened
at
home
in
her
village
how
different
it
would
have
been
the
of
outrage
and
horror
the
arms
round
her
the
whole
street
pouring
into
the
house
to
see
hear
and
jumble
of
voices
questioning
and
the
people
at
the
manor
weren
like
that
mr
chandler
powell
mr
westhall
and
his
sister
and
miss
cressett
didn
show
their
feelings
at
least
not
in
public
they
must
have
feelings
everyone
did
kim
knew
she
cried
too
easily
but
surely
they
cried
sometimes
although
it
seemed
an
even
to
imagine
it
sister
holland
eyes
had
been
red
and
swollen
perhaps
she
had
cried
was
it
because
she
had
lost
patient
but
didn
nurses
get
used
to
that
she
wished
she
knew
what
was
happening
outside
the
kitchen
which
despite
its
size
had
become
dean
had
told
her
that
mr
chandler
powell
had
spoken
to
everyone
in
the
library
he
had
said
that
the
patients
wing
and
the
lift
were
out
of
but
that
people
should
carry
on
normally
as
far
as
possible
the
police
would
want
to
question
everyone
but
in
the
meantime
he
that
they
should
avoid
talking
among
themselves
about
miss
gradwyn
death
but
kim
knew
that
they
would
be
discussing
it
not
in
but
in
pairs
the
westhalls
who
had
returned
to
stone
cottage
miss
cressett
with
mrs
frensham
and
surely
mr
chandler
powell
with
sister
mog
would
probably
keep
silent
he
could
if
it
paid
him
and
she
couldn
imagine
anyone
discussing
miss
gradwyn
with
sharon
she
and
dean
certainly
wouldn
if
she
came
into
the
kitchen
but
she
and
dean
had
talked
quietly
as
if
that
could
somehow
make
their
words
and
now
kim
couldn
resist
again
going
over
the
same
ground
suppose
the
police
ask
me
exactly
what
happened
when
took
up
mrs
skeffington
tea
every
single
detail
must
tell
them
dean
was
trying
to
be
patient
she
heard
it
in
his
voice
kim
we
ve
settled
that
yes
you
tell
them
if
they
ask
direct
question
we
have
to
answer
and
tell
the
truth
otherwise
we
re
in
trouble
but
what
happened
isn
important
you
didn
see
anyone
or
talk
to
anyone
it
can
have
anything
to
do
with
miss
gradwyn
death
you
could
make
and
for
no
good
reason
keep
quiet
until
they
ask
and
you
re
sure
about
the
door
sure
but
if
the
police
start
me
about
it
ll
probably
end
up
being
sure
of
nothing
kim
said
it
very
quiet
isn
it
thought
someone
would
be
here
by
now
ought
we
to
be
here
by
ourselves
dean
said
we
were
told
to
get
on
with
our
work
the
kitchen
is
where
we
work
and
this
is
where
you
belong
here
with
me
he
came
over
and
took
her
into
his
arms
they
stood
for
minute
and
she
was
her
he
said
anyway
we
ought
to
think
about
lunch
it
already
half
past
one
so
far
all
anyone
has
been
able
to
face
is
coffee
and
biscuits
they
ll
want
something
hot
sooner
or
later
and
they
won
fancy
the
the
had
been
made
the
previous
day
and
was
ready
to
in
the
bottom
of
the
enough
had
been
made
for
the
whole
household
and
for
mog
when
he
came
in
from
working
in
the
garden
but
now
even
the
rich
smell
of
it
would
make
her
sick
dean
said
no
they
won
want
anything
heavy
could
make
soup
we
ve
got
that
stock
from
the
and
then
perhaps
sandwiches
eggs
his
voice
faded
kim
said
but
don
think
mog
has
gone
for
the
fresh
bread
mr
chandler
powell
said
that
we
ought
to
stay
here
we
could
make
some
bread
that
always
popular
what
about
the
police
will
we
have
to
feed
them
you
said
you
didn
feed
chief
inspector
when
he
arrived
except
for
coffee
but
this
new
lot
are
coming
from
london
they
ll
have
had
long
drive
don
know
ll
have
to
ask
mr
chandler
powell
and
then
kim
remembered
how
odd
she
thought
that
she
had
forgotten
she
said
it
was
today
we
were
going
to
tell
him
about
the
baby
after
mrs
skeffington
operation
now
they
know
and
they
don
seem
worried
miss
cressett
says
there
plenty
of
room
in
the
manor
for
baby
kim
thought
she
detected
small
note
of
impatience
even
of
subdued
satisfaction
in
dean
voice
he
said
it
no
good
deciding
whether
we
want
to
stay
on
here
with
the
baby
when
we
don
even
know
if
the
clinic
can
continue
who
want
to
come
here
now
would
you
want
to
sleep
in
that
room
glancing
at
him
kim
saw
his
features
momentarily
as
if
in
resolution
and
then
the
door
opened
and
they
turned
to
face
mr
chandler
powell
glancing
at
his
watch
chandler
powell
saw
that
it
was
one
forty
perhaps
he
should
now
have
word
with
the
bostocks
who
were
in
the
kitchen
he
needed
to
check
again
that
kimberley
had
fully
and
that
they
were
giving
thought
to
food
no
one
had
yet
eaten
the
six
hours
since
the
murder
was
discovered
had
seemed
an
in
which
small
events
were
recalled
with
in
waste
of
time
the
murder
room
as
chief
inspector
had
finding
the
roll
of
in
the
of
his
desk
forgetting
to
seal
the
end
so
that
it
back
and
the
roll
became
helena
taking
it
from
him
and
at
her
suggestion
the
to
ensure
that
it
wasn
with
he
had
no
awareness
of
the
growing
of
the
light
of
darkness
becoming
grey
winter
morning
of
the
occasional
of
the
dying
wind
like
erratic
despite
the
of
memory
the
confusion
of
time
he
was
confident
that
he
had
done
what
was
expected
of
him
with
mrs
skeffington
kimberley
bostock
and
giving
directions
for
her
care
trying
to
keep
everyone
calm
during
the
interminable
wait
until
the
local
police
arrived
the
smell
of
hot
coffee
the
house
seeming
to
why
had
he
ever
found
it
he
wondered
if
he
would
ever
again
smell
it
without
of
remembered
failure
familiar
faces
had
become
those
of
strangers
carved
faces
like
those
of
patients
unexpected
pain
faces
seeming
as
as
themselves
for
the
of
someone
little
known
but
taking
on
in
death
terrifying
power
flavia
face
the
swollen
eyes
by
tears
yet
he
hadn
actually
seen
her
cry
and
the
only
words
he
could
remember
her
speaking
had
struck
him
as
you
did
beautiful
job
now
she
ll
never
see
it
and
she
waited
so
long
all
that
time
and
skill
wasted
just
wasted
they
had
both
lost
patient
the
only
death
which
had
occurred
in
his
clinic
at
the
manor
were
her
tears
the
tears
of
frustration
or
failure
they
could
hardly
surely
be
of
grief
and
now
he
would
have
to
deal
with
the
bostocks
he
must
face
their
for
reassurance
comfort
decisions
on
matters
which
would
seem
but
which
wouldn
be
to
them
he
had
said
all
that
was
necessary
at
that
meeting
at
eight
fifteen
in
the
library
there
at
least
he
had
taken
responsibility
he
had
set
out
to
be
brief
and
he
had
been
brief
his
voice
had
been
calm
authoritative
they
would
all
have
learnt
by
now
of
the
tragedy
that
would
touch
their
lives
miss
rhoda
gradwyn
had
been
found
dead
in
her
room
at
seven
thirty
this
morning
there
was
some
evidence
that
the
death
had
been
unnatural
well
he
thought
that
was
one
way
of
putting
it
the
police
had
been
phoned
and
chief
inspector
from
the
local
was
on
his
way
naturally
they
would
all
co
operate
with
police
enquiries
in
the
meantime
they
should
stay
calm
from
gossip
or
speculation
and
get
on
with
their
work
what
work
exactly
he
wondered
mrs
skeffington
operation
had
been
the
anaesthetist
and
theatre
staff
had
been
telephoned
flavia
and
helena
between
them
had
with
that
and
after
this
brief
speech
avoiding
questions
he
had
left
the
library
but
hadn
that
exit
all
eyes
on
him
been
gesture
of
responsibility
he
remembered
standing
for
moment
outside
the
door
like
stranger
in
the
house
wondering
where
to
go
and
now
seated
at
the
kitchen
table
with
dean
and
kimberley
he
was
expected
to
concern
himself
with
soup
and
bread
from
the
moment
of
entering
room
which
he
seldom
had
need
to
visit
he
felt
as
as
an
intruder
what
reassurance
what
comfort
were
they
expecting
from
him
the
two
faces
his
were
those
of
frightened
children
seeking
the
answer
to
question
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
bread
or
soup
his
irritation
at
their
obvious
need
for
firm
instructions
he
was
about
to
say
just
do
what
you
think
best
when
he
heard
helena
footsteps
she
had
come
up
quietly
behind
him
and
now
he
heard
her
voice
soup
is
an
excellent
idea
hot
and
as
you
ve
got
the
stock
it
could
be
quickly
made
let
keep
the
food
simple
shall
we
we
don
want
it
to
look
like
parish
serve
the
bread
warm
and
with
plenty
of
board
would
be
good
to
the
cold
people
should
have
some
but
don
it
make
it
look
as
you
always
do
no
one
will
be
hungry
but
they
ll
need
to
eat
and
it
would
be
good
idea
to
put
out
kimberley
excellent
home
made
and
with
the
bread
people
in
shock
often
something
sweet
and
keep
the
coffee
coming
plenty
of
coffee
kimberley
said
will
we
need
to
feed
the
police
miss
cressett
shouldn
think
so
no
doubt
we
ll
learn
that
in
time
as
you
know
chief
inspector
won
be
this
investigation
now
they
re
sending
special
squad
from
the
police
imagine
they
ll
have
fed
on
the
road
you
re
being
both
of
you
as
you
always
are
life
is
likely
to
be
disturbed
for
all
of
us
for
some
time
but
know
you
ll
cope
if
you
have
any
questions
come
to
me
the
bostocks
murmured
their
thanks
chandler
powell
and
helena
moved
out
together
he
said
trying
but
without
success
to
his
voice
with
warmth
thank
you
should
have
left
the
bostocks
to
you
and
what
on
earth
is
bread
made
with
and
without
you
ve
eaten
it
here
often
enough
you
like
it
at
least
we
ve
out
the
next
meal
seem
to
have
spent
the
morning
on
wish
to
god
this
commander
dalgliesh
and
his
squad
would
arrive
and
get
on
with
the
investigation
we
ve
got
distinguished
forensic
pathologist
around
until
dalgliesh
to
arrive
why
can
she
get
on
with
her
job
and
got
something
better
to
do
than
kicking
his
heels
here
helena
said
and
why
the
met
the
dorset
police
are
perfectly
competent
so
why
can
chief
inspector
take
on
the
investigation
it
makes
me
wonder
whether
there
might
not
be
something
secret
and
important
about
rhoda
gradwyn
something
we
don
know
there
always
been
something
we
don
know
about
rhoda
gradwyn
they
had
passed
into
the
front
hall
there
was
the
firm
closing
of
car
doors
the
sound
of
voices
helena
said
you
best
get
to
the
front
door
it
sounds
as
if
the
squad
from
the
met
has
arrived
it
was
good
day
for
drive
into
the
country
day
on
which
dalgliesh
would
usually
take
his
time
and
parking
from
time
to
time
to
enjoy
gazing
at
the
of
the
great
trees
stripped
for
winter
the
rising
and
the
dark
of
the
high
patterned
against
sky
had
been
but
now
he
drove
under
the
white
ball
of
winter
sun
its
blue
as
clear
as
on
summer
day
its
light
would
soon
but
now
under
its
strong
the
fields
low
hills
and
of
trees
were
sharp
edged
and
once
free
of
the
traffic
of
london
they
made
good
time
and
two
and
half
hours
later
they
were
in
east
dorset
driving
into
lay
by
they
stopped
briefly
to
eat
their
lunch
and
dalgliesh
his
fifteen
minutes
later
they
came
to
them
to
stoke
cheverell
and
about
mile
past
the
village
pointing
to
cheverell
manor
they
drew
up
in
front
of
two
wrought
iron
gates
and
saw
beyond
them
an
avenue
of
trees
inside
the
gates
an
elderly
man
wrapped
in
long
overcoat
was
sitting
in
what
looked
like
kitchen
chair
reading
newspaper
he
folded
it
carefully
taking
his
time
then
to
open
the
high
gates
dalgliesh
wondered
whether
to
get
out
to
help
him
but
the
gates
swung
open
easily
enough
and
he
drove
through
kate
and
benton
following
the
old
man
closed
the
gates
behind
them
then
came
up
to
the
car
he
said
miss
cressett
don
like
cars
the
drive
you
ll
ave
to
go
round
the
back
of
the
east
wing
dalgliesh
said
we
ll
do
that
but
it
can
wait
the
three
of
them
pulled
their
murder
bags
out
of
the
cars
even
the
of
the
moment
the
knowledge
that
group
of
people
was
awaiting
him
in
various
of
anxiety
or
apprehension
didn
dalgliesh
from
pausing
for
few
seconds
to
look
at
the
house
he
knew
that
it
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
tudor
manor
houses
in
england
and
now
it
was
before
him
in
its
of
form
its
confident
of
grace
and
strength
house
built
for
for
birth
death
and
of
passage
by
men
who
knew
what
they
believed
and
what
they
were
doing
house
in
history
there
was
no
grass
or
garden
and
no
in
front
of
the
manor
it
presented
itself
its
dignity
needing
no
he
was
seeing
it
at
its
best
the
white
morning
glare
of
sunlight
had
softened
the
of
the
trees
and
the
stones
of
the
manor
in
glow
so
that
for
moment
in
the
stillness
it
seemed
to
and
become
as
as
vision
the
daylight
would
soon
it
was
the
month
of
the
winter
would
fall
and
night
would
follow
quickly
he
and
the
team
would
be
investigating
of
darkness
in
the
blackness
of
for
someone
who
loved
the
light
this
imposed
which
was
as
much
as
as
he
and
the
team
moved
forward
the
door
of
the
great
porch
opened
and
man
came
out
to
them
he
seemed
for
moment
uncertain
whether
to
then
held
out
his
hand
and
said
chief
inspector
keith
you
ve
made
good
time
sir
the
chief
said
you
be
wanting
we
ve
only
got
couple
available
at
present
but
they
should
be
here
within
forty
minutes
the
photographer
on
his
way
there
could
thought
dalgliesh
be
no
doubt
that
was
policeman
either
that
or
he
was
heavily
built
but
held
himself
upright
he
had
plain
but
agreeable
face
his
eyes
steady
and
watchful
under
hair
the
colour
of
old
cut
and
neatly
shaped
round
over
large
ears
he
was
dressed
in
country
and
wearing
the
made
he
said
have
you
any
knowledge
why
the
met
are
taking
the
case
sir
none
afraid
take
it
you
were
surprised
when
the
phoned
know
the
chief
thought
it
bit
odd
but
we
re
not
looking
for
work
you
ll
have
heard
about
those
on
the
we
ve
got
the
and
boys
all
over
us
the
yard
said
you
could
do
with
dc
leaving
warren
he
bit
on
the
quiet
side
but
bright
enough
and
he
knows
when
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
dalgliesh
said
quiet
and
ve
no
with
that
where
is
he
now
outside
the
bedroom
the
body
the
household
well
the
six
most
important
members
suppose
are
waiting
in
the
great
hall
that
mr
george
chandler
powell
who
owns
the
place
his
assistant
mr
marcus
westhall
he
surgeon
so
they
call
him
mr
his
sister
miss
candace
westhall
flavia
holland
the
sister
in
charge
miss
helena
cressett
who
kind
of
housekeeper
secretary
and
general
administrator
as
far
as
can
make
out
and
mrs
frensham
who
does
the
an
impressive
of
memory
chief
inspector
not
really
sir
mr
chandler
powell
newcomer
but
most
people
know
who
at
the
manor
has
dr
glenister
arrived
an
hour
ago
sir
she
had
tea
and
done
of
the
garden
had
word
with
mog
he
by
way
of
being
the
to
tell
him
he
over
the
and
now
she
in
the
hall
unless
she
gone
for
another
walk
lady
very
fond
of
exercise
say
well
it
makes
change
from
the
smell
of
dalgliesh
asked
when
did
you
get
here
twenty
minutes
after
receiving
the
phone
call
from
mr
chandler
powell
was
getting
set
to
act
as
chief
investigating
officer
when
the
chief
rang
to
tell
me
that
the
yard
were
taking
over
any
thoughts
inspector
dalgliesh
question
was
partly
by
this
wasn
his
patch
time
might
or
might
not
why
the
home
office
had
taken
hand
but
apparent
acceptance
of
the
department
involvement
didn
mean
that
he
liked
it
say
it
an
inside
job
sir
if
it
is
you
ve
got
limited
number
of
suspects
which
in
my
experience
doesn
make
the
case
any
easier
to
crack
not
if
they
ve
all
got
their
about
them
which
reckon
most
of
these
will
have
they
were
approaching
the
porch
the
door
opened
as
if
someone
had
been
watching
to
time
exactly
the
moment
of
arrival
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
of
the
man
who
moved
to
one
side
as
they
entered
he
was
grave
faced
and
with
the
strained
of
man
in
shock
but
had
lost
none
of
his
authority
this
was
his
house
and
he
was
in
control
both
of
it
and
of
himself
without
holding
out
hand
or
gazing
at
dalgliesh
he
said
george
chandler
powell
the
rest
of
the
party
are
in
the
great
hall
they
followed
him
through
the
porch
and
to
door
to
the
left
of
the
square
entrance
hall
surprisingly
the
heavy
oak
door
was
shut
and
chandler
powell
opened
it
dalgliesh
wondered
whether
he
had
intended
this
first
sight
of
the
hall
to
be
so
dramatic
he
experienced
an
extraordinary
moment
in
which
colours
shape
and
sounds
the
roof
the
great
on
the
right
hand
wall
the
of
winter
on
an
oak
table
to
the
left
of
the
door
the
row
of
portraits
in
their
some
objects
clearly
seen
even
in
first
glance
others
perhaps
from
some
memory
or
fantasy
seemed
to
into
living
picture
which
immediately
his
mind
the
five
people
who
were
waiting
on
each
side
of
the
fire
their
faces
turned
towards
him
looked
like
arranged
to
give
the
room
its
and
there
was
minute
oddly
because
it
seemed
an
inappropriate
in
which
dalgliesh
and
chandler
powell
quickly
made
their
chandler
powell
were
hardly
necessary
the
only
other
male
had
to
be
marcus
westhall
the
pale
faced
woman
with
the
distinctive
features
helena
cressett
the
shorter
dark
woman
and
the
only
one
whose
face
bore
signs
of
possible
tears
sister
flavia
holland
the
tall
elderly
woman
standing
on
the
fringe
of
the
group
seemed
to
have
been
overlooked
by
chandler
powell
now
she
came
quietly
forward
shook
dalgliesh
hand
and
said
frensham
do
the
chandler
powell
said
understand
you
already
know
dr
glenister
dalgliesh
went
over
to
her
chair
and
they
shook
hands
she
was
the
only
person
still
seated
and
it
was
apparent
from
the
tea
service
on
table
beside
her
that
she
had
been
served
tea
she
wore
the
same
clothes
as
he
remembered
from
their
last
meeting
trousers
tucked
into
leather
and
tweed
jacket
which
looked
too
heavy
for
her
frame
wide
hat
which
she
invariably
wore
at
now
rested
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
without
it
her
head
the
half
visible
through
the
short
white
hair
looked
as
vulnerable
as
child
her
features
were
delicate
and
her
skin
so
pale
that
occasionally
she
looked
like
woman
ill
but
she
was
and
her
eyes
so
dark
they
were
almost
black
were
the
eyes
of
much
younger
woman
dalgliesh
would
have
preferred
as
he
always
did
his
long
standing
colleague
dr
but
he
was
glad
enough
to
see
someone
he
liked
and
respected
and
with
whom
he
had
worked
before
dr
glenister
was
one
of
the
most
highly
regarded
forensic
in
an
of
distinguished
on
the
subject
and
witness
in
court
but
her
presence
was
an
unwelcome
reminder
of
number
ten
interest
the
distinguished
dr
glenister
tended
to
be
called
in
when
the
government
was
involved
getting
to
her
feet
with
the
ease
of
young
woman
she
said
commander
dalgliesh
and
are
old
colleagues
well
shall
we
get
started
mr
chandler
powell
like
you
to
come
up
if
commander
dalgliesh
has
no
dalgliesh
said
none
he
was
probably
the
only
police
officer
whom
dr
glenister
would
invite
to
in
any
decision
of
hers
he
recognised
the
problem
there
were
medical
details
which
only
chandler
powell
could
provide
but
there
were
things
she
and
dalgliesh
might
want
to
say
which
it
would
be
unwise
to
discuss
over
the
body
with
chandler
powell
present
chandler
powell
had
to
be
suspect
dr
glenister
knew
it
and
so
no
doubt
did
chandler
powell
they
crossed
the
square
entrance
hall
and
climbed
the
staircase
chandler
powell
and
dr
glenister
leading
their
feet
sounded
loud
on
the
uncarpeted
wood
the
stairs
led
to
landing
the
door
to
the
right
was
open
and
dalgliesh
could
glimpse
long
low
room
with
an
ceiling
chandler
powell
said
the
long
gallery
sir
there
when
he
visited
the
manor
apart
from
the
it
still
as
it
was
then
no
one
second
and
shorter
flight
of
stairs
led
to
door
which
opened
on
to
passage
with
rooms
facing
west
and
east
chandler
powell
said
the
patients
accommodation
is
on
this
corridor
suites
with
sitting
room
bedroom
and
shower
immediately
underneath
the
long
gallery
has
been
furnished
as
joint
sitting
room
most
patients
prefer
to
stay
in
their
suite
or
occasionally
to
use
the
library
on
the
ground
floor
sister
holland
rooms
are
the
first
facing
west
opposite
the
lift
there
was
no
need
to
point
out
which
room
rhoda
gradwyn
had
occupied
police
officer
seated
at
the
door
up
as
they
appeared
and
dalgliesh
said
you
re
detective
warren
yes
sir
how
long
have
you
been
on
guard
since
inspector
and
arrived
sir
that
was
at
five
past
eight
the
was
already
in
place
chandler
powell
said
was
to
seal
the
door
by
inspector
dalgliesh
the
away
and
he
entered
the
sitting
room
with
kate
and
benton
following
there
was
strong
smell
of
vomit
strangely
at
odds
with
the
of
the
room
the
door
to
the
bedroom
was
to
the
left
it
was
closed
and
chandler
powell
pushed
it
gently
open
against
the
of
fallen
tray
the
cups
broken
and
the
its
lid
detached
lying
on
its
side
the
bedroom
was
in
darkness
lit
only
by
the
daylight
in
from
the
sitting
room
the
dark
of
tea
the
carpet
chandler
powell
said
left
things
exactly
as
found
them
no
one
has
entered
this
room
since
sister
and
left
it
suppose
this
mess
can
be
cleared
up
once
the
body
has
been
moved
dalgliesh
said
not
until
the
scene
has
been
searched
the
room
was
not
small
but
with
five
people
it
suddenly
seemed
crowded
it
was
little
smaller
than
the
sitting
room
but
furnished
with
an
elegance
which
intensified
the
dark
horror
of
what
lay
on
the
bed
with
kate
and
benton
at
the
rear
they
approached
the
body
dalgliesh
switched
on
the
light
at
the
door
and
then
turned
to
the
bedside
lamp
he
saw
that
the
was
missing
and
that
the
with
its
red
call
had
been
high
above
the
bed
they
stood
by
the
body
in
silence
chandler
powell
keeping
little
distant
aware
that
he
might
be
there
under
the
bed
faced
the
window
which
was
closed
and
with
the
curtains
drawn
rhoda
gradwyn
was
lying
on
her
back
her
two
arms
the
hands
clenched
were
raised
above
her
head
as
if
in
gesture
of
surprise
the
dark
hair
over
the
pillow
the
left
side
of
her
face
was
covered
by
surgical
dressing
but
what
flesh
could
be
seen
was
bright
red
the
right
eye
in
death
was
fully
open
the
left
partly
obscured
by
the
thick
dressing
was
half
closed
giving
the
body
bizarre
and
look
of
corpse
peering
from
an
eye
not
yet
dead
the
sheet
covered
her
body
up
to
the
shoulders
as
if
her
killer
were
deliberately
his
framed
by
the
two
narrow
of
her
white
linen
the
cause
of
death
was
she
had
been
by
human
hand
dalgliesh
knew
that
fixed
on
corpse
his
own
among
them
were
different
from
the
fixed
on
living
flesh
even
for
professional
to
the
sight
of
violent
death
there
would
always
be
of
pity
anger
or
horror
the
best
and
police
officers
standing
where
they
stood
now
never
lost
respect
for
the
dead
respect
born
of
shared
emotions
however
temporary
the
recognition
of
common
common
end
but
all
all
personality
was
with
the
last
breath
the
body
already
subject
to
the
process
of
had
been
to
an
to
be
treated
with
serious
professional
concern
focus
for
emotions
it
could
no
longer
share
no
more
be
troubled
by
now
the
only
physical
was
with
hands
on
body
laid
open
like
the
of
an
animal
this
was
not
the
most
horrific
corpse
he
had
seen
in
his
years
as
detective
but
now
it
seemed
to
hold
career
of
pity
anger
and
he
thought
perhaps
ve
had
enough
of
murder
the
room
in
which
she
lay
like
the
sitting
room
through
which
they
had
passed
despite
its
comfort
was
too
carefully
furnished
an
which
for
him
was
and
impersonal
the
objects
he
had
glimpsed
as
he
passed
through
the
sitting
room
to
her
bedside
arranged
themselves
in
his
memory
the
writing
desk
the
two
modern
easy
chairs
before
stone
grate
fitted
with
an
the
mahogany
bookcase
and
arranged
to
their
advantage
and
yet
they
were
rooms
in
which
he
would
never
have
felt
at
home
they
reminded
him
of
country
house
hotel
once
and
only
once
visited
where
the
guests
were
subtly
made
to
feel
in
their
taste
to
that
of
the
no
were
allowed
he
wondered
who
had
arranged
the
rooms
presumably
miss
cressett
if
so
she
was
trying
to
convey
that
this
part
of
the
manor
was
merely
short
stay
hotel
visitors
were
here
to
be
impressed
but
not
to
take
over
even
temporary
possession
rhoda
gradwyn
may
have
felt
differently
may
even
have
been
at
home
here
but
the
room
for
her
had
not
been
by
the
of
murder
turning
to
chandler
powell
dr
glenister
said
you
had
of
course
seen
her
the
evening
before
naturally
and
is
this
how
you
found
her
this
morning
yes
when
saw
her
throat
knew
that
there
was
nothing
could
do
that
there
was
no
possibility
that
this
was
natural
death
it
hardly
needs
forensic
pathologist
to
how
she
died
she
been
what
you
see
now
is
exactly
what
saw
when
first
approached
the
bed
dalgliesh
asked
were
you
alone
was
alone
at
the
bedside
sister
holland
was
in
the
sitting
room
with
kimberley
bostock
the
assistant
cook
who
had
brought
up
the
early
morning
tea
when
she
saw
the
body
sister
pressed
the
red
call
in
the
sitting
room
several
times
so
knew
that
there
was
some
kind
of
as
you
ll
see
the
one
by
the
bed
has
been
out
of
reach
very
sister
holland
didn
touch
it
she
has
assured
me
that
it
was
lying
as
usual
on
the
bedside
table
when
she
settled
the
patient
for
the
night
thought
that
probably
the
patient
had
or
was
ill
and
expected
to
find
sister
here
also
to
the
call
we
shut
both
doors
and
carried
kimberley
down
to
her
own
apartment
called
her
husband
to
stay
with
her
and
immediately
telephoned
the
local
police
chief
inspector
me
about
the
room
and
was
here
in
charge
until
you
arrived
had
already
arranged
for
this
corridor
and
the
lift
to
be
out
of
dr
glenister
had
been
bending
over
the
body
but
without
touching
it
now
she
straightened
herself
and
said
she
was
by
right
handed
grip
the
hand
probably
in
smooth
there
is
by
the
right
hand
fingers
and
but
no
ll
know
more
when
have
her
on
the
table
she
turned
to
chandler
powell
there
one
question
please
did
you
any
for
her
yesterday
night
offered
her
but
she
said
she
didn
need
it
she
had
come
out
of
the
anaesthetic
well
had
had
light
supper
and
was
now
feeling
she
thought
she
have
no
difficulty
in
sleeping
sister
holland
was
the
last
person
to
see
her
apart
of
course
from
her
murderer
and
all
she
asked
for
was
glass
of
hot
milk
with
brandy
sister
holland
waited
while
she
drank
and
then
removed
the
glass
it
has
of
course
now
been
washed
dr
glenister
said
think
the
will
find
it
useful
if
they
could
have
list
of
all
the
that
you
keep
in
the
here
or
any
drugs
to
which
patient
could
have
had
access
or
been
given
thank
you
mr
chandler
powell
dalgliesh
said
it
would
be
helpful
to
have
preliminary
talk
with
you
alone
perhaps
in
ten
minutes
time
need
to
get
an
idea
of
the
here
and
the
number
and
of
the
staff
and
how
miss
gradwyn
came
to
be
your
patient
chandler
powell
said
ll
be
in
the
general
office
it
inside
the
porch
opposite
the
great
hall
ll
look
out
plan
of
the
manor
for
you
they
waited
until
they
heard
his
footsteps
in
the
next
room
and
the
closing
of
the
corridor
door
now
dr
glenister
took
her
surgical
gloves
from
the
bag
and
gently
touched
gradwyn
face
then
her
neck
and
arms
the
forensic
pathologist
had
been
teacher
and
dalgliesh
knew
from
experience
of
working
with
her
that
she
could
seldom
resist
the
opportunity
to
the
young
she
said
to
benton
no
doubt
you
know
all
about
sergeant
no
ma
am
know
it
in
the
about
three
hours
after
death
then
down
through
the
face
and
neck
to
the
and
finally
the
trunk
and
lower
the
is
generally
complete
in
about
twelve
hours
and
to
wear
off
in
order
after
about
thirty
six
hours
and
do
you
think
that
is
assessment
of
the
time
of
death
not
entirely
ma
am
not
at
all
it
can
be
complicated
by
the
of
the
room
the
condition
of
the
subject
the
cause
of
death
and
by
some
which
may
but
are
different
that
bodies
exposed
to
great
heat
and
you
know
what
that
is
sergeant
yes
ma
am
it
can
at
the
instant
of
death
the
muscles
of
the
hand
so
that
anything
the
dead
person
may
have
been
clutching
is
difficult
to
the
assessment
of
an
accurate
time
of
death
is
one
of
the
most
important
of
medical
and
one
of
the
most
difficult
one
development
is
the
of
the
amount
of
in
the
of
the
eye
here
shall
know
more
precisely
when
ve
taken
the
and
done
the
post
mortem
in
the
meantime
can
give
preliminary
assessment
based
on
the
you
know
what
that
is
sure
yes
ma
am
post
mortem
which
we
see
here
probably
at
its
height
based
on
that
and
the
present
development
of
my
preliminary
would
be
that
she
died
between
eleven
and
twelve
thirty
probably
closer
to
the
first
relieved
sergeant
that
you
re
not
likely
to
become
one
of
those
investigative
officers
who
expect
the
forensic
pathologist
to
provide
an
accurate
within
minutes
of
the
body
the
words
were
it
was
then
that
the
telephone
on
the
bedside
table
rang
the
bell
was
and
unexpected
the
seeming
of
the
privacy
of
the
dead
for
few
seconds
no
one
moved
except
dr
glenister
who
went
calmly
over
to
her
bag
as
if
she
were
stone
dalgliesh
picked
up
the
receiver
it
was
voice
the
photographer
has
arrived
and
the
two
are
on
their
way
sir
if
could
just
hand
over
to
one
of
your
team
ll
be
on
my
way
dalgliesh
said
thank
you
ll
be
down
he
had
seen
all
he
needed
to
at
the
bedside
he
wasn
sorry
to
be
spared
dr
glenister
examination
of
the
body
he
said
the
photographer
has
arrived
can
send
him
up
if
that
convenient
for
you
dr
glenister
said
need
more
than
another
ten
minutes
then
yes
send
him
up
ll
phone
for
the
mortuary
van
as
soon
as
he
done
no
doubt
the
people
here
will
be
glad
to
see
the
body
leave
and
then
we
can
have
word
before
go
kate
had
been
silent
throughout
as
they
walked
down
the
stairs
dalgliesh
said
to
benton
cope
with
the
photographer
and
will
you
benton
they
can
get
started
after
the
body
has
been
removed
we
ll
take
prints
later
but
not
hopeful
of
getting
anything
probably
any
one
of
the
staff
here
could
have
entered
the
room
at
some
time
or
other
kate
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
general
office
chandler
powell
should
have
the
name
of
rhoda
gradwyn
next
of
kin
possibly
also
her
solicitor
someone
will
have
to
break
the
news
and
that
will
probably
be
best
done
by
the
local
police
whoever
they
are
and
we
need
to
know
great
deal
more
about
this
place
the
what
staff
chandler
powell
has
and
when
they
re
here
whoever
her
could
have
been
using
surgical
gloves
most
people
know
that
you
can
get
prints
from
the
inside
of
gloves
so
they
ll
probably
have
been
destroyed
and
the
need
to
pay
attention
to
the
lift
and
now
kate
we
ll
see
what
mr
chandler
powell
has
to
say
to
us
in
the
office
chandler
powell
was

time

him

dalgliesh
said
and
rhoda
gradwyn
how
did
she
come
to
be
patient
first
saw
her
in
street
on
the
of
november
she
wasn
referred
by
her
gp
as
is
general
but
had
word
with
him
she
came
for
the
of
deep
scar
on
her
left
cheek
saw
her
once
at
st
angela
hospital
where
she
and
briefly
when
she
arrived
on
thursday
afternoon
she
was
also
here
on
the
of
november
for
preliminary
visit
and
stayed
for
two
nights
but
we
didn
meet
on
that
occasion
never
met
her
before
she
came
to
street
and
have
no
idea
why
she
chose
the
manor
assumed
she
had
checked
on
the
reputation
of
surgeons
and
given
choice
of
london
or
dorset
chose
the
manor
because
she
wanted
privacy
know
nothing
about
her
except
her
reputation
as
journalist
and
of
course
her
medical
history
at
our
first
interview
found
her
very
calm
very
very
clear
about
what
she
wanted
one
thing
was
interesting
asked
her
why
she
had
waited
so
long
to
get
rid
of
the
and
why
now
she
replied
because
no
longer
have
need
of
it
there
was
silence
then
dalgliesh
said
have
to
ask
you
this
have
you
any
idea
who
is
responsible
for
miss
gradwyn
death
if
you
have
suspicions
or
if
there
is
anything
should
know
please
tell
me
now
so
you
re
that
this
is
what
you
no
doubt
call
an
inside
job
nothing
but
rhoda
gradwyn
was
your
patient
killed
in
your
house
but
not
by
one
of
my
staff
don
dalgliesh
said
doubt
very
much
whether
this
is
the
work
of
nor
am
that
member
of
your
staff
was
responsible
he
went
on
would
miss
gradwyn
have
been
physically
capable
of
leaving
her
room
and
taking
the
lift
to
the
ground
floor
to
the
door
of
the
west
wing
chandler
powell
said
it
would
be
perfectly
possible
after
she
had
fully
consciousness
but
as
she
was
constantly
while
she
was
in
the
recovery
room
and
visited
every
half
hour
after
she
was
wheeled
back
to
her
suite
at
four
thirty
the
only
possibility
would
have
been
after
ten
clock
when
she
had
been
settled
for
the
night
then
in
my
view
she
would
have
been
physically
capable
of
leaving
her
suite
although
there
would
of
course
have
been
possibility
that
someone
would
have
seen
her
and
she
would
have
needed
set
of
keys
she
couldn
have
taken
set
from
the
key
cupboard
in
the
office
without
setting
off
the
alarm
this
of
the
manor
shows
how
the
system
works
the
front
door
the
great
hall
library
dining
room
and
office
are
all
protected
but
not
the
west
wing
where
we
on
bolts
and
keys
am
responsible
at
night
for
setting
the
alarm
miss
cressett
when
not
here
bolt
the
west
door
at
eleven
unless
know
someone
is
out
last
night
bolted
it
at
eleven
as
usual
was
miss
gradwyn
given
set
of
keys
to
the
west
door
when
she
arrived
for
her
preliminary
visit
certainly
all
patients
are
miss
gradwyn
took
her
keys
with
her
when
she
left
it
does
happen
she
returned
them
with
within
two
days
and
on
this
visit
she
arrived
on
thursday
after
dark
and
said
she
had
no
wish
to
go
into
the
garden
in
the
normal
course
of
events
she
would
have
been
given
the
keys
this
morning
and
you
keep
check
on
them
reasonable
check
there
are
six
suites
for
patients
and
six
keys
with
two
can
for
every
set
patients
particularly
long
stay
patients
have
freedom
to
come
and
go
not
running
hospital
the
west
door
is
the
one
they
use
and
of
course
all
members
of
the
household
have
keys
to
the
front
and
west
doors
these
are
all
for
as
are
the
patients
keys
they
re
in
the
key
cupboard
the
keys
were
in
small
mahogany
cupboard
fitted
to
the
wall
beside
the
fireplace
dalgliesh
checked
that
all
six
were
there
with
two
chandler
powell
didn
question
what
possible
reason
rhoda
gradwyn
could
have
had
for
an
when
nor
the
many
to
any
theory
based
on
this
unlikely
and
nor
did
dalgliesh
the
matter
but
it
had
been
important
to
ask
the
question
chandler
powell
said
from
what
dr
glenister
said
at
the
scene
and
what
myself
no
doubt
you
will
be
interested
in
the
surgical
gloves
we
keep
here
the
ones
for
use
while
operating
are
kept
in
the
surgical
room
in
the
operating
suite
which
is
kept
locked
gloves
are
also
used
by
nursing
and
household
staff
when
necessary
and
this
supply
is
in
the
cupboard
on
the
ground
floor
next
to
the
kitchen
the
gloves
are
bought
by
the
box
and
one
box
is
open
but
none
of
the
gloves
either
there
or
in
the
operating
suite
are
checked
they
re
used
as
necessary
and
thrown
away
kate
thought
so
anyone
at
the
manor
would
know
that
there
were
gloves
in
the
cupboard
but
no
would
unless
told
in
advance
there
was
no
evidence
at
present
that
surgical
gloves
had
been
used
but
they
would
be
the
obvious
choice
for
anyone
in
the
know
chandler
powell
began
folding
the
and
the
plan
of
the
manor
he
said
have
miss
gradwyn
personal
file
here
there
is
information
which
you
may
need
and
which
ve
already
given
to
chief
inspector
the
name
and
address
of
her
mother
whom
she
gave
as
next
of
kin
and
of
her
solicitor
and
there
one
other
patient
who
spent
the
night
here
who
think
may
be
helpful
mrs
skeffington
at
her
request
fitted
her
in
for
minor
today
although
running
down
the
clinic
for
the
long
christmas
break
she
was
in
the
room
next
to
miss
gradwyn
and
she
saw
lights
in
the
grounds
during
the
night
not
she
anxious
to
leave
so
it
would
be
helpful
if
you
or
one
of
your
team
could
see
her
first
she
has
already
returned
her
keys
dalgliesh
was
tempted
to
say
that
this
information
could
well
have
been
given
earlier
he
said
where
is
mrs
skeffington
now
in
the
library
with
mrs
frensham
thought
it
wise
not
to
leave
mrs
skeffington
alone
she
frightened
and
shocked
that
to
be
expected
obviously
she
couldn
stay
in
her
room
and
thought
you
wouldn
want
anyone
on
the
guest
landing
so
put
the
corridor
and
lift
out
of
as
soon
as
was
called
to
the
body
later
on
chief
inspector
telephoned
instructions
the
room
mrs
frensham
has
helped
mrs
skeffington
to
pack
and
she
has
her
with
her
ready
to
leave
it
can
be
too
soon
for
her
or
indeed
for
us
kate
thought
so
he
took
care
to
the
scene
of
crime
as
far
as
possible
even
before
he
rang
the
local
police
of
him
or
is
he
his
to
co
operate
either
way
it
was
sensible
to
keep
the
landing
and
lift
but
hardly
crucial
people
patients
and
staff
must
use
them
daily
if
this
is
an
inside
job
we
get
much
help
from
prints
the
group
passed
into
the
great
hall
dalgliesh
said
should
like
to
see
everyone
together
that
is
all
those
who
had
any
contact
with
miss
gradwyn
from
the
time
she
arrived
and
who
were
in
the
house
yesterday
from
four
thirty
when
she
was
taken
back
to
her
room
including
mr
mogworthy
there
will
be
individual
interviews
later
in
the
old
police
cottage
shall
try
to
people
routine
as
little
as
possible
but
some
is
inevitable
chandler
powell
said
you
ll
need
reasonably
large
room
when
mrs
skeffington
has
been
interviewed
and
has
left
the
library
will
be
free
if
that
will
be
convenient
the
library
can
also
be
made
available
to
you
and
your
officers
for
any
individual
interviews
dalgliesh
said
thank
you
that
will
be
convenient
for
both
parties
but
first
need
to
see
mrs
skeffington
as
they
left
the
office
chandler
powell
said
for
team
of
private
security
men
to
ensure
that
we
don
get
bothered
by
the
media
or
crowd
of
you
have
no
to
that
none
as
long
as
they
stay
outside
the
gate
and
don
with
my
investigation
it
will
be
for
me
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
do
chandler
powell
made
no
reply
outside
the
door
benton
joined
them
and
they
made
their
way
to
the
library
and
mrs
skeffington
passing
through
the
great
hall
kate
was
again
into
vivid
impression
of
light
space
and
colour
the
flames
of
the
wood
fire
the
which
transformed
the
of
the
winter
afternoon
the
but
clear
colour
of
the
painted
and
high
above
the
dark
of
the
roof
like
the
rest
of
the
manor
it
seemed
place
to
be
visited
in
wonder
never
actually
lived
in
she
could
never
be
happy
in
such
house
the
of
the
past
borne
burden
of
responsibility
and
thought
with
satisfaction
of
that
light
filled
furnished
flat
high
above
the
the
door
to
the
library
concealed
in
the
oak
linen
fold
was
on
the
right
hand
wall
close
to
the
fireplace
kate
doubted
whether
she
would
have
noticed
it
if
it
hadn
been
opened
by
chandler
powell
in
contrast
to
the
great
hall
the
room
they
entered
struck
her
as
surprisingly
small
comfortable
and
book
lined
its
silence
as
it
did
the
shelves
of
leather
backed
books
so
closely
in
height
that
they
looked
as
if
none
of
them
had
ever
been
taken
down
as
always
she
the
room
with
quick
glance
she
had
never
forgotten
of
ad
to
detective
sergeant
when
she
had
first
entered
the
squad
we
re
here
by
consent
but
we
re
not
welcome
it
still
their
home
don
at
their
simon
as
if
you
re
them
for
car
sale
the
shelves
which
lined
all
the
walls
except
the
one
with
the
three
tall
windows
were
in
lighter
wood
than
the
hall
the
and
more
elegant
perhaps
the
library
was
later
above
the
shelves
were
ranged
by
their
eyes
into
mere
no
doubt
ad
and
benton
would
know
who
they
were
would
know
too
the
date
of
the
wood
would
feel
at
home
here
she
thrust
the
thought
out
of
her
mind
surely
by
now
she
had
of
which
she
knew
was
as
unnecessary
as
it
was
tedious
no
one
she
had
ever
worked
with
on
the
squad
had
made
her
feel
less
intelligent
than
she
knew
herself
to
be
and
after
their
case
on
island
she
thought
she
had
put
behind
her
for
ever
this
half
mrs
skeffington
was
sitting
in
high
backed
chair
before
the
fire
she
didn
rise
but
settled
herself
more
the
thin
legs
held
side
by
side
her
face
was
pale
the
skin
taut
over
high
cheekbones
the
full
mouth
glossy
with
scarlet
lipstick
kate
thought
that
if
this
was
the
result
of
mr
chandler
powell
he
had
served
her
well
but
her
neck
darker
and
with
the
of
age
and
the
hands
with
their
purple
were
not
those
of
young
woman
the
hair
glossy
black
rose
from
at
the
forehead
and
fell
in
straight
waves
to
her
shoulders
her
hands
were
busy
with
it
it
and
pushing
it
back
behind
her
ears
mrs
frensham
who
had
been
sitting
opposite
got
up
and
stood
hands
folded
while
chandler
powell
made
the
kate
watched
with
amusement
the
expected
reaction
as
mrs
skeffington
eyes
fixed
on
benton
into
fleeting
but
intense
look
of
surprise
interest
and
but
it
was
to
chandler
powell
that
she
spoke
her
voice
as
as
child
thought
you
never
arrive
ve
been
sitting
here
for
hours
waiting
for
someone
to
come
but
you
weren
left
alone
at
any
time
were
you
arranged
that
you
shouldn
be
it
was
as
bad
as
being
alone
just
the
one
person
sister
who
didn
stay
for
long
wouldn
talk
about
what
happened
suppose
she
was
told
not
to
nor
did
miss
cressett
when
she
took
over
and
now
mrs
frensham
is
saying
nothing
it
like
being
in
or
under
the
rolls
is
outside
saw
it
arrive
from
the
window
our
will
need
to
get
back
and
can
stay
here
it
nothing
to
do
with
me
want
to
go
home
then
herself
with
surprising
she
turned
to
dalgliesh
and
held
out
her
hand
so
glad
you
ve
come
commander
stuart
said
that
you
would
he
told
me
not
to
worry
he
get
the
best
there
was
silence
mrs
skeffington
looked
momentarily
and
turned
her
eyes
to
george
chandler
powell
so
that
why
we
re
here
thought
kate
why
the
request
for
the
squad
had
come
from
number
ten
without
turning
her
head
she
couldn
resist
glance
at
dalgliesh
no
one
was
better
than
her
chief
in
anger
but
it
was
there
for
her
to
read
in
the
momentary
flush
across
the
forehead
the
of
his
eyes
the
face
briefly
into
mask
the
almost
of
the
muscles
she
told
herself
that
emma
had
never
seen
that
look
there
were
still
of
dalgliesh
life
which
she
kate
shared
which
were
closed
to
the
woman
he
loved
and
always
would
be
emma
knew
the
poet
and
the
lover
but
not
the
detective
not
the
police
officer
his
job
and
hers
were
to
anyone
who
had
not
taken
the
been
with
their
dangerous
authority
it
was
she
who
was
the
not
the
woman
who
had
his
heart
you
couldn
understand
the
job
of
if
you
hadn
done
it
she
had
taught
herself
not
to
feel
to
try
to
in
his
triumph
but
she
couldn
help
relishing
from
time
to
time
this
small
mrs
frensham
murmured
goodbye
and
left
and
dalgliesh
seated
himself
in
the
chair
she
had
he
said

skeffington

my
husband
sent
him
back
as
soon
as
phoned
and
that
was
when
as
soon
as
they
told
me
that
patient
was
dead
suppose
it
was
about
eight
clock
there
was
great
deal
of
coming
and
going
footsteps
and
voices
so
put
my
head
out
of
the
door
and
mr
chandler
powell
came
in
and
told
me
what
had
happened
did
you
know
rhoda
gradwyn
was
patient
in
the
room
next
door
no
didn
didn
know
she
was
here
at
all
didn
see
her
after
arrived
and
no
one
told
me
she
was
here
did
you
ever
meet
her
before
you
came
no
of
course
didn
mean
why
would
meet
her
isn
she
journalist
or
something
stuart
says
to
keep
away
from
people
like
that
you
tell
them
things
and
they
always
you
mean
it
not
as
if
we
re
in
the
same
social
circle
but
you
knew
that
someone
was
in
the
room
next
to
you
well
knew
that
kimberley
had
been
in
with
some
supper
heard
the
of
course
hadn
had
anything
to
eat
since
light
lunch
at
home
couldn
because
of
the
anaesthetic
next
day
only
now
of
course
it
doesn
matter
dalgliesh
said
can
we
get
back
to
the
time
of
your
arrival
when
was
that
well
it
was
about
five
clock
was
met
by
mr
westhall
sister
holland
and
miss
cressett
in
the
hall
and
had
tea
with
them
but
nothing
to
eat
it
was
too
dark
to
walk
in
the
garden
so
said
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
my
suite
had
to
be
up
fairly
early
because
the
anaesthetist
would
be
here
and
he
and
mr
chandler
powell
would
want
to
check
on
me
before
my
operation
so
went
to
my
room
and
watched
television
until
about
ten
clock
when
thought
go
to
bed
and
what
happened
in
the
night
well
took
some
time
getting
to
sleep
and
it
must
have
been
after
eleven
before
did
but
later
on
woke
needing
to
go
to
the
bathroom
what
time
was
that
looked
at
my
watch
to
check
how
long
been
sleeping
it
was
about
twenty
to
twelve
it
was
then
heard
the
lift
it
opposite
sister
suite
well
expect
you
ve
seen
it
just
heard
the
gentle
of
the
doors
and
then
sort
of
sound
as
it
went
down
before
going
back
to
bed
went
to
draw
back
the
curtains
always
sleep
with
the
window
little
open
and
thought
like
some
air
it
was
then
saw
this
light
among
the
cheverell
stones
what
kind
of
light
mrs
skeffington
small
light
moving
among
the
stones
it
could
have
been
torch
suppose
it
and
then
it
disappeared
perhaps
whoever
was
there
had
switched
it
off
or
pointed
it
down
didn
see
it
again
she
paused
dalgliesh
said
and
then
what
did
you
do
well
was
frightened
remembered
about
the
witch
who
was
burnt
there
and
how
the
stones
are
said
to
be
there
was
some
light
from
the
stars
but
it
was
very
dark
and
had
the
sense
that
there
was
someone
there
well
there
must
have
been
or
wouldn
have
seen
the
light
don
believe
in
of
course
but
it
was
horrible
really
suddenly
wanted
company
wanted
someone
to
talk
to
so
thought
of
the
patient
next
door
but
when
opened
the
door
into
the
corridor
realised
that
wasn
being
well
considerate
suppose
after
all
it
was
nearly
midnight
she
was
probably
asleep
if
woke
her
she
probably
to
sister
holland
sister
can
be
quite
if
you
do
something
she
of
kate
said
so
you
knew
it
was
woman
next
door
mrs
skeffington
looked
at
her
kate
thought
as
she
might
have
turned
her
gaze
on
it
usually
is
woman
isn
it
mean
this
is
clinic
for
surgery
anyway
didn
knock
on
the
next
door
decided
ring
kimberley
for
some
tea
and
read
or
listen
to
the
until
felt
tired
dalgliesh
asked
and
when
you
looked
out
into
the
corridor
did
you
see
anyone
or
hear
anything
no
of
course
didn
would
have
said
so
before
now
the
corridor
was
empty
and
very
quiet
really
just
the
one
low
light
outside
the
lift
dalgliesh
asked
when
exactly
did
you
open
your
door
and
look
out
can
you
remember
suppose
about
five
to
twelve
couldn
have
spent
more
than
five
minutes
at
the
window
so
rang
for
tea
and
kimberley
brought
it
up
did
you
tell
her
about
the
light
yes
did
said
