curious
in
when
strong
idea
into
two
minds
as
if
its
time
has
come
and
examined
the
ways
in
which
the
had
influenced
generations
as
had
and
in
music
and
the
major
of
the
world
on
those
who
followed
but
the
main
case
covered
was
undoubtedly
one
of
which
gradwyn
claimed
she
had
by
chance
discovered
the
case
was
because
on
the
face
of
it
the
by
young
of
obvious
had
been
unnecessary
young
female
still
at
university
had
produced
first
novel
and
for
major
prize
in
which
some
phrases
and
of
dialogue
and
powerful
were
taken
word
for
word
from
work
of
fiction
in
by
long
forgotten
woman
of
whom
dalgliesh
had
never
heard
the
case
was
not
least
because
of
the
quality
of
gradwyn
and
the
of
the
article
it
had
appeared
when
the
were
short
of
news
and
had
made
the
most
of
the
scandal
there
had
been
that
novel
should
be
removed
from
the
the
result
had
been
tragedy
three
days
after
the
article
appeared
the
girl
had
killed
herself
if
candace
westhall
had
been
with
the
dead
girl
lover
friend
teacher
here
was
motive
which
for
some
people
might
be
strong
enough
for
murder
it
was
then
that
the
telephone
rang
benton
was
speaking
and
dalgliesh
switched
his
mobile
to
so
that
kate
could
hear
carefully
his
excitement
benton
said
we
ve
the
car
sir
it
focus
that
was
quick
sergeant
afraid
sir
we
struck
lucky
the
arrived
late
on
friday
night
to
spend
weekend
with
them
he
was
away
all
yesterday
visiting
so
we
didn
see
him
until
this
morning
he
was
behind
the
car
on
his
for
some
miles
and
saw
it
draw
in
to
park
at
the
stones
this
was
at
about
eleven
thirty
five
on
friday
there
was
only
one
person
in
the
car
and
the
driver
switched
off
the
lights
when
he
parked
asked
him
why
he
noticed
the
and
he
said
it
was
because
is
number
glad
it
caught
his
interest
in
what
way
did
he
explain
the
fascination
apparently
it
term
sir
is
described
as
number
because
it
has
two
prime
and
them
and
you
get
numbers
with
two
prime
of
equal
length
are
known
as
numbers
and
are
used
in
apparently
it
also
the
sum
of
the
of
the
of
but
think
he
was
more
impressed
by
the
two
prime
he
had
no
trouble
with
it
in
his
mind
for
done
good
seems
appropriate
sir
dalgliesh
said
the
maths
means
nothing
to
me
but
we
must
hope
he
right
suppose
we
can
find
someone
to
confirm
it
don
think
we
need
bother
sir
he
just
got
first
in
at
oxford
he
said
he
can
never
get
stuck
behind
another
without
mentally
playing
about
with
the
number
and
the
car
owner
bit
surprising
on
the
face
of
it
it
the
michael
lives
in
cross
st
john
church
vicarage
gardens
it
of
the
city
could
be
reached
in
little
over
two
hours
on
the
motorway
dalgliesh
said
thank
you
sergeant
we
ll
go
on
to
cross
as
soon
as
we
ve
finished
here
the
driver
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
but
we
need
to
know
why
that
car
was
parked
by
the
stones
and
what
if
anything
he
saw
is
there
anything
else
sergeant
one
find
by
the
sir
before
they
left
it
more
odd
than
say
it
of
eight
old
all
of
foreign
views
and
all
dated
they
ve
been
cut
in
two
with
the
address
on
the
right
hand
side
missing
so
there
no
way
of
knowing
who
the
was
but
they
read
as
if
written
to
child
they
were
wrapped
tightly
in
silver
paper
inside
plastic
bag
and
buried
by
one
of
the
cheverell
stones
the
concerned
was
pretty
sharp
eyed
and
he
saw
some
evidence
that
the
grass
had
been
disturbed
although
not
recently
it
difficult
to
say
what
connection
they
could
have
with
miss
gradwyn
death
we
know
someone
was
at
the
stones
with
light
that
night
but
if
they
were
looking
for
the
cards
they
didn
find
them
have
you
asked
anyone
about
the
yes
sir
it
seemed
most
likely
that
they
belonged
to
sharon
bateman
so
asked
her
to
come
to
the
old
police
cottage
she
admitted
they
were
hers
and
said
they
been
sent
to
her
by
her
father
after
he
left
home
she
an
odd
girl
sir
when
first
laid
the
cards
out
she
went
so
white
that
dc
warren
and
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
made
her
sit
down
but
think
it
was
anger
sir
could
see
she
wanted
to
them
from
the
table
but
was
to
control
herself
after
that
she
was
perfectly
calm
she
said
they
were
the
most
things
she
had
and
that
she
had
buried
them
near
the
stone
when
she
first
came
to
the
manor
because
that
was
very
special
place
and
they
would
be
safe
there
was
worried
about
her
for
moment
sir
so
said
need
to
show
them
to
you
but
that
we
take
great
care
of
them
and
could
see
no
reason
why
she
couldn
have
them
back
not
sure
did
right
sir
it
might
have
been
better
to
wait
until
you
were
back
and
let
inspector
miskin
speak
to
her
dalgliesh
said
possibly
but
shouldn
worry
about
it
if
you
re
satisfied
that
she
happier
now
keep
careful
eye
on
her
we
ll
discuss
it
tonight
has
dr
glenister
report
on
the
arrived
not
yet
sir
she
rang
to
say
we
should
get
it
by
the
evening
unless
she
needs
report
it
unlikely
to
surprise
us
is
that
all
sergeant
yes
sir
don
think
there
anything
else
to
report
seeing
robin
boyton
in
half
an
hour
right
find
out
if
you
can
whether
he
has
any
from
miss
gradwyn
will
you
re
having
an
day
well
done
there
an
interesting
development
here
but
we
ll
discuss
that
later
ll
ring
you
from
cross
the
call
was
over
kate
said
poor
girl
if
she
speaking
the
truth
can
see
why
the
cards
are
important
to
her
but
why
cut
off
the
address
and
why
bother
to
hide
them
they
can
be
of
to
anyone
else
and
if
she
did
go
to
the
stones
on
friday
night
to
check
on
them
or
them
why
did
she
need
to
and
why
late
at
night
but
benton
said
that
the
was
it
looks
sir
as
if
the
cards
are
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
events
were
moving
fast
before
dalgliesh
could
reply
the
doorbell
rang
kate
said
that
ll
be
mr
and
went
down
to
let
him
in
there
was
clatter
of
feet
on
the
wooden
stairs
but
no
voices
came
in
first
no
curiosity
about
the
room
and
unsmiling
held
out
his
hand
he
said
hope
not
inconveniently
early
the
traffic
on
sunday
morning
is
light
he
was
younger
than
dalgliesh
had
expected
from
his
voice
on
the
telephone
probably
no
more
than
early
and
was
good
looking
tall
fair
haired
and
clear
skinned
he
brought
with
him
the
confidence
of
assured
success
which
was
so
in
contrast
to
his
trousers
checked
open
necked
shirt
and
well
worn
tweed
jacket
that
the
clothes
appropriate
for
weekend
in
the
country
had
air
of
fancy
dress
his
features
were
regular
the
mouth
well
shaped
and
firm
the
eyes
wary
face
dalgliesh
thought
to
reveal
only
appropriate
emotions
the
appropriate
one
now
was
of
regret
and
shock
but
not
expressed
and
to
dalgliesh
ears
not
without
note
of
an
city
firm
of
did
not
expect
to
lose
client
in
so
notorious
he
refused
the
chair
which
kate
had
pulled
out
from
the
desk
without
looking
at
it
but
used
it
to
hold
his
briefcase
opening
it
he
said
ve
brought
copy
of
the
will
doubt
if
there
is
anything
in
its
to
help
your
enquiry
but
it
is
of
course
right
that
you
should
have
it
dalgliesh
said
expect
my
colleague
has
introduced
herself
detective
inspector
kate
miskin
yes
we
met
at
the
door
kate
received
so
brief
that
their
fingers
barely
touched
no
one
sat
down
said
miss
gradwyn
death
will
distress
and
all
the
in
the
firm
as
explained
when
we
spoke
knew
her
as
client
not
as
friend
but
she
was
much
respected
and
will
be
missed
her
bank
and
my
firm
are
joint
of
the
will
so
we
shall
take
responsibility
eventually
for
the
funeral
dalgliesh
said
think
that
her
mother
now
mrs
brown
will
find
that
relief
ve
already
spoken
to
her
she
seemed
anxious
to
herself
as
far
as
possible
from
the
of
her
daughter
death
including
the
inquest
it
seems
not
to
have
been
close
relationship
and
there
may
be
family
matters
which
she
doesn
want
to
or
even
think
about
said
well
her
daughter
was
pretty
good
at
other
people
secrets
still
the
family
non
involvement
probably
you
better
than
being
landed
with
mother
the
tragedy
for
all
it
worth
and
demanding
progress
report
on
the
investigation
ll
probably
have
more
problems
with
her
than
you
anyway
whatever
her
relationship
with
her
daughter
she
ll
get
the
money
the
amount
will
probably
surprise
her
of
course
you
ll
have
seen
the
bank
and
the
dalgliesh
said
and
it
all
goes
to
the
mother
all
but
twenty
thousand
pounds
of
it
that
goes
to
robin
boyton
whose
relationship
with
the
is
unknown
as
far
as
concerned
remember
when
miss
gradwyn
came
to
discuss
the
will
with
me
she
showed
lack
of
interest
in
of
her
capital
people
usually
mention
charity
or
two
their
old
university
or
school
none
of
that
it
was
as
if
with
her
death
she
wanted
her
private
life
to
remain
anonymous
ll
phone
mrs
brown
on
monday
and
arrange
meeting
obviously
we
ll
help
in
any
way
we
can
no
doubt
you
ll
keep
us
in
touch
but
don
think
there
anything
more
can
tell
you
have
you
been
able
to
make
progress
with
your
investigation
dalgliesh
said
as
much
as
has
been
possible
in
the
one
day
since
her
death
shall
know
the
date
of
the
inquest
on
tuesday
at
this
stage
it
likely
to
be
we
may
send
someone
but
it
as
well
to
be
there
if
there
going
to
be
as
there
will
be
once
the
news
taking
the
will
dalgliesh
him
it
was
obvious
that
was
ready
to
go
closing
the
briefcase
he
said
forgive
me
if
leave
now
unless
there
anything
else
you
need
promised
my
wife
would
be
back
in
time
for
lunch
my
son
has
brought
some
school
friends
for
the
weekend
of
and
four
can
be
mixture
to
keep
in
hand
he
shook
hands
with
dalgliesh
and
kate
him
down
the
stairs
returning
she
said
he
hardly
be
likely
to
mention
his
son
from
comprehensive
and
then
regretted
the
comment
dalgliesh
had
responded
to
remark
with
briefly
smile
but
this
momentary
of
an
of
character
hadn
irritated
him
it
would
have
amused
but
not
irritated
benton
taking
out
the
bunch
of
keys
dalgliesh
said
and
now
for
the
drawers
but
first
feel
the
need
for
coffee
perhaps
we
should
have
offered
some
to
but
wasn
anxious
to
the
visit
mrs
brown
said
that
we
could
take
what
we
wanted
from
the
house
so
she
won
grudge
milk
and
coffee
that
if
there
is
milk
in
the
fridge
there
wasn
kate
said
it
not
surprising
sir
the
fridge
is
empty
of
milk
even
could
have
been
out
of
date
by
the
time
she
returned
she
took
the
down
one
flight
to
add
water
returning
with
which
she
to
use
as
second
mug
she
felt
moment
of
as
if
this
small
act
which
hardly
as
of
miss
gradwyn
privacy
was
an
impertinence
rhoda
gradwyn
had
been
particular
about
her
coffee
and
on
the
tray
with
the
coffee
was
tin
of
kate
still
with
an
irrational
guilt
that
they
should
be
taking
from
the
dead
switched
on
the
the
noise
was
loud
and
seemed
interminable
later
when
the
had
stopped
she
filled
the
two
mugs
and
carried
them
over
to
the
desk
waiting
for
the
coffee
to
cool
he
said
if
there
anything
else
interesting
this
is
where
we
ll
probably
find
it
and
unlocked
the
drawer
inside
there
was
nothing
but
folder
the
inside
pocket
with
papers
the
coffee
for
the
moment
forgotten
they
pushed
the
mugs
to
one
side
and
kate
pulled
in
chair
beside
dalgliesh
the
papers
were
almost
entirely
of
press
at
the
top
an
article
from
sunday
broadsheet
dated
the
heading
was
stark
killed
because
she
was
too
pretty
underneath
taking
half
the
page
was
photograph
of
young
girl
it
looked
like
school
photograph
the
fair
hair
had
been
carefully
brushed
and
tied
with
to
one
side
and
the
white
cotton
looking
pristine
clean
was
open
at
the
neck
and
worn
with
dark
blue
the
child
had
indeed
been
pretty
even
simply
posed
and
with
no
particular
skill
in
lighting
the
stark
photograph
conveyed
something
of
the
frank
confidence
the
to
life
and
the
of
childhood
as
kate
stared
at
it
the
image
seemed
to
into
dust
and
became
then
again
beneath
the
image
the
the
worst
of
or
outrage

been
content
to
let
the
story
speak
for
itself

twelve
years

to
the
murder
of

nine
year
old

in
the
face
she
hated
until
it
was
all
she
has
said

at
the
time
of
the
arrest
or

dalgliesh
turned
over
the
cutting
beneath
it
to
plain
sheet
of
paper
was
photograph
the
same
uniform
the
same
white
only
this
time
with
school
tie
the
face
turned
to
the
camera
with
look
kate
remembered
from
her
own
school
photographs
little
nervous
in
small
annual
of
passage
but
it
was
an
oddly
adult
face
and
it
was
one
they
knew
dalgliesh
took
up
his
glass
again
studied
the
picture
then
handed
the
glass
to
kate
the
distinctive
features
were
there
the
high
forehead
the
slightly
eyes
the
small
precise
mouth
with
the
full
upper
lip
an
face
which
it
was
now
impossible
to
see
as
innocent
or
the
eyes
stared
into
the
camera
as
as
the
which
formed
the
image
the
lower
lip
seeming
now
in
but
with
the
same
suggestion
of
as
kate
stared
her
mind
very
different
picture
child
face
smashed
into
blood
and
broken
bone
fair
hair
in
blood
it
hadn
been
case
for
the
met
and
with
guilty
there
had
been
no
trial
but
the
murder
old
memories
for
her
and
she
thought
for
dalgliesh
dalgliesh
said
sharon
bateman
wonder
how
gradwyn
managed
to
get
hold
of
this
it
odd
they
were
able
to
it
must
have
been
lifted
it
wasn
the
only
thing
rhoda
had
managed
to
get
hold
of
her
had
obviously
started
since
her
first
visit
to
the
manor
and
it
had
been
the
first
cutting
was
followed
by
others
neighbours
had
been
both
in
horror
and
out
information
about
the
family
there
were
pictures
of
the
small
house
in
which
the
children
had
lived
with
their
mother
and
grandmother
at
the
time
of
the
murder
the
parents
were
divorced
their
father
having
walked
out
two
years
previously
neighbours
still
living
in
the
street
reported
that
the
marriage
had
been
but
there
had
been
no
trouble
with
the
children
no
police
or
social
workers
round
or
anything
like
that
was
the
pretty
one
no
doubt
about
it
but
the
girls
had
seemed
to
get
on
all
right
shirley
was
the
quiet
one
bit
not
exactly
friendly
child
their
memories
obviously
influenced
by
the
horror
of
what
had
happened
suggested
the
child
had
always
been
the
odd
one
out
they
reported
sounds
of
shouting
and
occasional
before
the
parents
parted
but
the
children
had
always
seemed
properly
for
the
grandmother
saw
to
that
there
had
been
of
after
the
father
left
some
obviously
of
the
mother
although
this
was
reported
with
and
one
or
two
students
looking
for
cheap
accommodation
none
of
whom
stayed
long
rhoda
gradwyn
had
somehow
or
other
got
hold
of
the
report
death
had
been
by
and
the
injuries
to
the
face
which
had
destroyed
the
eyes
and
broken
the
nose
were
after
death
gradwyn
had
also
and
interviewed
one
of
the
police
officers
concerned
with
the
case
there
had
been
no
mystery
death
had
occurred
at
about
three
thirty
on
saturday
afternoon
when
the
grandmother
then
aged
sixty
nine
had
gone
to
local
hall
to
play
it
was
not
unusual
for
the
children
to
be
left
alone
the
murder
had
been
discovered
when
the
grandmother
returned
home
at
six
clock
body
was
on
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
in
which
the
family
mostly
lived
and
shirley
was
upstairs
asleep
in
her
bed
she
had
made
no
attempt
to
wash
her
sister
blood
from
her
hands
and
arms
her
were
on
the
weapon
an
old
flat
iron
which
was
used
as
and
she
had
admitted
killing
her
sister
with
no
more
emotion
than
if
she
had
confessed
to
leaving
her
briefly
alone
kate
and
dalgliesh
sat
for
moment
in
silence
kate
knew
that
their
thoughts
ran
in
this
discovery
was
which
would
influence
both
their
of
sharon
as
suspect
how
could
it
fail
to
and
the
of
the
investigation
she
saw
it
now
as
with
both
victims
had
been
that
fact
might
prove
but
it
was
still
fact
sharon
bateman
and
they
would
continue
to
use
that
name
wouldn
be
living
in
the
community
if
the
hadn
seen
her
as
no
longer
threat
to
that
wasn
she
to
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
suspects
no
more
likely
to
be
guilty
than
any
of
the
others
and
who
else
knew
had
chandler
powell
been
told
had
sharon
confided
in
anyone
at
the
manor
and
if
so
in
whom
had
rhoda
gradwyn
suspected
sharon
from
the
first
and
was
that
why
she
had
stayed
on
had
she
threatened
exposure
and
if
so
had
sharon
or
perhaps
someone
else
who
knew
the
truth
taken
steps
to
stop
her
and
if
they
someone
else
wouldn
the
very
presence
of
murderer
at
the
manor
influence
the
service
in
deciding
whether
the
case
would
stand
up
in
court
the
thoughts
seemed
to
in
her
mind
but
she
didn
voice
them
with
dalgliesh
she
was
always
careful
not
to
state
the
obvious
now
dalgliesh
said
this
year
we
ve
had
the
of
functions
in
the
home
office
but
think
ve
got
the
changes
more
or
less
clear
in
my
mind
since
may
the
new
of
justice
became
responsible
for
the
national
management
service
and
the
officers
who
the
are
now
called
sharon
will
certainly
have
one
ll
have
to
check
that
ve
got
the
facts
right
but
my
understanding
is
that
an
has
to
spend
at
least
four
trouble
free
years
in
the
community
before
the
is
lifted
but
the
licence
remains
in
force
for
life
so
that
is
to
be
recalled
at
any
point
kate
said
but
surely
sharon
has
legal
to
her
that
she
become
involved
even
if
innocent
in
case
of
murder
certainly
she
should
have
done
but
if
she
hasn
the
national
management
service
will
learn
about
it
tomorrow
when
the
news
sharon
should
also
have
told
them
about
her
change
of
job
whether
or
not
she
has
been
in
touch
with
her
it
certainly
my
responsibility
to
the
service
and
theirs
to
provide
report
for
the
of
justice
it
the
service
not
the
police
who
must
handle
the
information
and
make
decisions
on
need
to
know
kate
said
so
we
say
and
do
nothing
until
sharon
takes
over
but
don
we
need
to
interview
her
again
this
her
status
in
the
investigation
obviously
it
important
for
the
officer
to
be
present
when
we
do
question
sharon
and
like
that
to
be
tomorrow
if
possible
sunday
isn
the
best
day
to
get
this
set
up
but
can
probably
get
in
touch
with
the
officer
through
the
duty
officer
at
the
of
justice
ll
phone
benton
need
to
have
sharon
watched
but
it
has
to
be
done
with
complete
while
get
this
set
up
could
you
continue
looking
through
the
files
here
ll
phone
from
the
dining
room
downstairs
it
may
take
some
time
left
alone
kate
settled
again
to
the
files
she
knew
that
dalgliesh
had
left
her
so
that
she
could
be
and
it
would
indeed
have
been
difficult
to
sort
through
the
remaining
boxes
without
listening
to
what
he
was
saying
half
an
hour
later
she
heard
dalgliesh
foot
on
the
stairs
coming
in
he
said
that
was
rather
quicker
than
feared
there
were
the
general
to
be
jumped
through
but
got
the
officer
in
the
end
mrs
she
lives
in
london
and
caught
her
just
as
she
was
leaving
for
family
lunch
she
ll
come
to
wareham
tomorrow
by
an
early
train
and
ll
arrange
for
benton
to
meet
her
and
bring
her
straight
to
the
old
police
cottage
if
possible
want
her
visit
to
be
she
seems
convinced
that
sharon
needs
no
particular
and
isn
danger
but
the
sooner
she
leaves
the
manor
the
better
kate
asked
are
you
thinking
of
going
back
to
dorset
now
sir
no
there
nothing
to
be
done
about
sharon
until
mrs
tomorrow
we
ll
go
on
to
and
clear
up
the
matter
of
the
car
we
ll
take
the
copy
of
the
will
the
file
about
sharon
and
the
article
on
but
think
that
all
unless
you
ve
found
anything
else
relevant
kate
said
nothing
that
new
to
us
sir
there
an
article
about
the
huge
suffered
by
the
lloyd
names
in
the
early
miss
cressett
told
us
that
sir
was
among
them
and
was
forced
to
sell
cheverell
manor
the
best
pictures
were
apparently
sold
there
picture
of
the
manor
and
one
of
sir
the
article
isn
particularly
kind
to
the
names
but
can
see
it
as
possible
motive
for
murder
we
know
that
helena
cressett
wasn
especially
anxious
to
have
miss
gradwyn
under
her
roof
shall
put
this
article
with
the
rest
of
the
papers
yes
think
we
should
have
anything
she
wrote
which
to
the
manor
but
agree
the
article
on
the
names
is
hardly
motive
for
anything
more
dangerous
than
cool
reception
when
miss
gradwyn
arrived
ve
been
looking
through
the
box
of
with
her
agent
it
seems
she
was
thinking
of
cutting
down
on
the
and
writing
it
might
be
helpful
to
see
her
agent
but
that
can
wait
anyway
add
any
relevant
letters
will
you
kate
and
we
ll
need
to
write
list
for
of
what
we
ve
taken
but
that
can
be
done
later
he
took
large
bag
from
his
case
and
got
the
papers
together
while
kate
went
to
the
kitchen
and
washed
up
the
mug
and
quickly
checking
that
anything
she
had
disturbed
was
now
back
in
its
place
dalgliesh
she
sensed
that
he
had
liked
the
house
that
he
had
been
tempted
to
the
that
it
was
in
this
that
he
too
could
happily
live
and
work
but
it
was
with
relief
that
she
stood
again
in
and
watched
in
silence
as
he
closed
and
double
locked
the
door
benton
thought
it
unlikely
that
robin
boyton
would
be
an
early
and
it
was
after
ten
before
he
and
dc
warren
set
off
to
walk
to
rose
cottage
the
cottage
like
the
one
occupied
by
the
westhalls
was
stone
under
roof
there
was
garage
to
the
left
with
standing
for
car
and
in
front
small
garden
mostly
of
low
cut
by
narrow
strip
of
the
porch
was
covered
with
strong
and
few
tight
and
and
single
pink
rose
in
full
explained
the
name
of
the
cottage
dc
warren
pressed
the
brightly
polished
bell
to
the
right
of
the
door
but
it
was
full
minute
before
benton
detected
followed
by
the
of
bolts
being
drawn
and
the
of
the
raised
the
door
was
opened
wide
and
robin
boyton
stood
before
them
and
seeming
deliberately
to
their
entrance
there
was
moment
of
silence
before
he
stood
aside
and
said
you
better
come
in
in
the
kitchen
they
entered
small
square
hall
except
for
an
oak
next
to
uncarpeted
wooden
stairs
the
door
to
the
left
was
open
and
the
glimpse
of
easy
chairs
sofa
polished
table
and
what
looked
like
of
on
the
far
wall
suggested
that
this
was
the
sitting
room
they
followed
boyton
through
the
open
door
to
the
right
the
room
stretched
the
length
of
the
cottage
and
was
full
of
light
at
the
garden
end
was
the
kitchen
with
double
sink
green
central
working
surface
and
dining
area
with
an
oak
rectangular
table
and
six
chairs
against
the
wall
facing
the
door
large
with
cupboards
held
of
mugs
and
plates
while
the
space
under
the
front
window
had
been
furnished
with
coffee
table
and
four
low
chairs
all
old
and
none
matching
taking
control
benton
introduced
dc
warren
and
himself
then
moved
towards
the
table
he
said
shall
we
sit
here
and
seated
himself
with
his
back
to
the
garden
he
said
perhaps
you
would
sit
opposite
mr
boyton
leaving
boyton
no
choice
but
to
take
the
facing
chair
with
the
light
from
the
windows
full
on
his
face
he
was
still
under
some
strong
emotion
whether
grief
fear
or
perhaps
mixture
of
both
and
looked
as
if
he
hadn
slept
his
skin
was
the
forehead
with
sweat
and
the
blue
eyes
but
he
had
recently
and
benton
detected
confusion
of
soap
and
when
boyton
spoke
trace
of
alcohol
on
his
breath
he
had
managed
in
the
short
time
since
his
arrival
to
make
the
room
look
untidy
and
dirty
the
board
was
piled
with
food
plates
and
smeared
glasses
and
the
sink
held
couple
of
while
his
long
black
coat
hanging
over
the
back
of
chair
pair
of
trainers
near
the
window
and
open
newspapers
strewn
on
the
coffee
table
completed
the
air
of
general
room
temporarily
occupied
but
without
pleasure
looking
at
boyton
benton
thought
that
his
was
face
that
would
always
be
the
strong
waves
of
yellow
hair
falling
without
over
the
forehead
the
eyes
the
strong
perfect
curve
of
the
lips
but
it
wasn
beauty
which
could
tiredness
or
fear
already
there
were
signs
of
in
of
the
under
the
eyes
of
the
muscles
round
the
mouth
but
if
he
had
himself
for
the
ordeal
when
he
spoke
it
was
without
now
turning
he
towards
the
and
said
coffee
tea
haven
had
breakfast
in
fact
can
remember
when
last
ate
but
mustn
waste
police
time
or
would
mug
of
coffee
as
and
benton
said
are
you
saying
you
aren
fit
to
be
questioned
as
fit
as
likely
to
be
given
the
circumstances
expect
you
take
murder
in
your
sergeant
it
was
sergeant
wasn
it
detective
sergeant
benton
smith
and
detective
warren
the
rest
of
us
find
murder
especially
when
the
victim
is
friend
but
of
course
you
re
only
doing
your
job
an
excuse
these
days
for
practically
anything
expect
you
want
to
take
down
my
that
sounds
my
full
name
and
address
if
the
westhalls
haven
already
provided
it
had
flat
but
had
to
give
it
up
little
difficulty
with
the
landlord
about
the
rent
so
with
my
business
partner
in
his
house
in
he
gave
his
address
and
watched
while
warren
wrote
it
down
his
huge
hand
moving
with
over
the
notebook
benton
asked
and
what
job
do
you
do
mr
boyton
you
can
put
me
down
as
an
have
an
card
and
from
time
to
time
given
the
opportunity
act
also
what
you
might
call
an
get
ideas
some
of
them
work
and
some
of
them
don
when
not
acting
and
have
no
bright
ideas
get
help
from
my
friends
and
if
that
look
to
government
for
what
is
called
the
job
benton
asked
what
are
you
doing
here
what
do
you
mean
ve
the
cottage
ve
paid
for
it
on
holiday
that
what
doing
here
but
why
at
this
time
december
can
be
the
most
propitious
month
for
holiday
the
blue
eyes
fixed
on
benton
could
ask
you
what
you
re
doing
here
look
more
at
home
than
you
do
sergeant
the
voice
so
very
english
the
face
so
very
well
still
it
must
have
helped
you
to
get
taken
on
it
can
be
easy
the
job
you
ve
chosen
not
easy
for
your
colleagues
mean
one
or
word
about
your
colour
and
they
find
themselves
or
up
before
one
of
those
hardly
part
of
the
police
are
you
not
one
of
the
boys
can
be
easy
to
cope
with
warren
looked
up
and
gave
an
almost
shake
of
the
head
as
if
one
more
example
of
the
of
people
in
hole
to
go
on
then
returned
to
his
notebook
his
hand
again
moving
slowly
across
the
page
benton
said
calmly
will
you
answer
my
question
please
ll
put
it
differently
why
are
you
here
at
this
particular
time
because
miss
gradwyn
asked
me
to
come
she
booked
in
for
an
operation
which
would
be
life
changing
for
her
and
she
wanted
to
have
friend
here
to
join
her
for
her
week
convalescence
come
to
this
cottage
fairly
regularly
as
no
doubt
my
cousins
have
told
you
it
was
probably
because
the
assistant
surgeon
marcus
is
my
cousin
and
the
manor
that
rhoda
came
here
anyway
she
said
she
needed
me
so
came
does
that
answer
your
question
not
entirely
mr
boyton
if
she
was
so
anxious
to
have
you
here
why
did
she
make
it
plain
to
mr
chandler
powell
that
she
didn
want
any
visitors
that
what
he
says
are
you
him
of
lying
don
put
words
into
my
mouth
sergeant
she
may
have
changed
her
mind
although
don
think
it
likely
she
may
not
have
wanted
me
to
see
her
until
the
were
off
and
the
scar
or
the
great
george
might
have
thought
it
unwise
for
her
to
have
visitors
and
put
stop
to
it
how
should
know
what
happened
only
know
she
asked
me
to
come
and
was
going
to
stay
here
until
she
left
but
you
sent
her
text
message
didn
you
we
found
it
on
her
mobile
something
very
important
has
cropped
up
need
to
consult
you
please
see
me
please
don
shut
me
out
what
was
this
very
important
matter
there
was
no
reply
boyton
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
the
gesture
might
benton
thought
be
an
attempt
to
wave
of
emotion
but
it
was
also
convenient
way
of
his
thoughts
after
few
moments
silence
benton
said
and
did
you
see
her
to
discuss
this
important
matter
at
any
time
after
she
arrived
here
boyton
spoke
through
his
hands
how
could
you
know
didn
they
wouldn
let
me
into
the
manor
before
or
after
the
operation
and
by
saturday
morning
she
was
dead
have
to
ask
you
again
mr
boyton
what
was
this
important
matter
and
now
boyton
was
looking
at
benton
his
voice
controlled
it
wasn
really
important
tried
to
make
it
sound
as
if
it
was
it
was
about
money
my
partner
and
need
another
house
for
our
business
and
suitable
one
has
come
on
the
market
it
would
be
really
good
for
rhoda
and
hoped
she
help
with
the
scar
gone
and
new
life
before
her
she
might
have
been
interested
and
suppose
your
partner
can
confirm
this
about
the
house
yes
he
could
but
don
see
why
you
should
ask
him
didn
tell
him
was
going
to
approach
rhoda
none
of
this
is
your
business
benton
said
we
re
investigating
murder
mr
boyton
everything
is
our
business
and
if
you
for
miss
gradwyn
and
want
to
see
her
killer
caught
you
can
help
best
by
answering
our
questions
fully
and
no
doubt
you
ll
be
anxious
now
to
get
back
to
london
and
your
no
booked
for
week
and
staying
for
week
that
what
said
do
and
it
to
rhoda
want
to
find
out
what
going
on
here
the
answer
surprised
benton
most
suspects
unless
they
enjoy
involvement
with
violent
death
are
anxious
to
put
as
much
distance
between
themselves
and
the
crime
as
possible
it
was
convenient
to
have
boyton
here
in
the
cottage
but
he
had
expected
his
suspect
to
protest
that
they
couldn
hold
him
and
that
he
needed
to
get
back
to
london
he
asked
how
long
have
you
known
rhoda
gradwyn
and
how
did
you
meet
we
met
about
six
years
ago
after
not
very
successful
fringe
theatre
of
waiting
for
just
left
drama
school
we
met
at
drinks
party
afterwards
occasion
but
lucky
one
for
me
we
talked
asked
her
to
have
dinner
the
following
week
and
to
my
surprise
she
agreed
after
that
we
met
from
time
to
time
not
frequently
but
always
with
pleasure
at
least
as
far
as
concerned
ve
told
you
she
was
my
friend
dear
friend
and
one
of
those
who
helped
me
when
there
was
no
acting
job
and
had
no
ideas
not
often
and
not
much
she
always
paid
for
dinner
when
we
met
can
make
you
understand
and
don
see
why
should
try
it
not
your
business
loved
her
don
mean
was
in
love
with
her
mean
loved
her
on
seeing
her
liked
to
think
she
was
in
my
life
don
think
she
loved
me
but
she
usually
saw
me
when
asked
could
talk
to
her
it
wasn
and
it
wasn
about
sex
but
it
was
love
and
now
one
of
those
at
the
manor
has
killed
her
and
not
leaving
here
until
know
who
and
not
answering
any
more
questions
about
her
what
we
felt
we
felt
it
nothing
to
do
with
why
or
how
she
died
and
if
could
explain
you
wouldn
understand
you
only
laugh
he
was
beginning
to
cry
making
no
attempt
to
the
flow
of
tears
benton
said
why
should
we
laugh
about
love
and
thought
oh
god
it
sounds
like
some
ghastly
why
should
we
laugh
about
love
why
oh
why
should
we
laugh
about
love
he
could
almost
hear
itself
into
his
brain
it
might
do
well
at
the
song
looking
across
at
boyton
face
he
thought
the
emotion
is
real
enough
but
what
exactly
is
it
he
asked
more
gently
can
you
tell
us
what
you
did
from
the
moment
you
arrived
at
stoke
cheverell
when
was
that
boyton
managed
to
control
himself
and
more
quickly
than
benton
had
expected
looking
at
boyton
face
he
wondered
whether
this
swift
was
the
his
of
emotions
on
thursday
night
at
about
ten
clock
drove
down
from
london
so
miss
gradwyn
didn
ask
you
to
drive
her
down
no
she
didn
and
didn
expect
her
to
she
likes
driving
not
being
driven
anyway
she
needed
to
be
here
early
for
and
so
on
and
couldn
get
away
until
the
evening
brought
some
food
with
me
for
breakfast
on
friday
but
otherwise
thought
shop
for
what
needed
rang
the
manor
to
say
arrived
and
to
after
rhoda
and
was
told
she
was
sleeping
asked
when
could
see
her
and
was
told
by
sister
holland
that
she
had
specifically
asked
for
no
visitors
so
let
it
rest
did
consider
calling
in
on
my
cousins
they
re
next
door
in
stone
cottage
and
the
lights
were
on
but
didn
think
they
exactly
welcome
me
particularly
after
ten
at
night
watched
tv
for
an
hour
and
went
to
bed
on
friday
afraid
slept
in
so
it
no
good
asking
me
about
anything
before
eleven
then
phoned
the
manor
again
and
was
told
that
the
operation
had
gone
well
and
rhoda
was
they
repeated
that
she
didn
want
visitors
had
lunch
at
about
two
in
the
village
pub
and
afterwards
went
for
drive
and
did
some
shopping
then
came
back
here
and
was
in
all
evening
on
saturday
found
out
about
rhoda
murder
when
saw
the
police
cars
arriving
and
tried
to
get
into
the
manor
in
the
end
managed
to
push
past
pc
on
the
door
and
broke
into
the
little
set
up
your
boss
had
arranged
but
you
know
all
about
that
benton
asked
did
you
at
any
time
enter
the
manor
before
you
forced
your
way
in
on
saturday
afternoon
no
thought
made
that
plain
what
were
your
from
four
thirty
on
friday
afternoon
until
saturday
afternoon
when
you
learnt
about
the
murder
asking
in
particular
if
you
went
out
at
any
time
during
friday
night
it
very
important
you
might
have
seen
something
or
someone
told
you
didn
go
out
and
as
didn
go
out
saw
nothing
and
nobody
was
in
bed
by
eleven
no
cars
no
one
arriving
late
at
night
or
early
saturday
morning
arriving
where
ve
told
you
was
in
bed
by
eleven
was
drunk
if
you
must
know
suppose
if
had
crashed
through
the
front
door
might
have
heard
it
but
doubt
could
have
made
it
downstairs
but
then
there
friday
afternoon
after
you
had
drink
and
lunch
at
the
cressett
arms
didn
you
visit
cottage
near
the
with
the
main
road
the
one
set
back
from
the
road
with
long
front
garden
it
called
cottage
yes
did
there
was
no
one
there
the
cottage
was
empty
with
for
sale
board
on
the
gate
hoped
the
might
have
the
address
of
someone
knew
who
used
to
live
there
it
was
small
private
matter
want
to
send
her
christmas
card
as
simple
as
that
it
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
mog
was
cycling
past
no
doubt
to
visit
his
for
bit
of
anything
on
offer
and
suppose
he
handed
you
that
of
gossip
some
people
in
this
bloody
village
can
keep
their
mouths
shut
telling
you
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
rhoda
we
re
not
suggesting
it
had
mr
boyton
but
you
were
asked
for
an
account
of
what
you
did
since
arriving
here
why
leave
that
out
because
forgotten
it
it
wasn
important
ok
went
to
the
village
pub
for
lunch
saw
nobody
and
nothing
happened
can
remember
every
single
detail
upset
confused
if
you
re
going
to
keep
on
me
ll
have
to
send
for
lawyer
you
could
certainly
do
that
if
you
think
it
necessary
and
if
you
seriously
believe
you
re
being
no
doubt
you
ll
make
formal
complaint
we
may
wish
to
question
you
again
either
before
you
leave
or
in
london
in
the
meantime
suggest
that
if
there
any
other
fact
however
that
you
have
to
mention
you
let
us
know
as
soon
as
possible
they
rose
to
go
it
was
then
that
benton
remembered
that
he
hadn
asked
about
miss
gradwyn
will
to
have
forgotten
such
an
from
ad
would
have
been
bad
mistake
angry
with
himself
he
spoke
almost
without
thinking
you
say
you
were
miss
gradwyn
dear
friend
did
she
ever
confide
in
you
about
her
will
hint
that
you
might
be
at
your
last
meeting
perhaps
when
was
that
on
november
the
at
the
she
never
mentioned
her
will
why
should
she
wills
are
about
death
she
wasn
expecting
to
die
the
operation
wasn
life
threatening
why
would
we
talk
about
her
will
are
you
saying
you
ve
seen
it
and
now
unmistakable
under
his
tone
of
outrage
was
the
half
curiosity
and
of
hope
benton
said
casually
no
we
haven
seen
it
it
was
just
thought
boyton
didn
come
to
the
door
and
they
left
him
sitting
at
the
table
head
in
hands
closing
the
garden
gate
behind
them
they
set
out
to
return
to
the
old
police
cottage
benton
said
well
what
did
you
think
of
him
not
much
not
bright
is
he
and
with
it
but
can
see
him
as
killer
if
he
wanted
to
murder
miss
gradwyn
why
follow
her
down
here
he
have
more
opportunity
in
london
but
don
see
how
he
could
have
done
it
without
an
benton
said
perhaps
gradwyn
herself
letting
him
in
for
what
she
thought
would
be
confidential
chat
but
on
the
day
of
her
operation
unusual
surely
he
frightened
that
obvious
but
he
also
excited
and
why
is
he
staying
on
have
feeling
he
was
lying
about
the
important
matter
that
he
wanted
to
discuss
with
rhoda
gradwyn
agree
it
hard
to
see
him
as
murderer
but
then
that
goes
for
everyone
here
and
think
he
was
lying
about
the
will
they
walked
on
in
silence
benton
wondered
whether
he
had
confided
too
much
it
must
he
thought
be
difficult
for
dc
warren
part
of
the
team
and
yet
member
of
another
force
only
members
of
the
special
unit
took
part
in
the
evening
but
dc
warren
would
probably
feel
more
relieved
than
at
being
he
had
told
benton
that
by
seven
unless
specifically
needed
he
drove
back
to
wareham
to
his
wife
and
four
children
altogether
he
was
his
worth
and
benton
liked
him
and
felt
at
ease
with
the
six
foot
two
of
solid
pacing
by
his
side
benton
had
strong
interest
in
helping
to
ensure
that
warren
home
life
wasn
disturbed
his
wife
was
and
that
morning
warren
had
arrived
with
six
of
and
dalgliesh
spoke
little
on
the
journey
north
this
wasn
unusual
and
kate
didn
find
his
uncomfortable
to
journey
with
dalgliesh
in
silence
had
always
been
rare
and
private
pleasure
as
they
approached
the
of
cross
she
concentrated
on
giving
precise
instructions
well
in
advance
of
turning
and
on
contemplating
the
interview
ahead
dalgliesh
hadn
phoned
to
give
the
warning
of
their
arrival
it
was
hardly
necessary
as
could
usually
be
found
on
sunday
if
not
in
their
or
then
somewhere
in
the
parish
and
there
was
also
advantage
in
surprise
visit
the
address
they
were
seeking
was
gardens
the
fifth
turning
off
way
wide
road
running
to
the
centre
of
the
city
here
was
no
sunday
calm
the
traffic
was
heavy
cars
and
of
on
the
road
the
roar
was
constant
to
the
repeated
of
the
red
with
the
first
of
the
better
known
no
doubt
in
the
city
centre
the
was
being
by
the
official
but
in
this
less
privileged
the
individual
and
efforts
of
the
local
and
café
the
rain
and
faded
the
swinging
lights
blinking
from
red
to
green
to
yellow
and
the
occasional
decorated
christmas
tree
seemed
less
celebration
than
desperate
defence
against
despair
the
faces
of
the
seen
through
the
rain
side
windows
of
the
car
had
the
look
of
peering
through
the
of
the
rain
which
had
throughout
their
journey
they
could
have
been
driving
through
any
in
an
inner
city
not
so
much
as
an
mixture
of
the
old
and
new
the
neglected
and
the
of
small
shops
were
broken
by
series
of
high
rise
set
well
back
behind
and
short
of
well
and
obviously
eighteenth
century
houses
was
an
unexpected
and
contrast
to
the
the
shops
and
the
shop
signs
the
people
heads
against
the
driving
rain
seemed
to
move
with
no
apparent
purpose
or
stood
under
the
of
shop
the
traffic
only
the
mothers
pushing
their
baby
the
in
plastic
showed
desperate
and
energy
kate
fought
off
the
with
guilt
which
always
descended
on
her
at
the
sight
of
high
rise
in
such
to
local
authority
and
human
desperation
had
she
been
born
and
from
childhood
her
one
compulsion
had
been
to
escape
to
break
free
from
the
smell
of
on
the
stairs
lift
that
was
always
broken
down
the
graffiti
the
the
voices
and
she
had
escaped
she
told
herself
that
life
in
high
rise
was
probably
better
now
even
in
city
centre
but
she
couldn
drive
past
without
feeling
that
in
her
personal
something
that
was
part
of
her
had
not
been
so
much
rejected
as
betrayed
no
one
could
miss
st
john
church
it
stood
on
the
left
of
the
road
huge
victorian
building
with
dominant
on
the
with
gardens
kate
wondered
how
local
could
possibly
support
this
apparently
it
was
with
difficulty
tall
outside
the
gate
bore
painted
like
which
proclaimed
that
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
remained
to
be
raised
and
underneath
the
words
please
help
save
our
an
pointing
to
hundred
and
twenty
three
thousand
looked
as
if
it
had
remained
for
some
time
dalgliesh
drew
up
outside
the
church
and
went
over
quickly
to
look
at
the
notice
board
sliding
back
into
his
seat
he
said
low
mass
at
seven
high
mass
at
ten
thirty
and
at
six
five
to
seven
wednesday
and
with
luck
we
ll
find
him
at
home
kate
was
grateful
that
she
and
benton
weren
facing
this
interview
together
years
of
experience
in
of
variety
of
suspects
had
taught
her
the
accepted
and
where
necessary
in
the
face
of
she
knew
when
and
were
necessary
and
when
they
were
seen
as
she
had
learnt
never
to
raise
her
voice
or
her
gaze
but
this
suspect
if
that
what
he
proved
to
be
was
one
she
wouldn
find
it
easy
to
question
it
was
difficult
to
see
as
suspect
for
murder
but
there
might
be
an
if
less
horrific
reason
for
his
stopping
at
that
and
lonely
spot
so
late
at
night
and
what
exactly
was
one
supposed
to
call
him
was
he
vicar
or
priest
should
she
call
him
father
she
had
heard
all
used
at
different
times
but
the
and
indeed
the
belief
of
the
national
religion
were
alien
to
her
the
morning
assembly
at
her
inner
city
comprehensive
had
been
faith
with
occasional
to
what
little
she
knew
about
the
country
established
church
had
been
learnt
from
and
and
from
the
pictures
in
the
major
she
knew
herself
to
be
intelligent
with
an
interest
in
life
and
people
but
the
job
she
loved
had
largely
satisfied
her
curiosity
her
personal
of
honesty
kindness
courage
and
truth
in
human
had
no
and
no
need
of
one
the
grandmother
who
had
brought
her
up
had
given
her
only
one
piece
of
advice
on
religion
which
even
at
the
age
of
eight
she
had
found
she
had
asked
gran
do
you
believe
in
god
what
question
you
don
want
to
start
wondering
about
god
at
your
age
only
one
thing
to
remember
about
god
when
you
re
dying
call
in
priest
he
ll
see
you
re
all
right
but
suppose
don
know
dying
usually
do
time
enough
then
to
start
bothering
your
head
with
god
well
at
this
moment
she
didn
need
to
bother
her
head
ad
was
the
son
of
priest
and
had
interviewed
before
who
better
to
cope
with
the
michael
they
turned
into
gardens
if
there
had
ever
been
gardens
all
that
remained
now
were
occasional
trees
many
of
the
original
victorian
houses
still
stood
but
number
two
and
four
or
five
houses
beyond
were
square
modern
red
brick
number
two
was
the
largest
with
garage
to
the
left
and
small
front
lawn
with
central
bed
the
garage
door
was
open
and
inside
was
dark
blue
focus
with
the
kate
rang
the
bell
before
there
was
any
response
she
caught
the
sound
of
woman
voice
calling
and
the
high
shout
of
child
after
some
delay
there
was
the
sound
of
keys
being
turned
and
the
door
opened
they
saw
young
woman
pretty
and
very
fair
she
was
wearing
trousers
with
and
was
carrying
child
on
her
right
while
two
obviously
twins
pulled
at
both
sides
of
her
trousers
they
were
of
their
mother
each
with
the
same
round
face
coloured
hair
cut
in
fringe
and
wide
eyes
which
now
stared
at
the
in
judgement
dalgliesh
took
out
his
card
mrs
commander
dalgliesh
from
the
police
and
this
is
detective
inspector
miskin
we
re
here
to
see
your
husband
she
looked
surprised
the
police
that
something
new
we
do
get
the
local
police
round
from
time
to
time
some
of
the
from
the
high
cause
trouble
occasionally
they
re
good
crowd
the
local
police
mean
anyway
please
come
in
sorry
kept
you
waiting
but
we
ve
got
these
double
security
locks
it
awful
know
but
michael
has
been
attacked
twice
in
the
last
year
that
why
we
had
to
take
down
the
sign
saying
that
this
is
the
vicarage
she
called
in
voice
totally
of
anxiety
michael
darling
someone
from
the
met
police
is
here
the
michael
was
wearing
with
what
looked
like
an
old
college
scarf
wound
round
his
neck
kate
was
glad
when
mrs
shut
the
front
door
behind
them
the
house
struck
her
as
cold
he
came
forward
and
rather
absent
mindedly
shook
hands
he
was
older
than
his
wife
but
perhaps
not
so
much
older
as
he
seemed
his
thin
rather
frame
in
contrast
to
her
his
brown
hair
cut
in
like
fringe
was
beginning
to
grey
but
the
kindly
eyes
were
watchful
and
and
when
he
kate
hand
his
grip
was
confident
on
his
wife
and
children
look
of
puzzled
love
he
indicated
door
behind
him
perhaps
in
the
study
it
was
larger
room
than
kate
had
expected
its
windows
looking
out
on
small
garden
obviously
no
attempt
at
the
beds
or
the
lawn
had
been
made
the
small
space
had
been
given
over
to
the
children
with
frame
and
swing
various
were
strewn
across
the
grass
the
study
itself
smelled
of
books
and
she
thought
of
there
was
crowded
desk
table
piled
with
books
and
magazines
set
against
the
wall
modern
gas
fire
at
present
lit
with
only
one
bar
and
to
the
right
of
the
desk
with
for
before
it
there
were
two
rather
battered
armchairs
in
front
of
the
fire
mr
said
think
you
ll
find
these
two
chairs
reasonably
comfortable
himself
at
the
desk
he
edged
round
the
swivel
chair
to
face
them
hands
on
knees
he
looked
little
puzzled
but
completely
dalgliesh
said
we
wanted
to
ask
you
about
your
car
my
old
don
think
it
can
have
been
taken
and
used
in
the
of
crime
it
very
for
its
age
but
it
doesn
go
very
fast
can
believe
anyone
has
taken
it
with
evil
as
you
probably
saw
it
in
the
garage
it
perfectly
all
right
dalgliesh
said
it
was
seen
parked
late
on
friday
night
close
to
the
scene
of
serious
crime
hoping
that
whoever
was
driving
might
have
seen
something
that
would
help
our
enquiries
perhaps
another
parked
car
or
someone
acting
were
you
in
dorset
on
friday
night
father
dorset
no
was
here
with
the
church
council
on
friday
from
five
clock
as
it
happens
wasn
driving
the
car
myself
that
evening
it
to
friend
he
taken
his
in
for
and
its
but
gather
there
were
things
that
needed
to
be
done
he
had
an
urgent
appointment
he
was
very
anxious
to
keep
so
he
asked
if
he
could
mine
said
could
use
my
wife
bike
if
were
called
out
sure
he
ll
be
happy
to
help
in
any
way
he
can
when
did
he
return
the
car
it
must
have
been
very
early
yesterday
morning
before
we
got
up
remember
that
it
was
back
when
went
out
to
seven
clock
mass
he
left
thank
you
note
on
the
and
he
filled
it
with
thought
he
would
he
always
considerate
dorset
you
say
that
was
long
journey
think
if
he
seen
anything
suspicious
or
had
an
incident
he
would
have
phoned
and
told
me
actually
we
haven
spoken
since
he
returned
dalgliesh
said
anyone
near
the
scene
could
have
useful
information
without
its
it
might
not
have
seemed
unusual
or
suspicious
at
the
time
may
we
have
his
name
and
address
if
he
lives
it
would
save
time
if
we
could
see
him
now
he
the
head
of
our
local
comprehensive
cross
school
you
might
catch
him
now
at
the
school
he
usually
goes
in
on
sunday
to
in
peace
for
the
week
ahead
ll
write
the
address
down
for
you
it
quite
close
you
could
walk
there
if
you
want
to
leave
your
car
here
it
should
be
safe
in
our
drive
round
he
pulled
open
the
left
hand
drawer
and
after
rummaging
for
time
found
sheet
of
paper
and
began
writing
folding
it
neatly
and
handing
it
to
dalgliesh
he
said
our
local
well
he
become
something
of
national
now
perhaps
you
read
something
in
the
papers
or
saw
that
television
programme
on
education
in
which
he
appeared
he
man
he
completely
turned
round
cross
comprehensive
it
was
all
done
by
which
suppose
most
people
would
support
but
which
others
don
seem
to
be
able
to
put
into
effect
he
that
every
child
has
talent
skill
or
which
can
his
whole
life
and
that
it
the
job
of
the
school
to
discover
and
it
of
course
he
needs
help
and
he
got
the
whole
community
involved
particularly
the
parents
school
so
do
what
can
give
here
to
two
boys
and
two
girls
once
fortnight
helped
by
the
wife
who
my
isn
on
the
they
come
because
they
want
to
learn
the
language
and
they
re
to
teach
and
one
of
our
the
chess
club
with
his
wife
they
have
boys
in
that
club
who
have
rare
talent
for
the
game
and
huge
enthusiasm
boys
who
no
one
thought
would
ever
achieve
anything
and
if
you
become
school
with
hope
of
playing
for
the
county
you
don
have
to
respect
by
carrying
knife
forgive
me
for
on
like
this
but
since
ve
known
and
become
school
ve
got
very
interested
in
education
and
it
when
good
things
happen
against
the
odds
if
you
have
time
to
talk
to
about
the
school
think
you
ll
be
fascinated
by
his
ideas
now
they
were
rising
together
he
said
oh
dear
afraid
ve
been
very
won
you
stay
for
tea
or
perhaps
coffee
he
looked
round
vaguely
as
if
expecting
the
to
from
the
air
my
wife
could
he
made
for
the
door
and
was
about
to
call
dalgliesh
said
thank
you
father
but
we
must
be
