or
claimed
to
be
and
found
work
occasionally
in
between
he
did
odd
jobs
to
bring
in
some
income
at
one
time
believe
double
by
telephone
nothing
lasted
my
aunt
who
worked
as
secretary
was
the
main
somehow
the
marriage
lasted
largely
because
he
on
her
maybe
she
loved
him
anyway
according
to
robin
she
died
of
when
he
was
seven
and
keith
found
himself
another
woman
and
to
no
one
has
heard
from
him
since
dalgliesh
asked
when
did
robin
boyton
make
regular
contact
with
you
when
marcus
took
the
job
here
with
chandler
powell
and
when
we
moved
father
into
stone
cottage
he
started
having
brief
holidays
here
in
the
guest
cottage
obviously
hoping
that
he
could
some
interest
in
marcus
or
myself
frankly
it
wasn
there
but
did
have
slight
about
him
still
have
from
time
to
time
help
him
out
with
small
two
fifty
here
five
hundred
there
when
he
asked
desperation
but
then
decided
that
this
was
unwise
it
seemed
too
like
responsibility
which
frankly
didn
accept
and
then
about
month
ago
he
got
an
extraordinary
idea
into
his
head
my
father
death
followed
my
grandfather
by
only
thirty
five
days
if
it
had
been
less
than
twenty
eight
days
there
would
have
been
difficulty
about
the
will
which
has
that
must
the
by
twenty
eight
days
to
obviously
if
my
father
hadn
from
our
grandfather
will
there
would
have
been
no
fortune
to
pass
down
to
us
robin
copy
of
grandfather
will
and
the
bizarre
idea
that
our
father
had
died
some
time
before
the
twenty
eight
days
were
up
and
that
marcus
and
together
or
one
or
other
of
us
had
concealed
his
body
in
the
freezer
in
stone
cottage
him
out
after
couple
of
weeks
or
so
and
then
called
in
old
dr
to
write
the
death
the
freezer
finally
broke
down
last
summer
but
at
that
time
although
seldom
used
it
was
working
dalgliesh
said
when
did
he
first
put
forward
this
idea
to
you
during
the
three
days
when
rhoda
gradwyn
was
here
for
her
preliminary
visit
he
arrived
the
morning
after
she
did
and
think
had
some
idea
of
seeing
her
but
she
was
that
she
didn
want
visitors
and
as
far
as
know
he
was
never
admitted
to
the
manor
she
may
have
been
behind
the
whole
idea
ve
no
doubt
the
two
were
in
in
fact
he
more
or
less
admitted
it
why
otherwise
did
gradwyn
choose
the
manor
and
why
was
it
so
important
for
robin
to
be
here
with
her
the
may
have
been
on
her
part
she
could
hardly
have
taken
it
seriously
but
with
him
it
was
serious
how
did
he
raise
the
matter
with
you
by
giving
me
an
old
death
it
detective
story
in
which
the
time
of
death
is
he
brought
it
in
to
me
as
soon
as
he
arrived
saying
he
thought
would
find
it
interesting
actually
read
it
many
years
ago
and
as
far
as
know
it
now
out
of
simply
told
robin
that
wasn
interested
in
reading
it
again
and
handed
it
back
knew
then
what
he
was
up
to
dalgliesh
said
but
surely
the
idea
was
appropriate
to
an
novel
but
not
to
the
situation
here
can
he
possibly
have
believed
there
was
truth
in
it
oh
he
believed
all
right
in
fact
there
were
number
of
circumstances
which
could
be
said
to
add
to
the
fantasy
the
idea
wasn
as
ridiculous
as
it
sounds
don
think
we
could
have
kept
the
going
for
long
but
for
few
days
or
week
maybe
two
it
would
have
been
perfectly
possible
my
father
was
an
extremely
difficult
patient
who
hated
illness
resisted
sympathy
and
was
that
he
wanted
no
visitors
looked
after
him
with
the
help
of
retired
nurse
who
is
now
living
in
and
an
elderly
who
died
just
over
year
ago
the
day
after
robin
left
had
phone
call
from
dr
the
gp
who
looked
after
my
father
robin
had
visited
him
with
some
excuse
and
tried
to
find
out
how
long
my
father
had
been
dead
before
the
doctor
was
called
in
the
doctor
was
never
patient
man
and
in
retirement
even
less
of
than
he
was
when
in
practice
and
can
well
imagine
the
response
robin
got
for
his
impertinence
dr
said
that
he
answered
no
questions
about
patients
when
they
were
alive
nor
did
he
when
they
were
dead
imagine
robin
came
away
convinced
that
the
old
doctor
if
not
when
he
signed
the
death
had
been
either
or
was
he
probably
assumed
that
we
the
two
grace
the
elderly
nurse
who
to
and
the
who
since
died
there
was
however
one
fact
he
didn
know
on
the
night
before
he
died
my
father
asked
to
see
the
parish
priest
the
he
still
the
parish
priest
in
the
village
of
course
he
came
at
once
driven
by
his
sister
who
keeps
house
for
him
and
can
be
said
to
the
church
neither
will
have
forgotten
that
evening
father
arrived
to
give
the
last
and
no
doubt
to
soul
instead
my
father
found
the
strength
to
for
the
last
time
against
all
religious
belief
in
particular
with
to
father
own
brand
of
this
wasn
information
that
robin
could
pick
up
in
the
bar
of
the
cressett
arms
doubt
whether
father
or
have
ever
spoken
of
it
except
to
marcus
and
myself
it
had
been
an
unpleasant
and
experience
happily
both
are
still
alive
but
have
second
witness
paid
short
visit
to
toronto
ten
days
ago
to
see
grace
she
was
one
of
the
very
few
people
my
father
would
but
was
left
nothing
in
his
will
and
now
that
probate
has
been
granted
wanted
to
give
her
sum
to
for
that
last
terrible
year
she
gave
me
letter
which
have
passed
to
my
solicitor
that
she
was
with
my
father
on
the
day
he
died
kate
said
quietly
with
this
information
didn
you
immediately
robin
boyton
and
him
probably
should
have
done
but
it
amused
me
to
keep
quiet
and
let
him
himself
further
if
look
at
my
with
as
much
honesty
as
is
possible
when
we
are
trying
to
justify
ourselves
think
was
glad
that
he
had
revealed
something
of
his
true
nature
always
felt
some
guilt
that
his
mother
had
been
so
neglected
but
now
didn
feel
any
necessity
to
pay
him
anything
by
this
one
attempt
at
he
had
relieved
me
from
any
future
rather
looked
forward
to
my
moment
of
triumph
however
petty
and
to
his
disappointment
dalgliesh
asked
did
he
ever
demand
money
no
he
didn
get
to
that
point
if
he
had
could
have
reported
him
to
the
police
for
attempted
but
doubt
should
have
gone
down
that
road
but
he
pretty
clearly
what
he
had
in
mind
he
seemed
content
when
said
would
consult
my
brother
and
be
in
touch
made
of
course
no
admission
kate
asked
does
your
brother
know
anything
of
this
nothing
he
been
particularly
anxious
recently
about
leaving
the
job
here
and
going
to
work
in
africa
and
saw
no
reason
to
burden
him
with
what
was
essentially
nonsense
and
of
course
he
would
have
had
no
sympathy
with
my
plan
to
my
time
and
the
humiliation
for
robin
his
is
more
character
than
is
mine
think
that
robin
was
working
himself
up
to
final
possibly
suggestion
that
should
hand
over
specific
sum
in
exchange
for
his
silence
believe
that
why
he
stayed
on
here
after
rhoda
gradwyn
death
after
all
take
it
that
you
couldn
him
unless
he
was
and
most
people
would
be
only
too
glad
to
get
away
from
the
scene
of
crime
since
her
death
he
around
rose
cottage
and
the
village
obviously
and
think
frightened
but
he
needed
to
bring
the
matter
to
head
don
know
why
he
climbed
into
the
freezer
it
could
have
been
to
see
how
it
was
for
my
father
body
to
be
placed
there
he
was
after
all
taller
than
robin
even
when
shrunken
by
his
illness
robin
might
have
had
an
idea
of
me
to
the
room
and
then
slowly
opening
the
freezer
terrifying
me
into
an
admission
that
exactly
the
kind
of
dramatic
gesture
that
might
appeal
kate
said
if
he
was
frightened
could
it
be
because
he
feared
you
personally
it
might
have
occurred
to
him
that
you
could
have
killed
miss
gradwyn
because
of
her
involvement
in
the
and
that
he
too
might
be
at
risk
candace
westhall
turned
her
eyes
to
kate
and
now
the
dislike
and
contempt
were
unmistakable
don
suppose
that
even
robin
boyton
imagination
could
seriously
that
would
see
murder
as
rational
way
out
of
any
still
suppose
it
possible
and
now
if
you
haven
any
more
questions
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
manor
dalgliesh
said
only
two
did
you
put
robin
boyton
into
the
freezer
dead
or
alive
did
not
did
you
kill
robin
boyton
no
she
and
for
moment
dalgliesh
thought
she
had
something
to
add
but
she
got
up
without
speaking
and
left
without
another
word
or
glance
by
eight
clock
that
evening
dalgliesh
had
showered
changed
and
was
beginning
to
decide
on
his
supper
when
he
heard
the
car
it
came
up
the
lane
almost
silently
the
first
he
knew
of
it
was
the
of
the
windows
behind
the
drawn
curtains
opening
the
front
door
he
saw
being
driven
onto
the
opposite
verge
and
the
lights
switched
off
few
seconds
later
emma
was
the
road
towards
him
she
was
wearing
thick
and
her
head
bare
as
she
came
in
without
speaking
he
put
his
arms
round
her
but
her
body
was
she
seemed
almost
of
his
presence
and
the
cheek
which
momentarily
brushed
his
was
icy
cold
he
was
full
of
dread
something
appalling
had
happened
an
accident
even
tragedy
she
wouldn
otherwise
have
arrived
like
this
without
warning
when
he
was
on
case
emma
never
even
telephoned
not
by
his
but
her
own
never
before
had
she
on
an
investigation
to
do
so
in
person
could
only
mean
disaster
he
took
off
her
and
led
her
to
seat
by
the
fire
waiting
for
her
to
speak
as
she
sat
silently
he
went
into
the
kitchen
and
switched
on
the
under
the
of
coffee
it
was
already
hot
and
it
took
only
few
seconds
to
it
into
mug
add
the
milk
and
bring
it
to
her
taking
off
her
gloves
she
wrapped
her
fingers
round
its
warmth
she
said
sorry
didn
phone
had
to
come
had
to
see
you
darling
what
is
it
she
been
attacked
and
yesterday
evening
she
was
on
her
way
home
from
english
to
two
it
one
of
the
things
she
does
she
in
hospital
and
they
think
she
ll
recover
by
that
suppose
they
mean
she
won
die
don
see
how
she
can
recover
not
completely
she
lost
lot
of
blood
and
one
of
the
knife
it
only
just
missed
her
heart
someone
at
the
hospital
said
she
was
lucky
lucky
what
an
odd
word
to
use
he
had
nearly
asked
how
is
but
before
the
words
were
framed
he
knew
that
the
question
was
as
ridiculous
as
it
was
and
now
she
looked
at
him
full
in
the
face
for
the
first
time
her
eyes
were
full
of
pain
she
was
in
of
anger
and
grief
couldn
help
was
useless
to
her
took
her
in
my
arms
but
mine
weren
the
arms
she
wanted
there
was
only
one
thing
she
wanted
from
me
to
get
you
to
take
over
the
case
that
why
here
she
you
she
can
talk
to
you
and
she
knows
you
re
the
best
of
course
that
was
why
she
was
here
she
didn
come
for
his
comfort
or
out
of
need
to
see
him
and
share
her
grief
she
wanted
something
from
him
and
it
was
something
he
couldn
give
he
sat
down
opposite
her
and
said
gently
emma
that
isn
possible
she
put
her
coffee
mug
on
the
and
he
could
see
her
hands
were
shaking
he
wanted
to
reach
out
and
take
them
but
was
afraid
that
she
would
anything
would
be
better
than
that
she
said
thought
that
was
what
you
say
tried
to
explain
to
that
it
might
be
outside
the
rules
but
she
doesn
understand
not
fully
not
sure
do
she
knows
that
the
victim
here
the
dead
woman
is
more
important
than
that
what
your
special
squad
is
all
about
isn
it
when
people
are
important
but
is
important
to
her
to
her
and
to
is
more
awful
than
death
if
you
were
investigating
she
know
that
the
man
who
did
this
would
be
caught
he
said
emma
the
squad
isn
to
do
with
the
importance
of
the
victim
to
the
police
murder
is
murder
unique
never
put
permanently
on
one
side
the
investigation
never
as
failure
only
as
at
present
no
murder
victim
is
ever
no
suspect
however
powerful
can
buy
from
the
enquiry
but
there
are
cases
which
are
best
by
small
team
cases
where
it
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
get
quick
result
doesn
believe
in
justice
not
now
she
thinks
you
could
take
over
if
you
wanted
to
that
if
you
asked
you
would
get
your
own
way
rules
or
no
rules
it
felt
wrong
to
be
sitting
so
far
he
longed
to
take
her
in
his
arms
but
that
would
be
too
easy
comfort
almost
he
felt
an
to
her
grief
and
what
if
she
drew
away
if
she
made
it
obvious
by
of
that
he
wasn
comfort
but
to
her
what
did
he
to
her
now
death
and
hadn
his
job
been
ring
with
an
invisible
sign
keep
out
and
this
wasn
problem
that
could
be
with
and
murmured
reassurance
not
for
them
it
couldn
even
be
by
rational
discussion
but
this
was
their
only
way
hadn
he
himself
he
thought
bitterly
that
they
could
always
talk
but
not
now
not
about
everything
he
asked
who
is
the
chief
investigating
officer
have
you
spoken
to
him
he
detective
inspector
howard
ve
got
card
somewhere
he
spoken
to
of
course
and
he
saw
in
hospital
he
said
woman
needed
to
ask
some
questions
before
went
under
the
anaesthetic
suppose
in
case
she
died
she
was
too
weak
to
say
more
than
few
words
but
apparently
they
were
important
he
said
andy
howard
is
good
detective
with
sound
team
this
isn
case
which
can
be
by
anything
but
police
work
much
of
it
routine
but
they
ll
get
there
didn
find
him
sympathetic
not
really
suppose
it
was
because
he
wasn
you
and
the
woman
sergeant
almost
hit
her
she
asked
whether
had
recently
had
sex
with
man
before
she
was
emma
that
was
question
she
had
to
ask
it
could
mean
that
they
may
have
and
if
they
have
that
huge
advantage
but
can
take
over
another
officer
investigation
apart
from
the
fact
that
in
the
middle
of
one
myself
and
it
wouldn
help
the
even
if
could
at
this
stage
it
could
even
it
sorry
can
go
back
with
you
to
try
to
explain
to
she
said
oh
expect
she
ll
understand
eventually
all
she
wants
now
is
someone
she
can
trust
not
strangers
suppose
did
know
what
you
say
and
should
have
been
able
to
explain
it
to
her
myself
sorry
came
it
was
wrong
decision
she
had
got
to
her
feet
and
rising
he
came
towards
her
he
said
can
be
sorry
for
any
decision
you
make
which
you
to
me
and
now
she
was
in
his
arms
and
shaking
with
the
force
of
her
the
face
that
was
pressed
against
his
was
wet
with
tears
he
held
her
without
speaking
until
she
then
said
my
darling
must
you
go
back
tonight
it
long
drive
can
sleep
perfectly
well
in
this
chair
as
he
had
once
before
he
remembered
at
st
college
after
they
had
first
met
she
had
been
staying
next
door
but
after
the
murder
he
had
settled
himself
in
an
armchair
in
his
sitting
room
so
that
she
could
feel
safe
in
his
bed
while
she
tried
to
sleep
he
wondered
if
she
too
was
remembering
she
said
ll
drive
carefully
we
re
getting
married
in
five
months
not
going
to
risk
killing
myself
before
then
whose
is
the
he
in
london
for
week
and
he
rang
to
make
contact
he
getting
married
and
expect
he
wanted
to
tell
me
about
it
when
he
heard
about
and
that
was
driving
here
he
me
his
car
needs
hers
to
visit
and
mine
is
in
cambridge
dalgliesh
was
shaken
by
the
sudden
of
as
powerful
as
it
was
unwelcome
she
had
finished
with
before
they
had
met
he
had
proposed
and
been
rejected
that
was
all
he
knew
he
had
never
felt
threatened
by
anything
in
her
past
nor
had
she
in
his
so
why
this
sudden
response
to
what
after
all
had
been
and
gesture
he
didn
want
to
think
of
as
either
of
these
things
and
the
man
now
had
his
chair
at
some
university
safely
out
of
the
way
so
why
the
hell
couldn
he
stay
there
he
found
himself
thinking
bitterly
that
emma
might
point
out
that
she
was
comfortable
driving
after
all
it
wouldn
be
for
the
first
time
she
drove
his
himself
he
said
there
some
soup
and
some
ham
so
ll
make
us
sandwiches
stay
by
the
fire
and
ll
bring
it
in
and
even
now
in
the
of
distress
and
heavy
eyed
she
was
beautiful
that
the
thought
in
its
its
of
sex
should
come
so
quickly
to
mind
appalled
him
she
had
come
to
him
for
comfort
and
the
only
comfort
she
he
couldn
give
and
wasn
this
of
anger
and
frustration
at
his
only
the
male
arrogance
which
said
that
the
world
is
dangerous
and
place
but
now
you
have
my
love
and
can
you
wasn
his
about
his
job
less
response
to
her
own
reluctance
to
be
involved
than
wish
to
her
from
the
worst
of
violent
world
but
even
her
world
academic
and
seeming
so
had
its
the
peace
of
great
court
was
an
he
thought
we
are
violently
into
the
world
with
blood
and
pain
and
few
of
us
will
die
with
the
dignity
for
which
we
hope
and
for
which
some
whether
we
choose
to
think
of
life
as
an
happiness
broken
only
by
inevitable
grief
and
or
as
the
of
tears
with
brief
of
the
pain
will
come
except
to
those
few
whose
make
them
apparently
to
either
or
sorrow
they
ate
together
almost
in
silence
the
ham
was
and
he
heaped
it
on
the
bread
he
drank
the
soup
almost
without
it
only
vaguely
knowing
that
it
was
good
she
did
manage
to
eat
and
within
twenty
minutes
was
ready
to
leave
helping
her
on
with
the
he
said
you
will
phone
me
when
you
get
back
to
won
be
but
do
need
to
know
you
got
home
safely
and
ll
have
word
with
di
howard
she
said
ll
ring
he
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
almost
formally
and
went
across
to
see
her
into
the
car
then
stood
watching
until
it
disappeared
down
the
lane
returning
to
the
fireplace
he
stood
looking
down
at
the
flames
ought
he
to
have
insisted
on
her
staying
the
night
but
wasn
word
that
would
ever
be
used
between
them
and
stay
where
there
was
his
bedroom
but
would
she
want
to
sleep
there
by
the
complicated
emotions
and
which
kept
them
apart
when
he
was
on
case
would
she
wish
to
kate
and
benton
tomorrow
morning
if
not
tonight
but
he
was
worried
about
her
safety
she
was
good
driver
and
would
rest
if
she
became
tired
but
the
thought
of
her
in
lay
by
even
with
the
of
locked
car
gave
him
no
comfort
he
himself
there
were
things
to
do
before
he
summoned
kate
and
benton
he
must
get
in
touch
with
detective
inspector
andy
howard
and
get
the
report
howard
was
an
experienced
and
reasonable
officer
he
wouldn
see
the
call
either
as
an
unwelcome
or
worse
as
an
attempt
to
influence
then
he
must
phone
or
write
to
with
message
for
but
to
telephone
was
almost
as
inappropriate
as
to
or
some
things
had
to
be
conveyed
by
letter
and
by
words
which
cost
something
in
time
and
careful
thought
phrases
which
might
have
some
hope
of
giving
comfort
but
there
was
only
one
thing
wanted
from
him
and
that
he
couldn
give
to
phone
now
for
her
to
hear
the
bad
news
from
him
would
be
for
them
both
the
letter
had
better
wait
until
tomorrow
and
in
the
meantime
emma
would
be
back
with
it
took
some
time
to
reach
di
andy
howard
howard
said
is
doing
well
but
it
will
be
long
road
poor
girl
met
dr
at
the
hospital
and
she
told
me
you
had
an
interest
in
the
case
meant
to
get
in
touch
earlier
to
have
word
dalgliesh
said
speaking
to
me
had
to
have
low
it
still
has
won
keep
you
now
but
was
anxious
to
have
more
up
to
date
report
than
emma
could
give
me
well
there
is
good
news
if
anything
about
this
can
be
good
we
ve
got
his
with
luck
he
ll
be
on
the
can
believe
that
he
hasn
got
form
it
was
violent
attack
but
the
wasn
completed
probably
too
drunk
she
fought
back
with
extraordinary
courage
for
so
slight
woman
ll
ring
you
as
soon
as
have
anything
to
report
and
of
course
we
re
keeping
closely
in
touch
with
miss
he
most
probably
local
he
certainly
knew
where
to
drag
her
we
ve
already
started
house
to
house
the
sooner
the
better
or
no
things
going
well
with
you
sir
not
particularly
no
clear
line
at
present
he
didn
mention
the
new
death
howard
said
well
it
early
days
sir
dalgliesh
agreed
that
it
was
early
days
and
after
howard
rang
off
he
carried
the
plates
and
mugs
into
the
kitchen
washed
and
dried
them
then
rang
kate
have
you
had
meal
yes
sir
we
ve
just
finished
then
come
over
now
please
by
the
time
kate
and
benton
arrived
the
three
glasses
were
on
the
table
the
wine
but
for
dalgliesh
it
was
less
successful
at
times
almost
meeting
he
said
nothing
about
the
visit
of
emma
but
he
wondered
whether
his
were
aware
of
it
they
must
have
heard
the
passing
wisteria
house
and
been
curious
about
any
car
arriving
at
night
on
the
road
to
the
manor
but
neither
of
them
spoke
of
it
the
discussion
was
probably
because
with
boyton
death
they
were
in
danger
of
in
advance
of
the
facts
there
was
little
new
to
be
said
about
miss
gradwyn
murder
the
post
mortem
report
had
been
received
with
dr
glenister
expected
conclusion
that
the
cause
of
death
was
by
right
handed
killer
wearing
smooth
gloves
this
last
was
hardly
necessary
information
in
view
of
the
in
the
in
one
of
the
empty
suites
she
confirmed
her
final
assessment
of
the
time
of
death
miss
gradwyn
had
been
killed
between
eleven
clock
and
twelve
thirty
kate
had
had
word
with
the
and
his
sister
both
had
found
strange
her
questions
about
the
vicar
one
and
only
visit
to
professor
westhall
but
confirmed
that
they
had
indeed
visited
stone
cottage
and
that
the
priest
had
seen
the
patient
benton
had
telephoned
dr
who
confirmed
that
boyton
had
questioned
him
about
the
time
of
death
an
impertinence
to
which
he
had
given
no
response
the
date
on
the
death
had
been
as
had
his
he
had
shown
no
curiosity
about
why
the
questions
were
being
put
so
long
after
the
probably
benton
thought
because
candace
westhall
had
been
in
touch
with
him
members
of
the
security
team
had
been
co
but
not
helpful
their
had
pointed
out
that
they
were
on
strangers
particularly
members
of
the
press
arriving
at
the
manor
not
on
with
right
to
be
there
only
one
of
the
four
men
had
been
in
the
caravan
outside
the
gates
at
the
relevant
time
and
he
couldn
remember
seeing
any
member
of
the
household
leave
the
manor
the
other
three
members
of
the
team
had
concentrated
on
the
boundary
the
manor
grounds
from
the
stones
and
the
field
in
which
they
stood
in
case
this
offered
convenient
access
dalgliesh
made
no
attempt
to
press
them
they
were
after
all
responsible
to
chandler
powell
who
was
paying
them
not
to
him
for
most
of
the
evening
dalgliesh
let
kate
and
benton
take
over
the
discussion
benton
said
miss
westhall
says
she
told
no
one
about
boyton
suspicions
that
they
the
date
of
her
father
death
it
seems
unlikely
that
she
would
but
boyton
himself
may
have
confided
in
someone
either
at
the
manor
or
in
london
and
if
so
that
person
might
use
the
knowledge
to
kill
him
and
then
tell
much
the
same
story
as
miss
westhall
kate
voice
was
can
see
an
killing
boyton
or
not
at
least
not
in
this
way
think
of
the
he
have
to
arrange
with
his
victim
in
stone
cottage
when
he
could
be
sure
that
the
westhalls
weren
there
and
the
door
would
be
open
and
what
reason
could
he
give
for
boyton
into
neighbour
cottage
and
why
kill
him
here
anyway
london
would
be
and
the
same
would
to
anyone
at
the
manor
anyway
there
no
point
in
until
we
get
the
report
on
the
face
of
it
seems
more
likely
explanation
than
murder
particularly
in
view
of
the
bostocks
evidence
about
boyton
fascination
with
the
freezer
which
some
to
miss
westhall
explanation
provided
of
course
that
they
re
not
lying
benton
broke
in
but
you
were
there
ma
am
sure
they
weren
lying
don
think
kim
in
particular
has
the
to
make
up
story
like
that
and
tell
it
so
was
absolutely
convinced
so
at
the
time
was
but
we
have
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
if
this
is
murder
not
then
it
has
to
be
tied
up
with
rhoda
gradwyn
death
two
in
the
same
house
at
the
same
time
belief
benton
said
quietly
but
it
has
been
known
ma
am
kate
said
if
we
look
at
the
facts
and
motive
for
the
present
the
obvious
suspects
are
miss
westhall
and
mrs
frensham
what
were
they
really
doing
at
the
two
cottages
opening
cupboards
and
then
the
freezer
it
as
if
they
knew
that
boyton
was
dead
and
why
did
it
take
two
of
them
to
search
dalgliesh
said
whatever
they
were
up
to
they
weren
moving
the
body
the
evidence
shows
he
died
where
he
was
found
don
find
their
actions
quite
as
odd
as
you
do
kate
people
do
behave
under
and
both
women
have
been
under
since
saturday
perhaps
they
were
second
death
on
the
other
hand
one
of
them
might
have
needed
to
ensure
that
the
freezer
was
opened
that
would
be
more
natural
action
if
the
search
so
far
had
been
benton
said
murder
or
no
murder
we
won
get
much
help
from
prints
they
both
opened
the
freezer
one
of
them
may
have
been
taking
good
care
that
she
did
would
there
have
been
prints
anyway
will
have
worn
gloves
kate
was
getting
impatient
not
if
he
was
boyton
alive
into
the
freezer
wouldn
you
find
that
bit
odd
if
you
been
boyton
and
isn
it
premature
to
start
using
the
word
we
don
know
whether
this
was
murder
the
three
of
them
were
getting
tired
the
fire
was
beginning
to
die
and
dalgliesh
decided
it
was
time
to
end
the
discussion
looking
back
he
felt
he
was
living
through
day
which
would
never
end
he
said
it
time
for
relatively
early
night
there
lot
to
do
tomorrow
ll
be
here
but
want
you
kate
with
benton
to
interview
boyton
partner
according
to
boyton
he
was
at
so
his
papers
and
should
be
there
we
re
not
going
to
get
anywhere
until
we
know
what
sort
of
man
he
was
and
if
possible
why
he
was
here
have
you
been
able
to
get
an
appointment
yet
kate
said
he
can
see
us
at
eleven
clock
sir
didn
say
who
was
coming
he
said
the
sooner
the
better
right
eleven
clock
in
then
and
we
ll
talk
before
you
leave
at
last
the
door
was
locked
behind
them
he
placed
the
guard
in
front
of
the
dying
fire
stood
for
moment
gazing
into
the
last
then
climbed
the
stairs
to
bed

size
the

even
in
its
winter
showed
signs
of
careful

the
hope
of
spring
was
by
stone
path
leading
to
painted
front

it
wasn
at
first
sight
house
which
benton
with
what
he
knew
of
robin
boyton
or
expected
of
his
friend
there
was
certain
feminine
elegance
about
the
and
he
recalled
reading
that
it
was
in
this
part
of
london
that
victorian
and
provided
houses
for
their
remembering

starting
up
bright
eyed
from
the
her
lover
one
hand
on
the
keys
reaching
out
to
her
in
recent
years
he
had
surprised
in
himself
for
victorian
painting
but
that
and
for
him
of
was
not
one
of
his
as
they
the
gate
the
door
opened
and
young
couple
were
gently
but
firmly
out
they
were
followed
by
an
elderly
man
neat
as
with
of
white
hair
and
which
no
winter
sun
could
have
produced
he
was
wearing
suit
with
the
of
which
diminished
his
frame
still
further
he
appeared
not
to
notice
the
but
his
voice
came
clearly
to
them
down
the
path

let
do
it
again
and
try

boy
to
look
confident
you

be
paying
the
for
god
sake
your
job
is
to
see
that
your
guest

being
worth
what
you

be
paying
for
it
and
happy
evening

don
know
what
you
re
doing
all
right
perhaps
you
better
come
in
and
we
ll
the
and
bit
the
couple
disappeared
inside
and
it
was
then
he
to
turn
his
attention
to
kate
and
benton
they
walked
up
to
him
and
kate

something
about
expecting
the
police
you
better
come
in
he
upstairs
in
the
office
they
passed
into
the
hall
benton
saw
through
the
open
door
to
the
left
that
small
table
for
two
had
been
set
with
four
glasses
in
each
place
and
of
and
the
couple
were
already
seated
staring
at
each
other

know
all
about
that
that
why
you
re
here
he
was
about
to
walk
up
the
stairs
but
at
that
moment
figure
appeared
at
the
top
he
was
tall
and
very
thin
with
black
hair
drawn
back
from
taut
pale
face
he
was
dressed
with
careful
which
with
his
dramatic
gave
him
the
appearance
of
male
model
posed
for
camera
his
close
fitting
black
trousers
looked
immaculate
his
jacket
was
benton
recognised
and
wished
he
could
afford
his
shirt
was
open
necked
and
he
wore
his
face
had
been
with
anxiety
but
now
the
features
with
relief
coming
down
to
meet
them
he
said
thank
god
you
ve
come
sorry
about
the
reception
ve
been
ve
been
told
nothing
absolutely
nothing
except
that
robin

course
he
rung
to
tell
me
about
rhoda
gradwyn
death
and
now
robin
you
wouldn
be
here
if
it
was
death
by
natural
have
to
know
was
it
suicide
did
he
leave
note
they
were
following
him
up
the
stairs
and
standing
aside
he
indicated
room
to
the
left
it
was
and
obviously
both
sitting
room
and
study
large
table
before
the
window
held
computer
machine
and
of
trays
three
smaller
mahogany
tables
one
with
balanced
were
crowded
with
ornaments
and
books
there
was
large
sofa
against
one
wall
but
hardly
since
it
was
covered
with
box
files
but
despite
the
an
attempt
at
order
and
had
been
made
there
was
only
one
chair
behind
the
desk
and
small
armchair
looked
round
as
if
expecting
third
to
then
went
across
the
hall
and
came
back
with
chair
which
he
placed
before
the
desk
they
seated
themselves
kate
said
there
was
no
note
would
you
be
surprised
if
it
were
suicide
god
yes
robin
had
his
but
he
wouldn
take
that
way
out
he
loved
life
and
he
had
friends
people
who
would
help
him
out
in
an
of
course
he
had
his
moments
of
don
we
all
but
with
robin
they
never
lasted
long
only
asked
about
the
note
because
any
is
even
less
he
had
no
enemies
benton
said
and
there
were
no
particular
at
present
nothing
you
know
which
could
have
driven
him
to
despair
nothing
obviously
he
was
by
rhoda
death
but
despair
isn
word
have
used
about
robin
he
was
always
hoping
something
would
turn
up
and
usually
it
did
and
things
were
going
rather
well
for
us
here
capital
was
problem
of
course
it
always
is
when
you
start
up
business
but
he
said
he
had
plans
that
he
was
expecting
money
big
money
he
wouldn
say
where
from
but
he
was
excited
happier
than
had
seen
him
for
years
rather
different
from
when
he
came
back
from
stoke
cheverell
three
weeks
ago
then
he
seemed
depressed
no
you
can
rule
out
suicide
but
as
said
nobody
told
me
anything
except
that
robin
dead
and
to
expect
visit
from
the
police
if
he
made
will
he
probably
named
me
as
an
and
he
always
put
me
down
as
next
of
kin
don
know
anyone
else
who
will
take
responsibility
for
his
stuff
here
or
for
the
funeral
so
why
the
secrecy
isn
it
time
you
came
clean
and
told
me
how
he
died
kate
said
we
don
know
for
certain
mr
we
may
know
more
when
we
get
the
of
the
which
should
be
later
today
well
where
was
he
found
kate
said
his
body
was
in
freezer
in
the
cottage
next
to
the
guest
cottage
where
he
was
staying
freezer
you
mean
one
of
those
rectangular
chest
for
long
term
yes
freezer
was
the
lid
open
the
lid
was
shut
we
don
yet
know
how
your
friend
came
to
be
in
there
it
could
have
been
an
accident
and
now
was
looking
at
them
in
stark
which
even
as
they
watched
turned
to
horror
there
was
pause
then
he
said
let
get
this
clear
you
re
telling
me
that
robin
body
was
found
shut
in
freezer
kate
said
patiently
yes
mr
but
we
don
yet
know
how
it
got
there
or
the
cause
of
death
he
shifted
his
gaze
wide
eyed
from
kate
to
benton
as
if
which
if
either
could
be
believed
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
the
note
of
barely
then
ll
tell
you
one
thing
this
was
no
accident
robin
was
seriously
he
never
travelled
by
air
or
on
the
he
couldn
enjoy
restaurant
meal
if
he
wasn
seated
close
to
the
door
he
was
fighting
it
but
not
successfully
nothing
and
no
one
would
ever
have
persuaded
him
to
climb
inside
freezer
benton
said
not
even
if
the
lid
was
propped
wide
open
he
never
believe
that
it
wouldn
fall
and
him
inside
what
you
re
investigating
is
murder
kate
could
have
said
that
it
was
possible
boyton
had
died
either
by
accident
or
natural
and
that
someone
for
reasons
unknown
had
placed
his
body
in
the
freezer
but
she
had
no
intention
of
with
instead
she
asked
was
it
generally
known
among
his
friends
that
he
was
was
now
still
gazing
from
kate
to
benton
willing
them
to
believe
some
may
have
known
or
guessed
suppose
but
never
heard
it
mentioned
it
something
he
was
rather
ashamed
of
particularly
not
being
able
to
fly
that
was
why
we
didn
have
foreign
holidays
unless
we
went
by
train
couldn
get
him
onto
even
if
him
up
at
the
bar
it
was
hell
of
an
inconvenience
if
he
told
anyone
it
would
have
been
rhoda
and
rhoda
dead
look
can
give
you
any
but
you
have
to
believe
me
about
one
thing
robin
would
never
have
got
into
freezer
alive
benton
asked
do
his
cousins
or
anyone
at
cheverell
manor
know
that
he
was
how
the
hell
do
know
ve
never
met
any
of
them
and
ve
never
been
there
you
ll
have
to
ask
them
his
had
cracked
he
sounded
close
to
tears
he
muttered
sorry
sorry
and
fell
silent
after
minute
in
which
he
stood
still
taking
deep
regular
as
if
they
were
an
exercise
in
control
he
said
robin
had
taken
to
going
to
the
manor
more
frequently
suppose
it
could
have
come
up
in
conversation
if
they
were
talking
about
holidays
or
the
hell
of
london
tube
at
rush
hour
kate
said
when
did
you
hear
about
rhoda
gradwyn
death
on
saturday
afternoon
robin
phoned
about
five
clock
how
did
he
sound
when
he
gave
you
the
news
how
would
you
expect
him
to
sound
inspector
he
wasn
exactly
ringing
to
after
my
health
oh
god
didn
mean
that
trying
to
be
helpful
it
just
that
still
trying
to
take
it
in
how
did
he
sound
he
was
almost
at
first
it
took
me
some
minutes
to
calm
him
down
after
that
well
you
can
take
your
pick
of
the
shocked
horrified
surprised
frightened
mostly
shocked
and
frightened
natural
reaction
he
just
been
told
that
close
friend
had
been
murdered
did
he
use
that
word
murdered
yes
he
did
reasonable
say
when
the
police
were
there
and
he
been
told
they
be
coming
to
interview
him
and
not
the
local
either
yard
he
didn
need
telling
that
this
wasn
natural
death
did
he
say
anything
about
how
miss
gradwyn
died
he
didn
know
he
was
pretty
that
no
one
at
the
manor
had
bothered
to
come
and
break
the
news
to
him
he
only
found
out
that
something
had
happened
when
the
police
cars
arrived
still
don
know
how
she
died
and
don
suppose
you
re
about
to
tell
me
kate
said
what
we
need
from
you
mr
is
anything
you
can
tell
us
about
robin
relationship
with
rhoda
gradwyn
and
of
course
with
you
we
now
have
two
suspicious
deaths
which
could
be
how
long
have
you
known
robin
about
seven
years
we
met
at
the
party
after
drama
school
in
which
he
had
not
particularly
distinguished
part
went
with
friend
who
and
robin
caught
my
eye
well
that
what
he
does
he
people
eyes
we
didn
speak
then
but
the
party
lingered
on
and
my
friend
who
had
another
date
had
left
by
the
time
the
last
bottle
was
finished
it
was
night
the
rain
down
and
could
see
robin
somewhat
waiting
for
bus
so
and
asked
if
could
drop
him
that
how
the
began
benton
said
and
you
became
friends
we
became
friends
and
later
business
nothing
formal
but
we
worked
together
he
had
the
ideas
and
had
the
experience
and
at
least
the
hope
of
raising
money
ll
answer
the
question
you
re
thinking
of
way
to
ask
we
were
friends
not
lovers
not
fellow
not
not
drinking
friends
liked
him
and
suppose
we
were
useful
to
each
other
told
him
inherited
just
over
million
from
aunt
who
recently
died
the
aunt
was
genuine
enough
but
the
old
dear
hadn
to
leave
actually
was
lucky
in
the
don
quite
know
why
bothering
to
tell
you
this
except
you
ll
no
doubt
find
out
sooner
or
later
when
you
start
wondering
whether
have
any
financial
interest
in
robin
death
haven
doubt
whether
he
left
anything
but
and
the
jumble
of
things
mostly
clothes
that
he
dumped
here
did
you
ever
tell
him
about
the
win
no
didn
never
think
it
wise
to
tell
people
if
you
have
big
win
they
simply
take
the
view
that
since
you
ve
done
nothing
to
your
luck
you
have
an
to
share
it
with
the
equally
robin
fell
for
the
rich
story
over
million
on
this
house
and
it
was
his
idea
that
we
started
for
the
newly
rich
or
social
who
don
want
to
be
embarrassed
every
time
they
the
boss
or
take
girl
out
to
dinner
at
decent
restaurant
benton
said
thought
the
very
rich
didn
care
one
way
or
another
don
they
make
their
own
rules
we
don
expect
to
attract
but
most
people
care
believe
me
this
is
an
mobile
no
one
likes
to
be
and
we
re
doing
well
we
ve
got
twenty
eight
clients
already
and
they
pay
five
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
for
four
week
course
part
time
that
is
cheap
at
the
price
it
the
only
one
of
robin
that
ever
showed
any
promise
of
making
money
he
got
out
of
his
flat
couple
of
weeks
ago
so
he
been
living
here
in
one
room
at
the
back
he
isn
he
wasn
exactly
considerate
house
guest
but
basically
it
us
both
he
kept
an
eye
on
the
house
and
he
was
here
when
it
was
his
turn
to
take
class
it
might
be
hard
to
believe
but
he
was
good
teacher
and
he
knew
his
stuff
the
clients
liked
him
the
problem
with
robin
is
that
he
is
was
and
one
minute
and
off
after
some
new
the
next
he
could
be
but
never
wanted
to
cast
him
off
it
just
never
occurred
to
me
if
you
can
explain
the
which
keeps
people
together
be
interested
to
hear
it
and
what
about
his
relationship
with
rhoda
gradwyn
ah
that
more
difficult
he
didn
talk
much
about
her
but
he
obviously
liked
having
her
as
friend
it
gave
him
in
his
own
eyes
which
is
what
matters
after
all
kate
said
was
it
sex
oh
hardly
fancy
that
the
lady
with
bigger
fish
than
robin
and
doubt
whether
she
fancied
him
people
don
too
beautiful
perhaps
bit
rather
like
making
love
to
sex
wasn
important
to
him
but
she
was
think
she
represented
authority
he
did
once
say
that
he
could
talk
to
her
and
be
told
the
truth
or
what
for
it
used
to
wonder
if
she
reminded
him
of
someone
who
had
influenced
him
that
way
perhaps
and
he
lost
his
mother
when
he
was
seven
some
kids
never
get
over
that
he
could
ve
been
looking
for
know
but
there
could
be
something
in
it
benton
reflected
that
wasn
word
he
have
used
of
rhoda
gradwyn
but
then
what
did
they
really
know
about
her
wasn
that
part
of
the
fascination
of
his
job
the
of
other
people
he
asked
did
robin
tell
you
that
miss
gradwyn
was
having
scar
removed
and
where
it
was
being
done
no
and
not
surprised
mean
not
surprised
he
didn
tell
me
she
probably
asked
him
to
keep
it
secret
robin
could
keep
secret
if
he
thought
it
was
worth
his
while
all
he
said
was
that
he
was
having
few
days
in
the
guest
cottage
at
stoke
cheverell
he
never
mentioned
that
rhoda
would
be
there
kate
asked
what
was
his
mood
did
he
seem
excited
or
did
you
get
the
impression
that
this
was
just
routine
visit
like
said
he
was
depressed
when
he
got
back
after
the
first
visit
but
excited
when
he
set
off
last
thursday
night
ve
seldom
seen
him
happier
he
said
something
about
having
good
news
for
me
when
he
got
back
but
didn
take
that
seriously
robin
good
news
usually
turned
out
to
be
bad
news
or
no
news
at
all
apart
from
that
first
call
did
he
speak
to
you
again
from
stoke
cheverell
yes
he
did
he
gave
me
ring
after
you
interviewed
him
he
said
you
were
pretty
rough
with
him
not
particularly
considerate
to
man
for
friend
kate
said
sorry
he
felt
that
he
made
no
formal
complaint
of
his
treatment
would
you
in
his
place
only
or
the
very
powerful
the
police
after
all
you
didn
exactly
set
about
him
with
anyway
he
did
ring
me
again
after
you
interviewed
him
in
the
cottage
and
told
him
to
come
to
me
and
let
the
police
him
here
where
arrange
for
my
solicitor
to
be
present
if
necessary
it
wasn
entirely
we
re
busy
and
needed
him
here
he
said
he
was
determined
to
stay
on
for
the
week
he
booked
he
talked
about
not
her
in
death
bit
but
that
was
robin
of
course
he
knew
more
about
it
by
then
and
told
me
that
she
been
found
dead
at
seven
thirty
on
the
saturday
morning
and
that
it
looked
like
an
inside
job
after
that
rang
him
again
several
times
on
his
mobile
but
couldn
get
reply
left
messages
asking
him
to
ring
back
but
he
never
did
benton
said
when
he
first
rang
you
said
he
sounded
frightened
didn
it
you
as
odd
that
he
was
preparing
to
stay
on
with
murderer
on
the
loose
yes
it
did
pressed
him
and
he
said
he
had
unfinished
business
there
was
silence
kate
voice
was
deliberately
unfinished
business
did
he
give
you
any
what
he
meant
no
and
didn
ask
as
ve
said
robin
could
be
perhaps
he
thought
of
hand
in
the
investigation
he
been
reading
detective
story
which
you
ll
probably
find
in
his
room
you
ll
want
to
see
the
room
suppose
yes
said
kate
as
soon
as
we
ve
finished
speaking
to
you
there
one
other
thing
where
were
you
between
the
hours
of
four
thirty
last
friday
afternoon
and
seven
thirty
the
next
morning
was
thought
you
get
round
to
that
was
here
from
three
thirty
until
seven
thirty
three
with
in
between
then
made
myself
watched
tv
until
ten
clock
and
went
to
the
pub
thanks
to
benign
government
which
us
to
drink
until
the
early
hours
that
what
did
the
landlord
was
and
he
can
confirm
that
was
there
until
about
one
fifteen
and
if
you
care
to
tell
me
when
robin
died
could
an
equally
alibi
we
don
know
yet
mr
exactly
when
he
did
die
but
it
was
on
monday
probably
between
the
hours
of
one
clock
and
eight
look
it
seems
ludicrous
to
be
an
alibi
for
robin
death
but
suppose
you
have
to
ask
for
me
there
no
problem
here
at
half
past
one
with
one
of
our
temporary
teachers
you
met
him
at
the
door
at
three
clock
had
an
afternoon
session
with
two
new
clients
can
give
you
their
names
and
and
will
confirm
the
lunch
kate
asked
at
what
time
did
the
afternoon
lesson
end
well
they
were
supposed
to
get
an
hour
but
had
no
immediate
so
let
it
over
run
bit
it
was
half
past
four
by
the
time
they
left
then
worked
here
in
the
office
until
six
when
went
to
the
pub
the
new
in
road
met
can
give
you
his
name
and
address
and
was
there
with
him
until
about
eleven
when
walked
home
ll
have
to
look
in
my
address
book
for
the
and
phone
numbers
but
ll
do
that
now
if
you
can
wait
they
waited
while
he
went
to
the
desk
and
within
few
minutes
of
through
his
address
book
found
piece
of
paper
in
his
desk
drawer
the
information
and
handed
over
the
paper
he
said
if
you
have
to
check
be
glad
if
you
make
it
plain
that
not
suspect
it
bad
enough
trying
to
come
to
terms
with
the
loss
of
robin
it
hasn
hit
me
yet
perhaps
because
still
can
believe
it
but
believe
me
it
will
and
don
fancy
being
seen
as
his
murderer
benton
said
if
what
you
ve
told
us
is
confirmed
don
think
there
ll
be
any
risk
of
that
sir
nor
would
there
if
the
facts
were
accurate
the
only
time
when
was
alone
was
the
hour
and
half
between
the
end
of
his
lesson
and
his
arrival
at
the
pub
and
that
wouldn
have
given
him
time
even
to
get
to
stoke
cheverell
kate
said
we
like
now
to
have
look
at
mr
boyton
room
suppose
it
hasn
been
locked
since
his
death
said
it
couldn
be
there
isn
lock
anyway
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
it
needed
to
be
locked
if
you
expected
that
surely
you
have
phoned
me
as
keep
saying
haven
been
told
anything
until
your
arrival
today
kate
said
don
expect
it
important
take
it
no
one
been
in
the
room
since
his
death
no
one
not
even
me
the
place
depressed
me
when
he
was
alive
can
face
it
now
the
room
was
down
the
landing
at
the
back
it
was
large
and
well
with
two
windows
looking
out
over
the
lawn
with
its
central
and
beyond
it
the
canal
without
entering
the
room
said
sorry
it
in
such
mess
robin
only
moved
in
two
weeks
ago
and
everything
he
owns
has
been
dumped
here
except
the
stuff
he
gave
away
to
or
sold
at
the
pub
and
don
suppose
there
were
many
the
room
was
certainly
there
was
single
to
the
left
of
the
door
piled
high
with
clothes
the
doors
of
mahogany
wardrobe
stood
open
revealing
shirts
and
trousers
crammed
on
metal
there
were
half
large
square
boxes
with
the
name
of
firm
and
three
bulging
black
plastic
bags
on
top
in
the
corner
to
the
right
of
the
door
were
of
books
and
cardboard
filled
with
magazines
between
the
two
windows
desk
with
drawers
and
cupboard
on
each
side
held
laptop
and
an
reading
lamp
the
room
smelled
of
clothes
said
the
laptop
is
new
bought
by
me
robin
was
supposed
to
help
with
some
of
the
but
he
didn
get
down
to
it
imagine
that
the
only
thing
in
the
room
worth
anything
he
always
been
untidy
we
had
bit
of
row
just
before
he
left
for
dorset
complained
that
he
could
at
least
have
got
his
clothes
before
he
moved
of
course
now
feel
mean
bastard
suppose
always
shall
it
irrational
but
there
it
is
anyway
all
he
as
far
as
know
is
in
this
room
and
as
far
as
concerned
you
re
welcome
to
through
it
he
hasn
any
to
object
at
least
he
did
mention
father
but
gather
they
haven
been
in
touch
since
he
was
boy
you
ll
find
the
two
drawers
in
the
desk
are
locked
but
don
have
key
benton
said
don
see
why
you
should
feel
guilty
the
room
is
mess
he
could
at
least
have
gone
to
the
before
he
moved
in
you
were
only
speaking
the
truth
but
being
untidy
isn
exactly
high
moral
and
what
the
hell
did
it
matter
not
worth
shouting
about
and
knew
what
he
was
like
some
licence
is
surely
due
to
friend
benton
said
but
we
can
watch
our
words
just
because
friend
might
die
before
we
have
chance
to
put
things
right
kate
thought
it
was
time
to
move
on
benton
seemed
inclined
to
given
the
chance
he
would
probably
discussion
about
the
relative
of
friendship
and
truth
she
said
we
ve
got
his
key
ring
the
key
to
the
drawers
is
probably
there
if
there
lot
of
paper
we
may
need
bag
to
carry
it
away
ll
give
you
you
can
carry
it
all
away
inspector
shove
it
in
police
van
it
it
me
give
me
call
when
you
re
ready
to
go
his
voice
broke
and
he
sounded
close
to
tears
without
another
word
he
disappeared
benton
walked
over
to
the
window
and
opened
it
wide
the
fresh
air
flowed
in
benton
said
is
this
too
much
for
you
ma
am
no
benton
leave
it
open
how
on
earth
can
anybody
live
like
this
it
looks
as
if
he
didn
make
the
slightest
effort
to
keep
the
room
let
hope
we
ve
got
the
desk
key
it
wasn
difficult
to
identify
the
one
they
needed
it
was
by
far
the
smallest
of
the
bunch
and
it
fitted
easily
into
the
lock
of
both
drawers
they
the
left
hand
one
first
but
kate
had
to
it
open
against
of
paper
at
the
back
as
she
it
open
old
bills
an
out
of
date
some
christmas
cards
and
collection
of
letters
from
it
and
the
floor
benton
opened
the
cupboard
and
that
too
was
crammed
with
bulging
files
old
theatre
and
photographs
wash
bag
which
when
opened
revealed
old
stage
make
up
kate
said
we
won
bother
to
go
through
all
this
mess
now
let
see
if
we
get
more
from
the
other
drawer
this
more
easily
to
her
pull
it
contained
folder
and
book
the
book
was
an
old
death
by
and
the
folder
contained
only
one
sheet
of
paper
with
writing
on
both
sides
it
was
copy
of
will
headed
the
last
will
and
of
peregrine
westhall
and
dated
in
letters
on
the
last
page
witness
my
hand
this
seventh
day
of
two
thousand
and
five
with
the
will
was
for
five
pounds
from
the
probate
office
the
whole
was
black
upright
hand
strong
in
places
but
becoming
more
shaky
in
the
last
paragraph
the
first
paragraph
his
son
marcus
st
john
westhall
his
daughter
candace
westhall
and
his
price
as
the
second
paragraph
expressed
his
wish
for
private
with
no
one
present
other
than
immediate
family
no
religious
and
no
later
memorial
service
the
third
paragraph
the
writing
here
rather
larger
stated

all
my
books
to
college
any
which
the
college
does
not
wish
to
have
to
be
sold
or
otherwise

as
my
son
marcus
st
john
westhall
shall
decide
give
all
else
that

money
and
in
equal
measure
to
my
two
