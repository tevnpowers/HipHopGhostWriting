to
sit
with
one
will
believe
it
benton
spoke
does
the
motive
matter
now
sir
mean
it
would
if
the
case
came
to
court
want
motive
and
so
do
we
but
you
ve
always
said
that
physical
evidence
hard
facts
not
motive
prove
the
case
motive
will
always
remain
mysterious
we
can
see
into
another
mind
candace
westhall
has
given
us
hers
it
may
seem
inadequate
but
motive
for
murder
always
is
don
see
how
we
can
what
she
says
not
to
benton
at
least
not
she
has
made
what
is
essentially
supported
by
evidence
my
difficulty
is
in
it
the
case
hasn
exactly
been
triumph
for
us
it
over
now
or
will
be
after
the
inquest
there
are
number
of
odd
things
that
come
to
mind
about
her
account
of
boyton
death
let
take
that
part
of
the
first
benton
couldn
resist
the
temptation
to
break
in
why
did
she
need
to
tell
it
all
again
we
already
had
her
statement
about
boyton
suspicions
and
her
decision
to
him
along
kate
said
it
as
if
she
needed
to
record
it
on
the
and
she
more
time
on
how
boyton
died
than
she
does
on
rhoda
gradwyn
murder
is
she
trying
to
attention
from
something
far
more
than
boyton
ridiculous
suspicion
about
the
freezer
dalgliesh
said
think
she
is
she
was
determined
that
no
one
should
suspect
that
why
it
was
for
her
that
the
should
be
found
to
leave
it
in
the
car
or
on
of
clothes
on
the
beach
would
have
its
loss
so
she
with
it
in
her
hand
benton
looked
at
dalgliesh
are
you
going
to
challenge
this
sir
to
what
point
benton
we
may
have
our
suspicions
our
own
about
motive
and
they
may
be
rational
but
it
all
evidence
and
none
of
it
can
be
proved
you
can
or
charge
the
dead
perhaps
it
this
need
to
know
the
truth
benton
said
it
takes
courage
to
kill
yourself
with
lie
on
your
lips
but
perhaps
that
my
religious
education
it
to
at
times
dalgliesh
said
have
this
appointment
tomorrow
with
with
the
suicide
the
investigation
is
over
you
should
be
able
to
get
away
by
tomorrow
afternoon
he
didn
add
and
perhaps
by
tomorrow
afternoon
the
investigation
will
be
over
for
me
this
one
might
well
be
his
last
he
could
have
wished
that
it
had
ended
differently
but
at
least
it
still
had
hope
of
ending
with
as
much
of
the
truth
as
anyone
other
than
candace
westhall
could
hope
to
know
by
midday
on
friday
benton
and
kate
had
made
their
george
chandler
powell
had
gathered
together
the
household
in
the
library
and
all
had
shaken
hands
and
either
muttered
their
or
spoken
them
clearly
with
kate
felt
of
she
knew
without
resentment
that
the
air
of
the
manor
would
feel
newly
once
they
had
perhaps
this
group
goodbye
had
been
arranged
by
mr
chandler
powell
to
get
necessary
over
with
of
they
had
had
farewell
from
wisteria
house
where
they
were
treated
by
the
as
if
they
had
been
regular
and
welcome
guests
in
any
investigation
there
were
places
or
people
which
remained
happily
in
memory
and
for
kate
the
and
wisteria
house
would
be
one
dalgliesh
she
knew
would
be
tied
up
for
part
of
the
morning
with
his
interview
with
the
coroner
officer
and
saying
his
to
the
chief
and
his
for
the
help
and
co
operation
his
force
had
provided
particularly
dc
warren
then
he
planned
to
drive
to
bournemouth
for
his
interview
with
he
had
already
made
his
formal
to
mr
chandler
powell
and
the
small
group
at
the
manor
but
he
would
be
returning
to
the
old
police
cottage
to
collect
his
now
kate
asked
benton
to
stop
there
and
wait
in
the
car
so
that
she
could
check
that
the
dorset
police
had
removed
all
their
equipment
she
knew
that
the
kitchen
would
need
no
checking
to
ensure
that
it
was
clean
and
going
upstairs
she
saw
that
the
bed
had
been
stripped
and
the
neatly
folded
during
the
years
she
and
dalgliesh
had
worked
together
she
had
always
experienced
this
slight
of
regret
when
case
was
over
and
the
place
in
which
they
had
met
sat
and
talked
at
the
end
of
the
day
however
short
their
stay
was
finally
left
vacant
dalgliesh
grip
was
downstairs
ready
packed
and
she
knew
that
his
murder
bag
would
be
with
him
in
the
car
the
only
equipment
remaining
to
be
moved
was
the
computer
and
on
impulse
she
typed
in
her
own
single
came
up
on
the
screen
kate
an
is
an
inappropriate
way
in
which
to
convey
something
important
but
have
to
be
sure
that
this
you
and
if
you
it
it
will
be
less
than
letter
have
been
living
like
for
the
last
six
months
to
prove
something
to
myself
and
know
now
that
you
were
right
life
is
too
and
too
short
to
waste
time
on
people
we
don
care
for
and
much
too
to
give
up
on
love
there
are
two
things
want
to
say
which
didn
say
when
you
said
goodbye
because
they
would
have
sounded
like
excuses
suppose
that
what
they
are
but
need
you
to
know
the
girl
you
saw
me
with
was
the
first
and
last
since
we
became
lovers
you
know
never
lie
to
you
the
beds
in
are
very
hard
and
lonely
and
the
food
is
terrible
my
love
she
sat
for
moment
in
silence
which
must
have
lasted
longer
than
she
thought
because
it
was
broken
by
the
of
benton
car
but
she
didn
need
to
pause
for
more
than
second
smiling
she
in
her
reply
your
message
received
and
understood
the
case
here
is
finished
although
not
happily
and
shall
be
back
in
by
seven
why
not
say
goodbye
to
the
and
come
home
kate
standing
on
high
some
three
miles
west
of
bournemouth
was
approached
by
short
drive
which
between
trees
and
bushes
to
an
front
door
its
otherwise
agreeable
were
by
modern
and
large
parking
lot
to
the
left
care
had
been
taken
not
to
distress
visitors
by
any
notice
bearing
the
words
retirement
elderly
nursing
or
home
highly
polished
and
placed
on
the
wall
beside
the
iron
gates
merely
bore
the
name
of
the
house
the
doorbell
was
answered
quickly
by
in
short
white
jacket
who
directed
dalgliesh
to
reception
desk
at
the
end
of
the
hall
here
grey
haired
woman
and
wearing
and
checked
his
name
in
the
book
of
expected
visitors
and
told
him
that
mr
was
expecting
him
and
would
be
found
in
the
front
room
on
the
first
floor
would
mr
dalgliesh
prefer
the
stairs
or
the
lift
charles
would
take
him
up
for
the
stairs
dalgliesh
followed
the
young
man
who
had
opened
the
door
up
the
wide
mahogany
stairs
the
walls
of
the
staircase
and
corridor
above
were
hung
with
prints
and
one
or
two
and
on
small
tables
placed
against
the
wall
were
of
flowers
and
carefully
arranged
china
ornaments
most
of
everything
about
in
its
shiny
was
impersonal
and
to
dalgliesh
depressing
for
him
any
institution
which
people
from
one
another
however
necessary
or
benign
an
unease
which
he
could
trace
back
to
his
school
days
his
had
no
need
to
knock
at
the
door
of
it
was
already
open
with
balanced
on
awaiting
him
charles
made
exit
shook
hands
and
standing
aside
said
please
come
in
you
re
here
of
course
to
talk
about
candace
westhall
death
haven
been
shown
her
but
marcus
telephoned
our
office
in
and
my
brother
rang
me
it
was
good
of
you
to
telephone
in
advance
with
the
approach
of
death
one
the
taste
for
surprise
usually
sit
in
this
armchair
beside
the
fireplace
if
you
care
to
draw
up
second
easy
chair
think
you
ll
find
it
comfortable
they
seated
themselves
and
dalgliesh
placed
his
briefcase
on
the
table
between
them
it
seemed
to
dalgliesh
that
was
aged
by
his
illness
the
hair
was
carefully
over
marked
with
scars
perhaps
the
evidence
of
old
his
yellow
skin
was
stretched
across
the
sharp
bones
of
his
face
which
might
once
have
been
handsome
but
was
now
mottled
and
criss
crossed
as
if
with
the
of
age
he
was
as
carefully
dressed
as
an
elderly
but
the
neck
rose
from
pristine
white
which
was
at
least
size
too
large
he
looked
both
vulnerable
and
but
his
although
cold
had
been
firm
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
low
but
the
formed
without
apparent
strain
neither
the
size
of
the
room
nor
the
quality
and
variety
of
the
pieces
of
furniture
could
the
fact
that
this
was
there
was
single
bed
set
against
the
wall
to
the
right
of
the
windows
and
screen
which
seen
from
the
door
didn
completely
the
and
drugs
cabinet
close
to
the
bed
was
door
which
dalgliesh
must
lead
to
the
bathroom
there
was
only
one
top
window
open
but
the
air
was
without
even
the
faint
of
which
dalgliesh
found
more
than
the
smell
of
would
have
been
there
was
no
fire
in
the
grate
not
surprisingly
in
the
of
an
patient
but
the
room
was
warm
so
the
central
must
be
on
full
but
the
empty
grate
was
the
bore
only
the
figure
of
and
woman
holding
garden
an
which
dalgliesh
doubted
was
choice
but
there
were
worse
rooms
in
which
to
house
arrest
or
something
like
it
the
only
of
furniture
which
dalgliesh
thought
had
brought
with
him
was
long
oak
bookcase
the
so
tightly
packed
that
they
looked
together
glancing
at
the
window
dalgliesh
said
you
have
an
impressive
view
indeed
yes
as
am
frequently
reminded
regarded
as
to
have
this
room
too
in
being
able
to
afford
this
place
unlike
some
other
nursing
they
to
care
for
one
if
necessary
until
death
perhaps
you
like
to
take
closer
look
at
the
view
it
was
an
unusual
suggestion
but
dalgliesh
followed
painful
steps
to
the
bay
window
with
two
smaller
windows
it
which
gave
of
the
english
the
morning
was
grey
with
rare
and
sunlight
the
poorly
line
between
the
sea
and
sky
under
the
windows
was
stone
with
three
wooden
regularly
placed
beneath
them
the
ground
fell
away
some
feet
to
the
sea
in
of
trees
and
bushes
thick
with
the
strong
glossy
leaves
of
only
where
the
bushes
could
dalgliesh
glimpse
the
occasional
on
the
walking
like
passing
shadows
on
silent
feet
said
can
only
see
the
view
if
stand
and
that
is
now
something
of
an
effort
ve
become
too
familiar
with
the
changes
the
sky
the
sea
the
trees
some
of
the
bushes
human
life
is
below
me
out
of
reach
since
have
no
wish
to
concern
myself
with
these
almost
invisible
figures
why
do
feel
of
which
do
nothing
to
invite
and
would
strongly
dislike
my
fellow
guests
we
do
not
to
patients
in
have
long
exhausted
the
few
which
they
have
any
interest
in
discussing
the
food
the
weather
the
staff
last
night
television
and
each
other
irritating
it
mistake
to
live
until
you
each
morning
light
not
with
relief
and
certainly
not
with
but
with
disappointment
and
regret
that
sometimes
close
to
despair
have
not
quite
reached
that
stage
but
it
coming
as
of
course
is
the
final
darkness
mention
death
not
to
note
into
our
conversation
or
god
to
invite
pity
but
it
as
well
before
we
talk
to
know
where
we
stand
you
and
mr
dalgliesh
will
see
things
differently
but
you
re
not
here
to
discuss
the
view
perhaps
we
should
get
down
to
business
dalgliesh
opened
his
briefcase
and
placed
on
the
table
robin
boyton
copy
of
peregrine
westhall
will
he
said
it
good
of
you
to
see
me
please
say
if
you
think
it
unlikely
commander
that
you
will
either
or
bore
me
beyond
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
used
dalgliesh
rank
dalgliesh
said
my
understanding
is
that
you
acted
for
the
westhall
family
in
the
matter
of
both
the
grandfather
and
father
wills
not
the
family
firm
since
my
admission
here
eleven
months
ago
the
routine
work
has
been
done
by
my
younger
brother
in
the
office
in
he
did
however
keep
me
informed
so
you
weren
present
when
this
will
was
drawn
up
or
signed
no
member
of
the
firm
was
copy
wasn
sent
to
us
at
the
time
it
was
made
and
neither
we
nor
the
family
were
aware
of
its
existence
until
three
days
after
peregrine
westhall
died
when
candace
found
it
in
locked
drawer
in
cabinet
in
the
bedroom
where
the
old
man
kept
confidential
papers
as
you
may
have
been
told
peregrine
westhall
was
given
to
drawing
up
wills
when
he
was
in
the
same
nursing
home
as
his
late
father
most
were
in
his
own
hand
and
by
the
nurses
he
seemed
to
have
taken
as
much
pleasure
in
them
as
he
did
in
writing
them
imagine
the
was
designed
to
impress
upon
his
family
that
he
had
power
at
any
time
to
change
his
mind
so
the
will
wasn
hidden
apparently
not
candace
said
there
was
in
drawer
in
the
bedroom
cabinet
to
which
he
kept
the
key
under
his
pillow
dalgliesh
said
at
the
time
it
was
signed
was
her
father
still
able
to
get
out
of
bed
to
put
it
there
he
must
have
been
unless
one
of
the
or
visitor
placed
it
there
at
his
request
no
one
in
the
family
or
household
to
knowledge
of
it
of
course
we
have
no
idea
when
it
was
actually
placed
in
the
drawer
it
could
have
been
shortly
after
it
was
drawn
up
when
peregrine
westhall
was
certainly
capable
of
walking
to
whom
was
the
addressed
no
was
produced
candace
said
she
thrown
it
away
but
you
were
sent
copy
of
the
will
yes
by
my
brother
he
knew
that
would
be
interested
in
anything
my
old
clients
perhaps
he
wanted
to
make
me
feel
was
still
involved
this
is
getting
close
to
cross
examination
commander
please
don
think
it
some
time
since
was
required
to
use
my
and
when
you
saw
the
will
you
had
no
doubt
about
its
none
and
have
none
now
why
should
as
expect
you
know
will
is
as
as
any
other
provided
it
signed
dated
and
and
no
one
familiar
with
peregrine
westhall
hand
could
possibly
doubt
that
he
wrote
this
will
the
are
precisely
those
made
in
previous
will
not
the
one
immediately
this
but
one
which
was
typed
in
my
office
in
taken
by
me
to
the
house
in
which
he
was
then
living
and
by
two
of
my
staff
who
came
with
me
for
that
purpose
the
were
reasonable
with
the
of
his
library
which
was
left
to
his
school
if
they
wanted
it
but
otherwise
was
to
be
sold
all
that
he
possessed
was
left
in
equal
to
marcus
his
son
and
his
daughter
candace
so
in
this
he
was
just
to
the
despised
sex
had
some
influence
on
him
while
was
in
practice
it
was
there
any
other
will
which
this
for
which
probate
has
now
been
granted
yes
one
made
in
the
month
before
peregrine
westhall
left
the
nursing
home
and
moved
to
stone
cottage
with
candace
and
marcus
you
may
as
well
have
sight
of
it
this
too
was
it
will
give
you
the
opportunity
to
the
writing
if
you
ll
kindly
the
and
lift
the
lid
you
ll
find
black
box
it
the
only
one
have
brought
with
me
perhaps
needed
it
as
kind
of
an
assurance
that
one
day
might
be
working
again
he
his
long
fingers
in
an
inner
pocket
and
produced
key
dalgliesh
brought
over
the
box
and
placed
it
before
him
the
smaller
key
on
the
same
ring
unlocked
it
the
solicitor
said
here
as
you
will
see
he
the
previous
will
and
leaves
half
the
estate
to
his
robin
boyton
the
remaining
half
to
be
divided
equally
between
marcus
and
candace
if
you
the
handwriting
on
both
these
wills
think
you
will
find
it
by
the
same
hand
as
with
the
later
will
the
writing
was
strong
black
and
distinctive
surprisingly
so
from
an
old
man
the
letters
tall
the
heavy
the
lines
thin
he
said
and
of
course
neither
you
nor
any
member
of
your
firm
would
have
robin
boyton
of
his
good
fortune
it
would
have
been
seriously
as
far
as
know
he
neither
knew
nor
dalgliesh
said
and
even
if
he
had
known
he
could
hardly
challenge
the
later
will
once
probate
had
been
granted
and
nor
suggest
can
you
commander
after
pause
he
went
on
have
to
your
questions
now
there
is
one
need
to
ask
are
you
completely
satisfied
that
candace
westhall
murdered
both
robin
boyton
and
rhoda
gradwyn
and
attempted
to
murder
sharon
bateman
dalgliesh
said
yes
to
the
first
part
of
your
question
don
believe
the
in
its
but
in
one
respect
it
true
she
both
murdered
miss
gradwyn
and
was
responsible
for
the
death
of
mr
boyton
she
has
confessed
to
planning
the
murder
of
sharon
bateman
by
then
she
must
have
made
up
her
mind
to
kill
herself
once
she
suspected
that
knew
the
truth
about
the
last
will
she
couldn
risk
cross
examination
in
court
said
the
truth
about
the
last
will
thought
we
would
come
to
that
but
do
you
know
the
truth
and
even
if
you
do
would
it
stand
up
in
court
if
she
were
alive
and
were
of
the
both
of
her
father
and
the
two
the
legal
over
the
will
with
boyton
dead
would
be
considerable
it
pity
can
discuss
some
of
them
with
my
colleagues
he
seemed
almost
for
the
first
time
since
dalgliesh
had
entered
the
room
dalgliesh
asked
and
what
under
would
you
have
said
about
the
will
that
regarded
it
as
and
had
no
suspicions
about
the
either
of
the
or
of
the
the
writing
on
these
two
wills
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
they
are
by
the
same
hand
commander
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
and
nothing
you
need
to
do
this
will
could
only
have
been
by
robin
boyton
and
boyton
is
dead
neither
you
nor
the
police
have
any
in
this
matter
you
have
your
you
have
your
the
case
is
closed
the
money
was
to
the
two
people
who
had
the
best
right
to
it
dalgliesh
said
accept
that
given
the
nothing
more
can
reasonably
be
done
but
don
like
unfinished
business
needed
to
know
if
was
right
and
if
possible
to
understand
you
have
been
very
helpful
now
know
the
truth
as
it
can
be
known
and
think
understand
why
she
did
it
or
is
that
too
claim
to
know
the
truth
and
to
understand
it
yes
with
respect
commander
think
it
is
an
arrogance
and
perhaps
an
impertinence
how
we
around
in
the
lives
of
the
famous
dead
like
at
every
piece
of
gossip
and
scandal
and
now
have
question
for
you
would
you
be
willing
to
break
the
law
if
by
doing
so
you
could
right
wrong
or
benefit
person
you
loved
dalgliesh
said
but
the
question
is
it
must
on
the
importance
and
of
the
law
would
be
breaking
and
whether
the
good
to
the
loved
person
or
indeed
the
public
good
would
in
my
judgement
be
greater
than
the
harm
of
breaking
the
law
with
certain
murder
and
for
example
how
could
it
ever
be
the
question
can
be
considered
in
the
police
officer
not
moral
or
an
oh
but
you
are
commander
with
the
death
of
what
smith
described
as
rational
religion
and
the
of
what
remains
sending
out
such
confusing
and
uncertain
messages
all
people
have
to
be
we
must
work
out
our
own
with
based
on
what
we
believe
so
tell
me
are
there
any
circumstances
in
which
you
would
break
the
law
to
benefit
another
benefit
in
what
way
in
any
way
benefit
can
be
to
need
to
to
right
wrong
dalgliesh
said
then
put
so
think
the
answer
must
be
yes
could
for
example
see
myself
helping
someone
loved
to
death
if
she
were
being
stretched
out
on
of
this
world
and
every
breath
was
drawn
in
hope
wouldn
need
to
but
since
you
re
the
question
yes
can
see
myself
breaking
the
law
to
advantage
someone
loved
not
so
sure
about
wrong
that
would
have
the
wisdom
to
decide
what
is
in
fact
right
and
what
is
wrong
and
the
to
consider
whether
any
action
could
take
would
make
things
better
or
worse
now
could
put
question
to
you
forgive
me
if
you
find
it
would
the
loved
person
for
you
be
candace
westhall
got
painfully
to
his
feet
and
his
moved
over
to
the
window
and
stood
for
some
moments
looking
out
as
if
there
were
world
outside
where
such
question
would
never
be
put
or
if
put
would
no
answer
dalgliesh
waited
then
turned
back
to
him
and
dalgliesh
watched
while
like
someone
learning
for
the
first
time
how
to
walk
he
made
his
way
with
uncertain
steps
back
to
his
chair
he
said
going
to
tell
you
something
that
have
never
told
another
human
being
and
never
shall
do
that
because
believe
that
with
you
it
will
be
safe
and
perhaps
there
comes
time
at
the
end
of
life
when
secret
burden
which
one
to
place
on
another
shoulders
as
if
the
mere
fact
that
someone
else
knows
it
and
will
share
in
its
keeping
somehow
the
weight
suppose
that
why
religious
people
go
to
what
an
extraordinary
ritual
that
must
be
however
that
not
open
to
me
and
don
propose
to
change
non
belief
for
what
to
me
would
be
comfort
at
the
end
so
shall
tell
you
it
will
no
burden
on
you
and
no
distress
and
am
speaking
to
adam
dalgliesh
the
poet
not
adam
dalgliesh
the
detective
dalgliesh
said
at
the
moment
there
can
be
no
difference
between
them
not
in
your
mind
commander
but
there
can
be
in
mine
and
there
another
reason
for
speaking
not
but
then
which
of
them
is
can
tell
you
what
pleasure
it
is
to
talk
to
man
about
something
other
than
the
state
of
my
health
the
first
thing
the
staff
or
any
visitor
and
the
last
is
how
am
feeling
that
how
defined
now
by
and
no
doubt
you
find
it
difficult
to
be
polite
when
people
on
talking
about
your
try
to
be
since
they
mean
to
be
kind
but
hate
it
and
it
isn
easy
so
ll
keep
off
the
if
you
will
keep
off
the
state
of
my
he
laughed
high
but
of
breath
cut
short
it
sounded
more
like
cry
of
pain
dalgliesh
waited
without
speaking
seemed
to
be
his
strength
to
be
settling
his
form
back
more
comfortably
in
his
chair
he
said
basically
it
commonplace
story
it
happens
everywhere
there
nothing
unusual
or
interesting
about
it
except
to
the
people
concerned
twenty
five
years
ago
when
was
thirty
eight
and
candace
was
eighteen
she
had
my
child
had
recently
become
partner
in
the
firm
and
it
was
who
took
over
peregrine
westhall
concerns
they
weren
particularly
or
interesting
but
did
visit
often
enough
to
see
what
was
happening
in
that
large
stone
house
in
the
where
the
family
then
lived
the
frail
pretty
wife
who
made
illness
defence
against
her
husband
the
silent
frightened
daughter
the
young
son
think
at
the
time
fancied
myself
as
someone
interested
in
people
sensitive
of
human
emotions
perhaps
was
and
when
say
that
candace
was
frightened
not
suggesting
that
her
father
or
struck
her
he
had
only
one
weapon
and
that
the
his
tongue
doubt
whether
he
ever
touched
her
certainly
not
in
affection
he
was
man
who
disliked
women
candace
was
disappointment
to
him
from
the
moment
of
birth
don
want
to
give
you
the
impression
that
he
was
deliberately
man
knew
him
as
distinguished
academic
wasn
frightened
of
him
could
talk
to
him
candace
never
could
he
would
have
respected
her
if
only
she
stood
up
to
him
he
hated
and
of
course
it
would
have
helped
if
she
been
pretty
doesn
it
always
with
daughters
dalgliesh
said
it
difficult
to
stand
up
to
someone
if
you
ve
been
frightened
of
them
since
early
childhood
without
apparently
hearing
the
comment
went
on
our
relationship
and
am
not
talking
of
love
affair
began
when
was
in
in
oxford
and
saw
candace
she
had
come
up
in
the
term
she
seemed
anxious
to
chat
which
was
unusual
and
invited
her
to
have
coffee
with
me
without
her
father
she
seemed
to
come
alive
she
talked
and
listened
we
agreed
to
meet
again
and
it
became
something
of
habit
for
me
to
drive
to
oxford
when
she
was
there
and
take
her
for
lunch
outside
the
city
we
were
both
and
looked
forward
to
those
meetings
and
our
into
the
we
only
had
sex
once
on
an
warm
afternoon
lying
in
the
wood
under
of
trees
when
suppose
of
beauty
and
the
of
the
trees
the
warmth
our
after
what
had
been
good
lunch
led
to
the
first
kiss
and
from
that
to
the
inevitable
think
afterwards
we
both
knew
it
was
mistake
and
we
were
enough
about
ourselves
to
know
how
it
had
happened
she
had
bad
week
at
college
and
was
in
need
of
comfort
and
the
power
to
comfort
is
and
don
mean
merely
physically
she
was
feeling
inadequate
from
her
and
whether
she
realised
it
or
not
was
looking
for
an
opportunity
to
lose
her
was
older
kind
fond
of
her
available
the
partner
for
first
sexual
experience
which
she
both
wanted
and
feared
she
could
feel
safe
with
me
and
when
too
late
for
an
she
told
me
about
the
pregnancy
we
both
knew
that
her
family
must
never
be
told
particularly
her
father
she
said
that
he
despised
her
and
would
her
more
not
for
the
sex
itself
which
probably
wouldn
worry
him
but
because
it
had
been
with
the
wrong
person
and
she
had
been
fool
in
getting
pregnant
she
could
tell
me
exactly
what
he
would
say
and
it
and
horrified
me
was
approaching
middle
age
and
had
no
wish
to
take
responsibility
for
child
see
now
when
it
is
too
late
to
put
anything
right
that
we
treated
the
baby
as
if
she
was
some
kind
of
which
had
to
be
cut
out
or
at
any
got
rid
of
and
then
could
be
forgotten
if
we
re
thinking
in
terms
of
and
you
so
ve
heard
are
the
son
of
priest
and
no
doubt
family
influence
still
means
something
then
that
was
our
she
kept
the
pregnancy
secret
and
when
there
was
risk
of
discovery
she
went
then
came
back
and
had
the
baby
in
london
nursing
home
it
wasn
difficult
for
me
to
arrange
for
private
followed
by
was
lawyer
had
the
knowledge
and
the
money
and
things
were
less
controlled
in
those
days
candace
was
throughout
if
she
loved
her
child
she
managed
to
it
candace
and
didn
see
each
other
after
the
suppose
there
was
no
true
relationship
on
which
we
could
and
even
to
meet
was
to
invite
embarrassment
shame
the
memory
of
inconvenience
of
lies
told
later
she
made
up
her
time
at
oxford
suppose
she
read
in
an
attempt
to
win
her
father
love
all
know
is
that
she
didn
she
didn
see
again
even
her
name
was
chosen
by
the
foster
parents
until
she
was
eighteen
but
think
she
must
have
kept
in
touch
however
and
without
ever
that
the
child
was
hers
she
obviously
discovered
to
which
university
had
gained
admission
and
took
job
there
although
it
wasn
natural
choice
for
and
one
with
dalgliesh
asked
did
you
see
candace
again
once
only
and
for
the
first
time
after
twenty
five
years
it
was
also
the
last
on
friday
the
of
december
she
came
back
from
visiting
the
old
nurse
grace
in
mrs
is
the
only
witness
to
peregrine
will
candace
went
out
to
pay
her
sum
of
money
think
she
said
ten
thousand
pounds
to
thank
her
for
the
help
she
gave
in
nursing
peregrine
westhall
the
other
witness
was
retired
member
of
the
westhall
household
and
had
been
receiving
small
which
of
course
ended
with
her
death
candace
felt
that
grace
shouldn
go
she
was
also
anxious
to
have
the
nurse
evidence
about
the
date
of
her
father
death
she
told
me
about
robin
boyton
ludicrous
that
the
dead
body
was
concealed
in
freezer
until
twenty
eight
days
after
the
grandfather
death
had
here
is
the
letter
grace
wrote
and
gave
to
her
it
is
as
you
see
addressed
to
candace
she
wanted
me
to
have
copy
perhaps
as
insurance
if
necessary
would
pass
it
on
to
the
head
of
the
firm
he
lifted
the
copy
of
the
will
and
took
from
beneath
it
sheet
of
writing
paper
which
he
passed
to
dalgliesh
the
letter
was
dated
wednesday
december
the
writing
was
large
the
letters
round
and
carefully
formed
dear
sir
miss
candace
westhall
has
asked
me
to
send
you
letter
the
date
of
the
death
of
her
father
dr
peregrine
westhall
this
occurred
on
march
he
had
been
getting
much
worse
during
the
two
days
and
dr
saw
him
on
march
but
did
not
any
fresh
professor
westhall
said
that
he
wanted
to
see
the
local
the
and
he
came
at
once
he
was
driven
by
his
sister
was
in
the
house
at
the
time
but
not
in
the
could
hear
the
professor
shouting
but
not
what
mr
was
saying
they
did
not
stay
very
long
and
the
looked
when
they
left
dr
westhall
died
two
days
later
and
was
in
the
house
with
his
son
and
miss
westhall
when
he
passed
away
was
the
one
who
laid
him
out
also
his
last
will
which
was
in
his
own
handwriting
this
was
some
time
in
the
summer
of
but
don
remember
the
date
this
was
the
last
will
although
professor
westhall
did
make
others
during
the
weeks
which
and
but
which
believe
he
up
all
have
written
is
true
yours
grace
dalgliesh
said
she
was
asked
to
confirm
the
date
of
his
death
so
why
wonder
the
paragraph
to
the
will
since
boyton
had
raised
about
the
date
his
uncle
died
perhaps
she
thought
it
important
to
mention
anything
concerned
with
peregrine
death
which
might
later
be
questioned
but
the
will
never
was
questioned
was
it
and
why
should
candace
westhall
feel
it
necessary
to
fly
to
toronto
and
see
grace
in
person
the
financial
didn
need
visit
and
the
other
information
about
the
date
of
death
could
be
given
by
telephone
and
why
did
she
need
it
she
knew
that
the
had
seen
her
father
two
days
before
he
died
the
evidence
of
and
his
sister
would
be
enough
you
re
suggesting
that
the
ten
thousand
pounds
was
for
this
letter
dalgliesh
said
for
the
last
paragraph
in
the
letter
think
it
possible
that
candace
westhall
wanted
to
ensure
that
there
would
be
no
risk
of
disclosure
from
the
only
living
witness
to
her
father
will
grace
had
helped
nurse
peregrine
westhall
and
knew
what
his
daughter
had
endured
at
his
hands
think
she
would
be
happy
to
see
justice
done
in
the
end
to
candace
and
marcus
and
of
course
she
did
take
the
ten
thousand
pounds
and
what
was
she
asked
to
do
merely
to
say
she
had
will
and
couldn
remember
on
what
date
do
you
think
for
moment
that
she
will
ever
be
persuaded
to
change
her
story
to
say
more
than
that
and
she
didn
witness
the
previous
will
she
would
know
nothing
about
the
to
robin
boyton
she
could
probably
herself
that
she
was
speaking
the
truth
for
nearly
minute
they
sat
in
silence
then
dalgliesh
said
if
asked
you
whether
candace
westhall
on
that
last
visit
to
you
discussed
the
truth
about
her
father
will
would
you
answer
me
no
and
don
suppose
you
expect
me
to
that
why
you
won
ask
but
can
tell
you
this
commander
she
was
not
woman
to
burden
me
with
more
than
needed
to
know
she
wanted
me
to
have
grace
letter
but
that
was
the
least
important
part
of
the
visit
she
told
me
that
our
daughter
had
died
and
how
we
had
unfinished
business
there
were
things
both
of
us
needed
to
say
would
like
to
think
that
when
she
left
me
much
of
the
of
the
last
twenty
five
years
had
away
but
that
would
be
we
had
done
each
other
too
much
damage
think
she
died
happier
because
she
knew
she
could
trust
me
that
was
all
there
was
between
us
and
all
there
had
ever
been
not
love
but
trust
but
dalgliesh
had
one
last
question
he
asked
when
telephoned
and
you
agreed
to
meet
me
did
you
tell
candace
westhall
that
was
coming
looked
him
in
the
face
and
said
quickly
telephoned
and
told
her
and
now
if
you
ll
excuse
me
need
to
rest
glad
you
came
but
we
won
see
each
other
again
if
you
be
good
enough
to
press
that
bell
by
the
bed
charles
will
you
to
the
front
door
he
held
out
his
hand
the
grasp
was
still
firm
but
the
blaze
in
the
eyes
had
died
something
had
been
shut
down
with
charles
waiting
for
him
at
the
open
door
dalgliesh
turned
to
take
last
look
at
he
was
sitting
in
his
chair
staring
in
silence
at
the
empty
grate
dalgliesh
had
hardly
on
his
when
his
mobile
rang
it
was
detective
inspector
andy
howard
the
note
of
triumph
in
his
voice
was
but
unmistakable
we
ve
got
him
sir
local
as
we
suspected
been
questioned
four
times
previously
about
sex
but
never
the
justice
department
will
be
relieved
that
it
not
another
or
someone
released
on
and
of
course
we
ve
got
his
bit
worried
about
the
way
in
which
we
keep
the
if
there
no
charge
but
this
isn
the
first
case
in
which
it
been
useful
inspector
do
you
know
if
there
chance
he
may
guilty
it
would
be
good
to
spare
the
ordeal
of
trial
every
chance
say
sir
the
isn
the
only
evidence
we
ve
got
but
it
and
it
ll
be
quite
time
before
that
is
fit
to
stand
in
any
witness
box
it
was
with
lighter
heart
that
dalgliesh
shut
his
mobile
and
now
he
needed
to
find
place
where
he
could
sit
for
time
alone
and
in
peace
he
drove
from
bournemouth
until
taking
the
road
he
found
place
where
he
could
stop
the
car
and
look
out
to
sea
over
in
the
last
week
his
mind
and
had
been
occupied
only
with
the
deaths
of
rhoda
gradwyn
and
robin
boyton
but
now
there
was
his
future
to
face
choices
had
been
placed
before
him
most
of
them
demanding
or
interesting
but
until
now
he
had
given
them
little
thought
only
one
life
changing
thing
was
certain
his
marriage
to
emma
and
about
that
there
was
no
doubt
nothing
but
the
of
and
at
last
he
knew
the
truth
about
those
two
deaths
perhaps
had
been
right
there
was
an
arrogance
in
wanting
always
to
know
the
truth
particularly
the
truth
about
human
the
mysterious
working
of
another
mind
he
was
convinced
that
candace
westhall
had
never
intended
to
murder
sharon
she
must
have
the
girl
in
her
fantasy
perhaps
when
they
were
alone
and
sharon
was
helping
with
the
books
but
what
candace
had
wanted
and
planned
for
was
the
one
sure
way
of
the
world
that
she
and
she
alone
had
killed
gradwyn
and
boyton
given
her
the
coroner
was
inevitable
the
case
would
be
closed
and
his
over
there
was
nothing
further
he
could
do
or
wanted
to
do
like
every
investigation
this
one
would
leave
him
with
memories
people
who
would
without
any
particular
wish
on
his
part
themselves
as
silent
in
his
mind
and
thoughts
for
years
but
who
could
be
brought
to
life
by
place
stranger
face
voice
he
had
no
wish
regularly
to
the
past
but
these
brief
left
him
curious
to
know
why
particular
people
were
in
his
memory
and
what
their
lives
had
become
they
were
seldom
the
most
important
part
of
the
and
he
thought
he
knew
which
people
from
the
past
week
would
remain
in
memory
father
and
his
fair
haired
of
children
and
lettie
frensham
during
the
past
years
how
many
lives
had
briefly
affected
his
often
in
horror
and
tragedy
in
terror
and
without
knowing
it
they
had
some
of
his
best
what
would
he
find
in
or
the
of
office
but
it
was
time
to
get
back
to
the
old
police
cottage
to
collect
his
bags
and
to
be
on
his
way
he
had
said
his
to
everyone
at
the
manor
and
had
called
at
wisteria
house
to
thank
the
for
their
to
his
team
there
was
only
one
person
now
whom
he
longed
to
see
arriving
at
the
cottage
he
opened
the
door
the
fire
had
been
but
the
room
was
in
darkness
except
for
one
lamp
on
table
beside
the
chair
emma
got
up
and
came
towards
him
her
face
and
dark
hair
by
the
she
said
you
ve
heard
the
news
inspector
howard
has
made
an
arrest
we
don
have
to
picture
him
out
there
somewhere
perhaps
doing
it
again
and
is
going
to
get
better
dalgliesh
said
andy
howard
rang
me
my
darling
it
wonderful
news
especially
about
moving
into
his
arms
she
said
benton
and
kate
met
me
at
wareham
before
they
left
for
london
thought
you
might
like
company
on
the
drive
home
book
five
spring
dorset
cambridge
on
the
first
official
day
of
spring
george
chandler
powell
and
helena
cressett
sat
side
by
side
at
the
office
desk
for
three
hours
they
had
studied
and
discussed
of
figures
and
plans
and
now
as
if
by
silent
agreement
both
stretched
out
hand
to
off
the
computer
leaning
back
in
his
chair
chandler
powell
said
so
it
possible
of
course
it
on
my
keeping
well
and
the
list
of
private
patients
at
st
angela
the
income
from
the
restaurant
won
even
maintain
the
garden
not
at
first
anyway
helena
was
folding
the
plans
away
she
said
we
ve
been
over
the
st
angela
income
even
with
your
present
sessions
you
ve
achieved
two
of
the
figures
in
our
over
the
past
three
years
agreed
the
is
more
expensive
than
you
planned
but
the
has
done
good
job
and
it
should
come
in
slightly
below
cost
with
your
far
east
doing
well
you
could
cover
the
cost
from
the
or
take
bank
do
we
have
to
mention
the
restaurant
on
the
gate
not
necessarily
but
we
must
have
notice
somewhere
with
the
times
of
opening
you
can
be
too
george
you
re
either
running
or
you
re
not
chandler
powell
said
dean
and
kimberley
bostock
seem
happy
about
it
all
but
there
has
to
be
limit
to
what
they
can
do
helena
said
that
why
we
ve
allowed
for
part
time
and
an
extra
cook
after
the
restaurant
gets
established
and
with
no
patients
and
they
ve
always
been
demanding
at
the
manor
they
ll
only
be
for
you
when
you
re
here
the
resident
staff
and
me
dean
is
what
we
re
planning
is
first
class
restaurant
not
one
that
will
attract
customers
from
the
of
the
county
and
beyond
dean
is
fine
you
re
not
going
to
keep
him
if
you
can
offer
him
for
his
skill
with
kimberley
happily
pregnant
and
dean
helping
me
to
plan
restaurant
he
can
feel
is
his
own
ve
never
known
him
so
happy
or
so
settled
and
the
child
will
be
no
problem
the
manor
needs
child
chandler
powell
got
up
and
stretched
his
arms
above
his
head
he
said
let
walk
down
to
the
stones
it
too
good
day
to
sit
at
desk
in
silence
they
put
on
their
and
left
by
the
west
door
the
operating
suite
had
already
been
and
the
last
of
the
medical
equipment
removed
helena
said
you
ll
need
to
give
thought
to
what
you
want
done
with
the
west
wing
we
ll
leave
the
suites
as
they
are
if
we
need
additional
staff
they
ll
come
in
useful
but
you
re
glad
the
clinic
gone
aren
you
you
never
of
it
did
make
it
so
obvious
sorry
but
it
was
always
an
it
didn
belong
here
and
in
hundred
years
it
will
be
forgotten
doubt
that
it
will
be
part
of
the
history
of
the
manor
and
don
think
anyone
will
ever
forget
your
last
private
patient
he
said
candace
me
about
her
she
never
wanted
her
here
and
if
had
operated
on
her
in
london
she
wouldn
have
died
and
all
our
lives
would
be
different
she
said
different
but
not
necessarily
better
did
you
believe
candace
the
first
part
killing
rhoda
yes
did
murder
or
believe
she
did
lose
her
temper
but
she
wasn
threatened
or
think
would
return
of
murder
she
said
if
the
case
ever
came
to
court
commander
dalgliesh
hadn
even
enough
evidence
to
make
an
arrest
think
he
was
close
to
it
then
he
was
taking
risk
what
evidence
had
he
there
were
no
any
one
of
us
could
have
done
it
without
the
attack
on
sharon
and
candace
the
case
would
never
have
been
that
is
of
course
if
it
has
been
helena
said
you
think
she
could
be
lying
to
someone
else
no
that
ludicrous
and
who
would
she
do
it
for
except
her
brother
no
she
killed
rhoda
gradwyn
and
think
she
intended
to
murder
robin
boyton
too
she
admitted
as
much
but
why
what
did
he
really
know
or
guess
that
made
him
so
dangerous
and
before
she
attacked
sharon
was
she
really
in
any
danger
if
she
were
accused
of
gradwyn
and
boyton
any
competent
lawyer
could
that
there
was
reasonable
doubt
it
was
the
attack
on
sharon
that
proved
her
guilt
so
why
did
she
do
it
she
says
it
was
because
sharon
had
seen
her
leaving
the
manor
on
that
friday
night
but
why
not
lie
about
that
who
would
believe
sharon
story
if
candace
it
and
that
attack
on
sharon
how
could
she
hope
to
get
away
with
it
george
said
think
candace
had
had
enough
she
wanted
an
end
an
end
to
what
to
continued
suspicion
and
to
the
risk
that
someone
might
believe
her
brother
was
responsible
to
clear
the
rest
of
us
that
seems
unlikely
an
end
to
herself
don
think
she
found
her
world
worth
living
in
helena
said
we
all
feel
that
at
times
but
it
it
isn
real
we
know
it
isn
real
have
to
be
in
constant
pain
my
mind
my
gone
my
job
gone
this
place
lost
to
me
before
felt
that
think
her
mind
was
think
she
knew
she
was
mad
let
go
to
the
stone
circle
she
dead
and
now
all
feel
is
pity
for
her
suddenly
his
voice
was
pity
don
feel
pity
she
killed
my
patient
did
good
job
on
that
scar
she
looked
at
him
then
turned
away
but
he
had
caught
in
that
fleeting
glance
something
close
to
mixture
of
surprise
and
amused
understanding
she
said
the
last
private
patient
here
at
the
manor
well
she
was
that
all
right
she
was
private
what
did
any
of
us
know
about
her
what
did
you
he
said
quietly
only
that
she
wanted
scar
removed
because
she
no
longer
had
need
of
it
they
began
slowly
pacing
side
by
side
down
the
lime
avenue
the
were
open
and
the
trees
still
showed
the
first
green
of
spring
chandler
powell
said
the
plans
for
the
restaurant
of
course
everything
on
your
being
willing
to
stay
on
you
ll
need
someone
to
take
charge
administrator
general
housekeeper
secretary
essentially
the
job
won
change
could
certainly
stay
on
until
you
find
the
right
person
they
walked
on
in
silence
then
without
stopping
he
said
was
thinking
of
something
more
more
demanding
suppose
you
may
say
less
attractive
at
least
for
you
for
me
it
been
something
too
important
to
risk
disappointment
that
why
haven
spoken
before
asking
you
to
marry
me
believe
we
could
be
happy
together
you
haven
spoken
the
word
love
that
honest
of
you
suppose
it
because
ve
never
really
understood
what
it
means
thought
was
in
love
with
when
married
her
it
was
kind
of
like
you
respect
and
you
we
ve
worked
together
now
for
six
years
want
to
make
love
to
you
but
then
any
man
would
feel
that
never
bored
or
irritated
when
we
re
together
we
share
the
same
passion
for
the
house
and
when
return
here
and
you
re
not
about
feel
an
unease
which
is
difficult
to
explain
it
sense
that
there
something
something
missing
in
the
house
no
in
myself
again
there
was
silence
then
he
asked
can
you
call
that
love
is
it
enough
it
is
for
me
is
it
for
you
do
you
want
time
to
think
about
it
and
now
she
turned
to
him
asking
for
time
would
be
it
is
enough
he
didn
touch
her
he
felt
like
man
but
one
who
was
standing
on
delicate
ground
he
mustn
be
she
would
him
if
he
did
the
obvious
thing
the
thing
he
wanted
to
do
to
take
her
into
his
arms
they
stood
facing
each
other
then
he
said
quietly
thank
you
they
had
reached
the
stones
now
she
said
when
was
child
we
used
to
round
the
circle
and
gently
kick
each
stone
it
was
for
luck
then
perhaps
we
should
do
it
now
they
walked
round
together
he
gently
struck
each
stone
in
turn
returning
to
the
lime
walk
he
said
what
about
lettie
do
you
want
her
to
stay
on
if
she
willing
frankly
it
would
be
difficult
at
first
to
do
without
her
but
she
won
want
to
live
in
the
manor
once
we
re
married
and
it
wouldn
suit
us
we
could
offer
her
stone
cottage
once
it
been
cleared
and
of
course
she
enjoy
having
hand
in
that
and
she
take
pleasure
in
doing
something
with
the
garden
chandler
powell
said
we
could
offer
to
give
her
the
cottage
mean
make
it
over
to
her
with
its
reputation
it
won
otherwise
be
easy
to
sell
that
way
she
ll
have
some
security
for
her
old
age
who
else
would
want
it
would
she
it
seems
to
smell
of
murder
death
helena
said
lettie
has
her
against
those
things
think
she
be
content
in
stone
cottage
but
she
wouldn
want
it
as
gift
sure
she
prefer
to
buy
could
she
afford
to
think
so
she
always
been
and
it
would
be
cheap
after
all
as
you
ve
said
with
its
history
stone
cottage
is
hardly
anyway
could
try
her
if
she
into
the
cottage
she
ll
need
an
in
salary
won
that
be
difficulty
helena
smiled
you
re
forgetting
that
have
money
after
all
we
ve
agreed
that
the
restaurant
will
be
my
may
have
been
an
bastard
but
he
wasn
mean
bastard
so
that
problem
was
settled
chandler
powell
thought
that
this
would
probably
be
the
pattern
of
his
married
life
difficulty
acknowledged
reasonable
solution
proposed
no
particular
action
necessary
on
his
part
he
said
easily
as
we
can
very
well
do
without
her
at
least
at
first
that
all
seems
sensible
it
who
can
do
without
her
haven
you
noticed
she
my
moral
they
walked
on
chandler
powell
could
see
now
that
much
of
his
life
was
going
to
be
planned
for
him
the
thought
caused
him
no
and
much
satisfaction
he
would
have
to
work
hard
to
keep
both
the
london
flat
and
the
manor
but
he
had
always
worked
hard
work
was
his
life
he
wasn
entirely
sure
about
the
restaurant
but
it
was
time
that
something
was
done
to
the
and
the
restaurant
customers
wouldn
need
to
enter
the
manor
and
it
was
important
to
keep
dean
and
kimberley
helena
knew
what
she
was
doing
she
said
have
you
heard
anything
about
sharon
where
she
is
what
job
they
ve
found
for
her
nothing
she
came
out
of
and
went
back
to
she
isn
my
responsibility
thank
god
and
marcus
had
letter
yesterday
he
seems
to
be
settling
down
well
in
africa
it
probably
the
best
place
for
him
he
couldn
hope
to
recover
from
candace
suicide
while
working
here
if
she
wanted
to
separate
us
she
certainly
went
about
it
the
right
way
but
he
spoke
without
rancour
almost
without
interest
after
the
inquest
they
had
rarely
talked
about
candace
suicide
and
always
with
unease
why
she
wondered
had
he
chosen
this
moment
this
walk
together
to
the
painful
past
was
it
his
way
of
making
some
kind
of
formal
of
saying
that
it
was
now
time
for
the
talking
and
speculation
to
stop
and
flavia
is
she
like
sharon
out
of
your
mind
no
we
ve
been
in
touch
she
getting
married
so
soon
someone
she
on
the
internet
she
that
he
solicitor
three
years
ago
with
daughter
aged
two
about
forty
lonely
looking
for
wife
who
children
she
says
she
very
happy
at
least
she
getting
what
she
wanted
it
shows
considerable
wisdom
to
know
what
you
want
in
life
and
then
to
direct
all
your
towards
getting
it
they
had
left
the
avenue
now
and
were
re
entering
the
west
door
glancing
at
her
he
caught
her
secret
smile
she
said
yes
she
was
very
wise
that
how
ve
always
acted
myself
helena
had
broken
the
news
to
lettie
in
the
library
she
said
you
don
you
have
no
right
to
only
the
right
to
be
for
you
you
don
love
him
perhaps
not
now
not
yet
totally
but
it
will
come
all
are
process
of
falling
in
or
out
of
love
don
worry
we
shall
suit
each
other
very
well
in
bed
and
out
and
this
marriage
will
last
and
the
cressett
will
be
raised
again
over
the
manor
and
in
time
child
of
yours
will
choose
to
live
here
dear
lettie
how
well
you
understand
me
and
now
lettie
was
alone
thinking
over
the
offer
that
helena
had
made
to
her
before
they
parted
pacing
through
the
gardens
but
seeing
nothing
and
now
at
last
as
so
often
happened
walking
slowly
down
the
lime
walk
to
the
stones
looking
back
at
the
windows
of
the
west
wing
her
mind
turned
to
that
private
patient
whose
murder
had
changed
the
lives
of
all
who
innocent
or
guilty
had
been
touched
by
it
but
wasn
that
what
violence
always
did
whatever
that
scar
had
meant
to
rhoda
gradwyn
an
her
personal
me
defiance
she
had
for
some
reason
which
no
one
at
the
manor
knew
or
would
ever
know
found
the
will
to
get
rid
of
it
and
change
the
course
of
her
life
she
had
been
of
that
hope
it
was
the
lives
of
others
that
would
be
changed
rhoda
gradwyn
had
been
young
of
course
younger
than
she
lettie
who
at
sixty
knew
that
she
looked
older
but
she
might
have
twenty
relatively
years
ahead
was
it
time
to
settle
for
the
safety
and
comfort
of
the
manor
she
contemplated
what
that
life
would
be
cottage
she
could
call
her
own
decorated
as
she
chose
garden
that
she
could
make
and
useful
job
that
she
could
do
without
strain
with
people
she
respected
her
books
and
music
the
library
at
the
manor
available
to
her
daily
to
breathe
english
air
in
one
of
the
of
perhaps
the
pleasure
of
seeing
child
of
helena
growing
up
and
what
of
the
future
twenty
years
perhaps
of
useful
and
relatively
independent
life
before
she
began
to
become
in
her
eyes
and
perhaps
in
helena
but
they
would
be
good
years
she
knew
that
already
she
had
become
used
to
the
wider
world
beyond
the
manor
as
essentially
and
alien
an
england
she
could
no
longer
the
earth
itself
dying
where
of
people
were
constantly
moving
like
black
of
human
consuming
the
air
of
once
and
beautiful
places
now
with
human
breath
but
it
was
still
her
world
the
one
she
had
been
born
into
she
was
part
of
its
as
she
was
part
of
its
and
its
how
much
of
it
had
she
ever
experienced
in
those
years
of
living
behind
the
walls
of
the
girls
school
at
which
she
had
taught
how
many
people
had
she
really
with
other
than
her
own
kind
her
own
class
people
who
shared
her
own
and
who
spoke
the
same
language
but
it
wasn
too
late
different
world
different
faces
different
voices
were
out
there
to
be
discovered
there
were
still
places
rarely
visited
not
by
of
pounding
feet
which
were
at
peace
in
those
quiet
hours
before
the
first
light
and
the
visitors
out
of
their
she
would
travel
by
train
bus
and
on
foot
leaving
the
of
she
had
saved
enough
to
spend
three
years
away
and
still
have
enough
to
buy
cottage
somewhere
in
england
and
she
was
strong
and
well
in
africa
and
south
there
could
be
useful
work
for
her
for
years
travelling
with
colleague
she
had
had
to
journey
in
the
school
holidays
the
worst
and
time
this
journey
taken
on
her
own
would
be
different
she
would
have
called
it
of
self
discovery
but
rejected
the
words
as
more
than
true
after
sixty
years
she
knew
who
and
what
she
was
this
would
be
not
of
self
but
of
change
finally
she
turned
at
the
stones
and
walked
briskly
back
to
the
manor
helena
said
sorry
but
you
know
best
you
always
did
but
if
need
you
lettie
said
quietly
you
won
none
of
the
usual
need
saying
between
us
but
ll
miss
you
and
the
manor
will
still
be
here
if
you
get
tired
of
wandering
you
can
always
come
home
but
the
words
genuine
as
they
knew
them
to
be
were
lettie
saw
that
helena
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
where
the
morning
sunlight
was
moving
over
the
stone
like
golden
already
she
was
planning
how
the
could
be
carried
out
seeing
in
imagination
the
guests
arriving
consulting
with
dean
over
the
the
possibility
of
star
perhaps
two
the
restaurant
well
in
profit
and
dean
for
ever
at
the
manor
to
george
content
standing
there
happily
looking
to
the
future
in
cambridge
the
wedding
service
was
over
and
the
guests
were
beginning
to
move
into
the
and
stayed
seated
listening
to
the
the
and
had
been
played
and
now
the
himself
and
the
with
on
before
the
service
waiting
in
the
sunshine
with
small
group
of
other
early
people
had
introduced
themselves
including
girl
in
summer
dress
with
short
light
brown
hair
an
attractive
and
intelligent
face
she
had
come
forward
smiling
to
say
that
she
was
kate
miskin
member
of
mr
dalgliesh
squad
and
to
the
young
man
with
her
and
handsome
