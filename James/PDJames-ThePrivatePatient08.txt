the
car
we
may
have
to
leave
in
hurry
thank
you
for
seeing
us
and
for
your
help
in
the
car
their
dalgliesh
opened
the
paper
and
passed
it
to
kate
father
had
drawn
little
with
pointing
to
the
school
she
knew
why
dalgliesh
had
decided
not
to
walk
whatever
the
coming
interview
revealed
it
would
be
not
to
return
and
risk
questions
from
father
after
moment
silence
dalgliesh
mood
she
asked
knowing
that
he
would
understand
do
you
think
this
is
going
to
be
bad
sir
she
meant
bad
for
not
for
them
yes
kate
think
it
may
be
they
had
turned
into
the
noise
and
heavy
traffic
of
way
the
journey
wasn
easy
and
kate
didn
speak
except
to
give
dalgliesh
directions
until
he
had
taken
right
turn
at
the
second
set
of
traffic
lights
and
they
found
themselves
in
road
sir
do
you
think
that
father
will
have
phoned
to
say
we
re
on
our
way
yes
he
an
intelligent
man
by
the
time
we
left
he
ll
have
put
several
facts
together
the
involvement
of
the
met
our
rank
why
commander
and
detective
inspector
if
this
is
routine
enquiry
the
early
return
of
his
car
and
his
friend
silence
but
he
obviously
doesn
know
yet
about
the
murder
he
will
when
he
tomorrow
or
to
the
news
even
then
doubt
whether
he
ll
be
but
he
knows
that
his
friend
may
be
in
trouble
that
why
he
was
determined
to
get
in
all
that
information
about
how
he
transformed
the
school
it
was
an
impressive
kate
before
the
next
question
she
knew
that
dalgliesh
respected
her
and
thought
that
he
was
fond
of
her
over
the
years
she
had
learnt
to
her
emotions
but
though
the
core
of
what
she
had
always
known
was
hopeless
love
remained
and
always
would
it
didn
give
her
the
of
his
mind
there
were
questions
better
not
asked
but
was
this
one
after
silence
in
which
she
kept
her
eyes
on
father
instructions
she
said
you
knew
he
his
friend
but
you
didn
tell
him
not
to
he
ll
have
bad
five
minutes
of
struggle
without
me
making
it
worse
for
him
our
man
isn
going
to
run
away
another
turn
father
had
been
in
the
school
as
quite
close
or
was
it
the
her
or
the
apprehension
about
the
coming
interview
which
made
the
journey
seem
long
now
someone
had
painted
in
of
black
the
is
in
the
internet
beneath
it
more
precisely
written
there
is
no
and
no
god
then
the
next
this
time
in
red
god
lives
see
book
of
job
this
led
to
the
final
fuck
off
dalgliesh
said
not
ending
to
but
rarely
so
expressed
think
this
must
be
the
school
she
saw
victorian
building
of
patterned
brick
faced
with
stone
standing
back
in
large
by
tall
to
her
surprise
the
gate
to
the
was
unlocked
smaller
and
more
of
the
main
building
obviously
by
the
same
was
to
it
by
looking
corridor
here
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
for
size
by
rows
of
windows
and
four
carved
stone
steps
led
to
an
intimidating
door
which
was
opened
to
their
ring
so
quickly
that
kate
suspected
the
headmaster
had
been
waiting
for
them
she
saw
man
in
early
middle
age
almost
as
tall
as
dalgliesh
wearing
pair
of
old
and
with
patches
of
leather
on
the
he
said
if
you
ll
just
wait
moment
ll
lock
the
gate
there
no
bell
there
so
hoped
you
find
your
way
in
within
minute
he
was
back
with
them
he
waited
while
dalgliesh
showed
his
card
and
introduced
kate
then
said
briefly
ve
been
expecting
you
we
ll
speak
in
my
study
following
him
through
the
furnished
entrance
hall
and
down
the
corridor
kate
was
back
in
her
comprehensive
school
here
was
the
faint
almost
smell
of
paper
bodies
and
cleaning
there
was
no
smell
of
did
teachers
ever
use
it
now
had
largely
given
way
to
computers
even
in
primary
schools
but
gazing
through
the
few
open
doors
she
saw
no
perhaps
the
formal
headmaster
house
was
now
largely
to
his
study
and
to
rooms
or
administration
it
was
obvious
that
he
didn
live
on
the
he
stood
aside
to
let
them
enter
room
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
it
was
mixture
of
room
study
and
sitting
room
there
was
rectangular
table
set
in
front
of
the
window
with
six
chairs
almost
to
the
ceiling
on
the
left
hand
wall
and
the
headmaster
desk
with
his
own
chair
and
two
before
it
to
the
right
one
wall
was
covered
with
school
photographs
the
chess
club
row
of
smiling
faces
with
the
board
set
up
in
front
of
them
the
holding
the
small
silver
the
football
and
the
the
cast
of
the
christmas
and
scene
from
what
looked
like
wasn
it
always
short
bloody
not
too
difficult
to
learn
an
open
door
gave
glimpse
of
what
was
obviously
small
kitchen
there
was
smell
of
coffee
pulled
out
two
chairs
at
the
table
and
said
take
it
that
this
is
formal
visit
shall
we
sit
here
he
seated
himself
at
the
top
of
the
table
with
dalgliesh
on
his
right
kate
on
his
left
and
now
she
could
look
at
him
but
more
closely
she
saw
good
face
sensitive
and
firm
face
one
saw
on
television
chosen
to
confidence
in
the
about
the
bank
over
its
or
to
persuade
the
that
that
car
could
among
the
neighbours
he
looked
younger
than
kate
had
expected
perhaps
because
of
the
of
his
weekend
clothes
and
might
she
thought
have
shown
some
of
the
confident
of
youth
if
he
hadn
looked
so
tired
the
grey
eyes
which
briefly
met
hers
and
then
turned
to
dalgliesh
were
with
exhaustion
but
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
surprisingly
dalgliesh
said
we
re
making
enquiries
into
the
suspicious
death
of
woman
at
house
in
stoke
cheverell
in
dorset
focus
with
the
number
plate
was
seen
parked
close
to
the
house
between
eleven
thirty
five
and
eleven
forty
on
the
night
she
died
that
was
last
friday
december
the
we
are
told
that
you
had
the
car
on
that
date
were
you
driving
and
were
you
there
yes
was
there
under
what
circumstances
mr
and
now
roused
himself
speaking
to
dalgliesh
he
said
want
to
make
statement
not
an
official
statement
at
present
although
realise
that
will
have
to
come
want
to
explain
to
you
why
was
there
and
to
do
it
now
just
as
events
come
into
my
mind
without
even
how
they
sound
or
what
the
effect
of
them
might
be
know
you
ll
have
questions
and
ll
try
to
answer
them
but
it
would
be
helpful
if
could
first
just
tell
the
truth
without
was
going
to
say
tell
what
happened
in
my
own
words
but
what
other
words
have
dalgliesh
said
perhaps
that
would
be
the
best
way
to
start
ll
try
not
to
make
it
too
long
the
story
has
become
complicated
but
basically
it
very
simple
won
go
into
details
about
my
early
life
my
parents
my
ll
just
say
that
knew
from
childhood
that
wanted
to
teach
got
to
school
and
later
major
county
to
oxford
read
history
after
my
degree
gained
place
at
london
university
to
take
teacher
training
course
leading
to
in
education
this
took
year
once
decided
to
take
year
off
before
for
job
felt
had
been
breathing
academic
air
for
too
long
and
needed
to
travel
to
experience
something
of
the
world
to
meet
people
from
other
of
life
before
began
sorry
ve
got
ahead
of
myself
we
need
to
return
to
the
time
when
gained
my
place
at
london
university
my
parents
had
always
been
poor
not
poor
but
every
counted
and
any
money
needed
had
to
be
saved
either
from
my
or
from
working
in
the
holidays
so
when
went
to
london
needed
to
find
somewhere
cheap
to
live
the
city
centre
was
obviously
too
expensive
and
had
to
look
further
friend
who
had
gained
place
the
year
before
was
in
park
an
and
suggested
tried
there
it
was
when
was
visiting
him
that
saw
an
advertisement
outside
shop
for
room
suitable
for
student
in
green
only
two
further
on
the
east
london
line
there
was
phone
number
so
rang
and
went
to
the
house
it
was
occupied
by
his
wife
and
their
two
daughters
shirley
who
was
eleven
and
her
younger
sister
aged
eight
their
grandmother
also
lived
in
the
house
there
wasn
really
room
for
the
grandmother
shared
the
largest
bedroom
with
the
two
girls
and
mr
and
mrs
had
the
second
bedroom
at
the
back
had
the
third
and
smallest
bedroom
also
at
the
back
but
it
was
cheap
close
to
the
the
journey
was
quick
and
easy
and
was
desperate
the
first
week
my
worst
fears
the
husband
and
wife
were
on
shouting
terms
the
grandmother
sour
old
woman
was
obviously
that
she
was
basically
and
whenever
we
met
was
full
of
about
her
the
local
council
her
daughter
her
son
in
law
mean
that
she
towards
her
keep
as
was
in
london
most
days
and
often
worked
late
in
the
university
library
avoided
the
worst
of
the
family
within
week
of
my
arrival
after
of
house
shaking
finally
walked
out
could
have
done
the
same
but
what
kept
me
there
was
the
younger
daughter
he
paused
the
silence
lengthened
and
no
one
interrupted
him
he
raised
his
head
to
look
at
dalgliesh
and
kate
could
hardly
bear
to
watch
the
she
saw
he
said
how
can
describe
her
to
you
how
can
make
you
understand
she
was
an
child
she
was
beautiful
but
it
was
more
than
that
she
had
grace
gentleness
fine
began
getting
home
early
so
that
could
study
in
my
room
and
would
join
me
before
she
went
to
bed
she
used
to
knock
on
my
door
and
come
in
to
sit
quietly
and
read
while
was
working
would
bring
home
books
and
when
stopped
writing
to
make
coffee
for
myself
and
milk
drink
for
her
we
would
talk
tried
to
answer
her
questions
we
spoke
about
the
book
she
been
reading
can
see
her
now
her
clothes
looked
as
if
her
mother
had
found
them
in
jumble
sale
long
summer
dresses
in
winter
under
shapeless
cardigan
short
and
if
she
was
cold
she
never
said
so
some
weekends
would
ask
her
mother
if
could
take
her
up
to
london
to
or
gallery
there
was
never
any
problem
she
was
glad
to
have
her
out
of
the
way
particularly
when
she
was
bringing
her
men
home
knew
what
was
going
on
of
course
but
it
wasn
my
responsibility
wouldn
have
stayed
except
for
loved
her
again
there
was
silence
then
he
said
know
what
you
re
going
to
ask
was
this
sexual
relationship
can
only
say
that
even
the
thought
would
have
been
for
me
never
touched
her
in
that
way
but
it
was
love
and
isn
love
always
to
some
physical
not
sexual
but
physical
delight
in
the
beauty
and
grace
of
the
one
who
is
loved
you
see
know
all
the
questions
shall
be
asked
were
any
of
your
actions
inappropriate
how
can
one
answer
that
in
an
age
when
even
to
put
your
arm
round
the
shoulders
of
child
is
regarded
as
inappropriate
no
it
was
never
inappropriate
but
who
is
ever
going
to
believe
me
there
was
silence
after
minute
dalgliesh
asked
at
this
time
was
shirley
now
sharon
bateman
living
in
the
house
yes
she
was
the
older
sister
difficult
child
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
they
were
sisters
she
had
disconcerting
habit
of
staring
at
people
not
speaking
just
looking
an
look
more
adult
than
suppose
should
have
realised
that
she
was
unhappy
well
must
have
realised
it
but
it
wasn
something
felt
could
help
did
once
suggest
to
when
planned
to
take
her
to
london
to
see
abbey
that
shirley
might
like
to
come
too
said
yes
you
ask
her
and
did
can
remember
what
response
got
something
about
not
wanting
to
go
to
boring
london
to
see
the
boring
abbey
with
boring
me
but
know
was
relieved
that
brought
myself
to
ask
and
she
refused
after
that
bother
again
suppose
should
have
realised
what
she
was
feeling
the
the
but
was
twenty
two
and
hadn
the
to
her
pain
or
to
deal
with
it
and
now
kate
she
said
was
it
your
responsibility
to
deal
with
it
you
weren
her
father
if
things
were
going
wrong
in
the
family
it
was
for
them
to
deal
with
the
problems
he
turned
to
her
almost
it
seemed
with
relief
that
what
tell
myself
now
not
sure
believe
it
it
wasn
comfortable
house
for
me
or
for
any
of
them
if
it
hadn
been
for
would
have
looked
because
of
her
stayed
until
the
end
of
my
year
after
as
teacher
decided
to
start
on
the
planned
journey
never
been
except
for
school
trip
to
and
went
first
to
the
obvious
places
and
then
on
to
and
at
first
sent
to
sometimes
two
week
dalgliesh
said
it
never
received
your
cards
we
think
they
were
by
shirley
they
ve
been
found
cut
in
half
and
buried
beside
one
of
the
cheverell
stones
he
didn
explain
what
the
stones
were
but
then
thought
kate
did
he
need
to
after
time
stopped
sending
them
thinking
that
had
either
forgotten
me
or
was
busy
with
her
school
life
that
had
been
an
important
influence
for
time
but
not
lasting
one
and
the
awful
thing
is
this
in
way
was
relieved
had
career
to
out
for
myself
and
perhaps
would
have
been
responsibility
as
well
as
and
was
looking
for
adult
love
aren
we
all
in
our
youth
learnt
of
the
murder
when
was
in
for
moment
was
physically
sick
with
shock
and
horror
and
of
course
for
the
child
had
loved
but
later
when
remembered
that
year
with
it
was
like
dream
and
the
grief
was
an
unfocused
sorrow
for
all
ill
treated
and
murdered
children
and
for
the
death
of
perhaps
that
was
because
now
had
child
didn
write
to
the
mother
or
grandmother
to
never
mentioned
to
anyone
that
had
known
the
family
felt
absolutely
no
responsibility
for
her
death
had
none
did
feel
some
shame
and
regret
that
not
continued
trying
to
keep
in
touch
but
that
passed
even
when
returned
home
the
police
didn
contact
me
to
question
me
why
should
they
shirley
had
confessed
and
the
evidence
was
the
only
explanation
anyone
ever
received
was
that
she
had
killed
because
her
sister
was
too
pretty
there
was
momentary
silence
then
dalgliesh
spoke
when
did
shirley
get
in
touch
with
you
on
the
of
november
received
letter
from
her
apparently
she
had
seen
television
programme
on
education
in
which
had
appeared
she
recognised
me
and
the
name
of
the
school
where
was
working
still
work
the
letter
simply
said
that
she
remembered
me
that
she
still
loved
me
and
she
needed
to
see
me
she
told
me
she
was
working
at
cheverell
manor
and
how
to
find
my
way
there
and
suggested
that
we
meet
the
letter
horrified
me
couldn
imagine
what
she
meant
by
still
me
she
had
never
loved
me
or
shown
the
slightest
sign
of
affection
for
me
nor
to
her
acted
and
burnt
the
letter
and
tried
to
forget
ever
seen
it
it
was
hopeless
of
course
ten
days
later
she
wrote
again
this
time
there
was
threat
she
said
she
had
to
see
me
and
if
didn
come
she
had
found
someone
who
would
tell
the
world
how
had
rejected
her
still
don
know
what
the
proper
response
would
have
been
probably
to
tell
my
wife
even
to
the
police
but
could
make
them
believe
the
truth
about
my
relationship
with
or
with
shirley
decided
that
the
best
plan
at
least
at
first
would
be
to
see
her
and
to
try
to
reason
her
out
of
her
she
had
told
me
to
meet
her
at
parking
place
by
the
side
of
the
road
near
the
cheverell
stones
at
midnight
she
even
sent
little
carefully
drawn
the
letter
ended
it
so
wonderful
to
have
found
you
we
must
never
let
each
other
go
again
dalgliesh
asked
have
you
got
the
letter
no
again
acted
took
it
with
me
on
the
journey
and
when
got
to
the
parking
space
used
the
car
lighter
to
it
suppose
was
in
denial
from
the
moment
her
first
letter
arrived
and
did
you
meet
her
yes
we
met
and
at
the
stones
as
she
had
arranged
didn
touch
her
even
to
shake
hands
nor
did
she
seem
to
expect
that
she
me
suggested
we
return
to
the
car
where
we
would
be
more
comfortable
and
we
sat
side
by
side
she
said
that
even
when
had
been
with
that
was
the
word
she
used
she
had
loved
me
she
had
killed
because
she
was
but
now
she
had
served
her
sentence
that
meant
she
was
free
to
love
me
she
wanted
to
marry
me
and
have
my
children
it
was
all
said
very
calmly
almost
without
emotion
but
with
terrible
will
she
stared
ahead
and
don
think
she
even
looked
at
me
as
she
spoke
explained
as
gently
as
could
that
was
married
that
had
child
and
that
there
could
never
be
anything
between
us
didn
offer
her
even
friendship
how
could
my
only
wish
was
never
to
see
her
again
it
was
bizarre
horror
when
told
her
was
married
she
said
that
stop
us
from
being
together
could
get
divorce
we
would
have
children
together
and
she
would
look
after
the
son
had
he
had
been
looking
down
as
he
spoke
his
hands
clasped
on
the
table
now
he
lifted
his
face
to
dalgliesh
and
he
and
kate
could
see
the
horror
and
desperation
in
his
eyes
to
look
after
my
child
the
thought
of
even
having
her
in
the
house
close
to
my
family
appalled
me
suppose
failed
again
in
imagination
should
have
sensed
her
need
but
all
felt
was
horror
the
compulsion
to
get
away
from
her
to
buy
time
did
that
by
lying
said
would
talk
to
my
wife
but
that
she
mustn
hope
because
there
was
none
did
at
least
make
that
clear
and
then
she
said
goodbye
again
without
touching
me
and
left
sat
watching
as
she
disappeared
into
the
darkness
following
small
of
light
dalgliesh
said
did
you
at
any
time
enter
the
manor
no
did
she
ask
you
to
do
so
no
did
you
while
you
were
parked
see
or
hear
anyone
else
no
one
drove
away
the
minute
shirley
got
out
of
the
car
saw
no
one
that
night
one
of
the
patients
there
was
murdered
did
shirley
say
anything
which
you
to
believe
that
she
might
be
responsible
nothing
the
patient
name
was
rhoda
gradwyn
did
shirley
mention
that
name
to
you
speak
about
her
tell
you
anything
about
the
manor
nothing
except
that
she
worked
there
and
was
this
the
first
time
you
ve
heard
of
the
manor
yes
the
first
time
there
hasn
been
anything
on
the
news
surely
and
certainly
not
in
the
sunday
papers
wouldn
have
missed
it
nothing
yet
but
there
probably
will
be
tomorrow
morning
have
you
spoken
to
your
wife
about
shirley
no
not
yet
think
ve
been
in
denial
hoping
but
without
real
hope
that
might
hear
nothing
more
from
shirley
that
convinced
her
that
we
had
no
future
together
the
whole
incident
was
nightmare
as
you
know
michael
car
for
the
journey
and
decided
that
if
shirley
wrote
again
confide
in
him
had
desperate
need
to
tell
someone
and
knew
that
he
would
be
wise
and
kind
and
sensible
and
at
least
would
me
what
should
do
only
then
would
speak
to
my
wife
realise
of
course
that
if
shirley
did
make
the
past
public
it
could
destroy
my
career
and
now
kate
spoke
again
she
said
but
surely
not
if
the
truth
were
accepted
you
showed
kindness
and
affection
to
an
obviously
lonely
and
child
you
were
only
twenty
two
at
the
time
you
couldn
possibly
know
that
your
friendship
with
would
lead
to
her
death
you
aren
responsible
for
that
death
no
one
is
but
shirley
she
was
lonely
and
too
but
you
weren
responsible
for
her
but
was
responsible
and
without
if
hadn
met
me
she
be
alive
today
kate
voice
was
urgent
would
she
wouldn
there
have
been
another
cause
for
particularly
when
they
became
and
it
was
who
had
the
the
attention
the
love
you
can
possibly
tell
what
might
have
happened
we
can
be
held
responsible
for
the
long
term
of
all
our
actions
she
stopped
her
face
flushed
and
looked
across
at
dalgliesh
he
knew
what
she
was
thinking
she
had
spoken
from
pity
and
outrage
but
in
those
emotions
she
had
acted
no
suspect
in
murder
case
should
be
led
to
believe
that
the
investigating
officers
are
on
his
side
now
dalgliesh
spoke
directly
to
like
you
to
make
statement
setting
out
the
facts
as
you
have
described
them
we
shall
almost
certainly
need
to
talk
again
when
we
have
interviewed
sharon
bateman
so
far
she
has
told
us
nothing
not
even
her
true
and
if
she
has
spent
less
than
four
years
living
in
the
community
after
her
release
from
she
will
still
be
under
please
put
your
private
address
on
the
statement
we
shall
need
to
know
how
to
reach
you
at
home
reaching
for
his
briefcase
he
took
out
an
official
form
and
handed
it
over
said
ll
take
this
over
to
the
desk
the
light
better
there
and
sat
with
his
back
to
them
then
he
turned
and
said
sorry
haven
offered
you
coffee
or
tea
if
inspector
miskin
would
like
to
make
it
everything
necessary
is
next
door
this
may
take
some
time
dalgliesh
said
ll
see
to
it
and
went
into
the
room
leaving
the
door
open
there
was
of
china
the
sound
of
kettle
being
filled
kate
waited
couple
of
minutes
then
went
to
join
him
searching
in
small
for
the
milk
dalgliesh
carried
in
the
tray
with
three
cups
and
and
placed
one
with
the
sugar
bowl
and
milk
beside
who
continued
writing
and
then
without
looking
at
them
stretched
out
hand
and
drew
the
cup
towards
him
he
took
neither
milk
nor
sugar
and
kate
moved
them
over
to
the
table
where
she
and
dalgliesh
sat
in
silence
she
felt
tired
but
resisted
the
temptation
to
back
in
the
chair
thirty
minutes
later
turned
and
handed
the
pages
to
dalgliesh
he
said
it
finished
now
tried
to
keep
it
haven
attempted
any
but
there
is
none
do
you
need
to
watch
me
it
dalgliesh
went
over
and
the
paper
was
signed
he
and
kate
picked
up
their
coats
and
were
ready
to
go
as
if
they
were
parents
who
had
come
to
discuss
the
progress
of
their
children
said
formally
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
to
the
school
ll
see
you
to
the
door
when
you
need
to
speak
to
me
again
no
doubt
you
ll
be
in
touch
he
unlocked
the
front
door
and
went
with
them
to
the
gate
the
last
they
saw
of
him
was
his
pale
taut
face
staring
at
them
from
behind
the
bars
like
man
then
he
closed
the
gate
turned
and
walking
with
firm
steps
to
the
school
door
entered
without
looking
back
in
the
car
dalgliesh
switched
on
the
reading
light
and
took
up
the
he
said
the
best
route
seems
to
be
to
take
the
south
then
the
and
the
you
must
be
hungry
we
both
need
to
eat
and
this
doesn
look
particularly
place
kate
found
herself
desperate
to
get
away
from
the
school
from
the
town
from
the
memory
of
the
last
hour
she
said
couldn
we
stop
somewhere
on
the
motorway
don
mean
for
meal
but
we
could
pick
up
sandwich
the
rain
had
stopped
now
except
for
few
heavy
which
fell
as
oil
on
the
when
they
were
at
last
on
the
motorway
kate
said
sorry
said
what
did
to
mr
know
it
to
with
suspect
she
wanted
to
go
on
but
her
voice
was
and
she
simply
said
again
sorry
sir
dalgliesh
didn
glance
at
her
he
said
you
spoke
out
of
to
feel
strongly
can
be
dangerous
in
murder
investigation
but
not
as
dangerous
as
losing
the
to
feel
it
at
all
no
harm
was
done
but
the
tears
still
came
and
he
let
her
quietly
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
road
the
motorway
before
them
in
of
light
the
of
on
their
right
the
moving
pattern
of
the
traffic
the
out
of
black
hedges
and
trees
by
the
huge
shapes
of
the
roar
and
of
world
of
caught
up
in
the
same
extraordinary
compulsion
when
he
saw
sign
saying
services
dalgliesh
moved
into
the
left
hand
lane
and
then
pulled
off
onto
the
slip
road
he
found
space
on
the
edge
of
the
car
park
and
switched
off
the
engine
they
moved
into
building
with
light
and
colour
every
café
and
shop
was
hung
with
christmas
and
in
corner
small
largely
was
singing
and
for
charity
they
made
their
way
to
the
then
picked
up
sandwiches
and
two
large
plastic
of
coffee
and
returned
with
them
to
the
car
while
they
ate
dalgliesh
phoned
benton
to
put
him
in
the
picture
and
within
twenty
minutes
they
were
on
their
way
glancing
at
kate
face
strained
with
determination
not
to
her
tiredness
he
said
it
been
long
day
and
it
isn
over
yet
why
not
put
the
seat
back
and
have
sleep
all
right
sir
there
no
need
for
both
of
us
to
stay
awake
there
on
the
back
seat
if
you
can
reach
it
ll
wake
you
up
in
good
time
he
resisted
tiredness
when
driving
by
keeping
the
low
if
she
slept
she
would
need
the
she
back
her
seat
and
settled
herself
the
close
to
her
neck
her
face
turned
towards
him
almost
at
once
she
was
asleep
she
slept
so
quietly
that
he
could
hardly
hear
her
gently
drawn
breath
except
that
from
time
to
time
she
made
small
like
sleeping
child
and
deeper
into
the
glancing
at
her
face
all
anxiety
away
by
the
of
life
little
of
death
he
thought
what
good
face
it
was
not
beautiful
certainly
not
pretty
but
good
face
honest
open
pleasant
to
look
at
face
that
would
last
for
years
when
on
case
she
had
worn
her
light
brown
hair
in
single
thick
now
she
had
had
it
cut
and
it
lay
softly
on
her
cheeks
he
knew
that
what
she
needed
from
him
was
more
than
he
could
give
but
what
he
did
give
he
knew
that
she
valued
friendship
trust
respect
and
affection
but
she
deserved
much
more
about
six
months
ago
he
had
thought
that
she
had
found
it
now
he
was
not
so
sure
soon
he
knew
the
special
investigation
squad
would
fold
or
be
absorbed
into
another
department
he
would
make
his
own
decision
about
his
future
kate
would
gain
her
to
detective
chief
inspector
but
what
then
for
her
he
had
sensed
of
late
that
she
was
tired
of
travelling
alone
at
the
next
service
he
pulled
in
and
cut
off
the
engine
she
didn
stir
he
tucked
the
close
round
her
sleeping
body
and
settled
himself
for
short
break
ten
minutes
later
he
slid
back
into
the
stream
of
traffic
and
drove
south
through
the
night
despite
the
exhaustion
and
of
the
previous
day
kate
woke
early
and
on
dalgliesh
and
her
late
return
from
the
team
usual
review
of
progress
had
been
but
brief
an
exchange
of
information
not
discussion
of
its
the
result
of
the
on
rhoda
gradwyn
body
had
been
received
in
the
late
afternoon
dr
glenister
were
always
comprehensive
but
this
was
and
miss
gradwyn
had
been
healthy
woman
with
all
that
implied
of
hope
and
it
had
been
her
two
decisions
to
have
the
scar
removed
and
the
operation
performed
at
cheverell
manor
which
had
led
to
those
seven
stark
words
death
by
caused
by
reading
the
report
with
dalgliesh
and
benton
kate
was
seized
by
the
familiar
surge
of
anger
and
pity
at
the
of
murder
now
she
dressed
quickly
and
found
that
she
was
hungry
for
the
breakfast
of
and
egg
and
served
to
her
and
benton
by
mrs
shepherd
dalgliesh
had
decided
that
she
not
himself
or
benton
should
meet
mrs
at
wareham
the
officer
had
telephoned
late
the
previous
night
to
say
that
she
would
take
the
five
past
eight
train
from
and
hoped
to
arrive
at
wareham
at
ten
thirty
the
train
was
on
time
and
kate
had
no
difficulty
in
mrs
among
the
small
number
of
she
looked
into
kate
eyes
and
shook
hands
with
brief
action
as
if
this
formal
meeting
of
flesh
was
of
some
pre
arranged
she
was
shorter
than
kate
with
square
clear
skinned
face
given
strength
by
the
of
the
mouth
and
chin
her
dark
brown
hair
greying
in
had
been
well
and
as
kate
knew
cut
she
was
without
the
usual
of
briefcase
and
carried
instead
large
linen
bag
with
and
over
her
shoulder
for
kate
everything
about
her
spoke
of
authority
quietly
and
she
reminded
kate
of
one
of
her
mrs
who
had
transformed
the
dreaded
fourth
into
acting
like
comparatively
by
the
simple
of
that
when
she
was
present
they
could
do
no
other
kate
made
the
enquiry
about
the
journey
mrs
said
had
window
seat
with
no
children
or
on
their
the
sandwich
from
the
car
was
fresh
and
enjoyed
the
that
for
me
is
good
journey
they
didn
speak
of
shirley
now
sharon
on
the
drive
although
mrs
asked
about
the
manor
and
the
people
who
worked
there
perhaps
to
put
herself
in
the
picture
kate
guessed
that
she
was
the
until
she
was
with
dalgliesh
there
was
no
point
and
there
might
be
in
saying
things
twice
in
the
old
police
cottage
mrs
welcomed
by
dalgliesh
the
offer
of
coffee
and
asked
for
tea
which
kate
made
benton
had
arrived
and
the
four
of
them
sat
round
the
low
table
in
front
of
the
fire
dalgliesh
who
had
rhoda
gradwyn
file
in
front
of
him
briefly
explained
how
the
team
had
come
to
know
of
sharon
real
he
handed
the
file
to
mrs
who
examined
the
picture
of
battered
face
without
comment
after
few
minutes
she
closed
the
file
and
handed
it
back
to
dalgliesh
she
said
it
would
be
interesting
to
find
out
how
rhoda
gradwyn
managed
to
get
hold
of
some
of
this
material
but
as
she
dead
there
seems
little
point
in
an
enquiry
anyway
that
won
be
for
me
to
do
certainly
we
ve
had
no
of
anything
about
sharon
being
and
there
was
legal
when
she
was
minor
dalgliesh
asked
she
didn
you
of
her
change
of
job
and
address
no
she
should
have
done
of
course
and
should
have
been
in
touch
before
now
with
the
retirement
home
last
met
her
by
ten
months
ago
when
she
was
still
there
she
must
have
already
decided
to
move
her
excuse
will
probably
be
that
she
didn
want
to
tell
me
and
saw
no
need
my
excuse
less
is
the
usual
one
too
heavy
and
the
following
the
of
home
office
in
common
sharon
fell
through
the
net
falling
through
the
net
thought
dalgliesh
would
be
perfect
for
novel
he
said
you
had
no
particular
anxiety
about
her
none
in
the
sense
of
seeing
her
as
public
danger
she
wouldn
have
been
released
if
the
board
hadn
been
satisfied
that
she
wasn
danger
to
herself
or
others
she
was
no
trouble
when
she
was
in
house
and
has
been
none
since
release
if
had
anxiety
indeed
still
have
it
about
finding
and
suitable
job
for
her
helping
her
to
make
life
for
herself
she
has
always
resisted
taking
any
form
of
training
the
job
at
the
retirement
home
wasn
long
term
solution
she
should
be
with
people
of
her
own
age
but
not
here
to
discuss
sharon
future
can
see
that
she
problem
for
your
investigation
wherever
she
goes
we
ll
ensure
she
available
if
you
wish
to
question
her
has
she
been
co
operating
so
far
dalgliesh
said
she
hasn
been
problem
at
present
we
have
no
prime
suspect
well
obviously
she
can
stay
here
ll
make
for
her
to
go
to
until
we
can
arrange
something
more
hope
to
be
able
to
send
someone
for
her
in
three
days
time
of
course
ll
keep
in
touch
kate
asked
has
she
ever
expressed
for
what
she
did
no
and
that
has
been
problem
she
only
that
she
wasn
sorry
at
the
time
and
what
was
the
point
of
being
sorry
afterwards
just
because
you
ve
been
found
out
dalgliesh
said
there
certain
honesty
in
that
shall
we
see
her
now
kate
would
you
find
her
please
and
bring
her
here
they
were
kept
waiting
for
kate
to
return
with
sharon
and
when
after
fifteen
minutes
they
arrived
the
reason
for
the
delay
was
apparent
sharon
had
taken
trouble
over
her
appearance
skirt
and
had
been
for
her
working
her
hair
had
been
brushed
to
and
she
was
wearing
lipstick
there
was
an
immense
in
each
ear
she
came
in
but
with
certain
and
took
seat
opposite
dalgliesh
mrs
took
chair
beside
her
an
kate
thought
of
where
her
professional
concern
and
lay
she
herself
sat
beside
dalgliesh
and
benton
notebook
open
sat
close
to
the
door
on
entering
the
room
sharon
had
shown
no
surprise
at
seeing
mrs
now
her
eyes
on
her
she
said
without
apparent
resentment
thought
you
be
along
sooner
or
later
it
would
have
been
sooner
sharon
if
you
told
me
about
your
change
of
job
and
miss
gradwyn
death
as
of
course
you
should
have
well
was
going
to
but
fat
chance
with
the
all
over
the
house
and
everyone
watching
me
if
they
saw
me
phone
they
ask
why
anyway
she
was
only
killed
on
friday
night
well
here
now
and
there
are
number
of
things
we
need
to
talk
about
in
private
but
first
of
all
commander
dalgliesh
has
some
questions
and
want
you
to
promise
to
answer
them
and
in
full
this
is
important
sharon
dalgliesh
said
you
have
the
right
miss
bateman
to
ask
for
solicitor
to
be
present
if
you
think
it
necessary
she
stared
at
him
why
would
want
solicitor
haven
done
anything
wrong
anyway
mrs
here
she
ll
see
there
no
funny
business
and
told
you
everything
know
when
we
were
in
the
library
on
saturday
dalgliesh
said
not
all
you
didn
say
then
that
you
left
the
manor
on
friday
night
we
now
know
that
you
did
you
went
out
to
meet
someone
at
about
midnight
and
we
know
who
it
was
we
ve
spoken
to
mr
and
now
there
was
change
sharon
started
from
her
chair
then
sat
back
and
clasped
the
edge
of
the
table
her
face
flushed
and
the
mild
eyes
and
seemed
to
kate
to
into
of
anger
you
can
it
on
he
never
killed
that
woman
he
wouldn
kill
anyone
he
good
and
he
kind
and
love
him
we
re
going
to
get
married
mrs
said
her
voice
gentle
that
isn
possible
sharon
and
you
know
it
isn
mr
is
already
married
and
has
child
think
in
asking
him
to
come
back
into
your
life
you
were
acting
out
fantasy
dream
now
we
have
to
face
reality
sharon
looked
at
dalgliesh
who
said
how
did
you
discover
where
mr
was
saw
him
on
tv
didn
was
watching
it
in
my
room
after
dinner
just
turned
it
on
and
saw
him
that
why
kept
on
watching
it
was
boring
programme
about
education
but
saw
and
heard
his
voice
and
he
was
just
the
same
only
older
the
programme
said
how
he
changed
this
school
so
wrote
down
the
name
and
that
where
sent
the
letter
he
never
replied
to
the
first
one
so
sent
another
and
told
him
he
better
meet
me
it
was
important
dalgliesh
said
did
you
make
threats
either
he
met
you
or
you
tell
someone
that
he
with
your
family
and
had
known
both
you
and
your
sister
had
he
either
of
you
he
didn
do
any
harm
to
he
not
one
of
them
if
that
what
you
re
thinking
he
loved
her
they
were
always
reading
together
up
in
his
room
or
going
out
for
she
liked
being
with
him
but
she
didn
care
about
him
she
just
liked
the
and
she
only
went
up
to
his
room
because
that
was
better
than
staying
in
the
kitchen
with
me
and
gran
gran
was
always
picking
on
us
said
she
was
bored
with
but
about
him
loved
him
ve
always
loved
him
never
thought
see
him
again
but
now
he
back
in
my
life
want
to
be
with
him
know
can
make
him
happy
kate
wondered
if
either
dalgliesh
or
mrs
would
mention
murder
neither
did
instead
dalgliesh
asked
so
you
arranged
for
mr
to
meet
you
at
the
parking
space
for
the
stones
want
you
to
tell
me
exactly
what
happened
and
what
passed
between
you
you
said
you
seen
him
he
must
ve
told
you
what
happened
don
see
why
should
have
to
go
over
it
all
again
nothing
happened
he
said
he
was
married
but
he
was
going
to
talk
to
his
wife
and
ask
for
divorce
and
then
went
back
into
the
house
and
he
drove
away
dalgliesh
asked
and
that
was
all
well
we
weren
going
to
sit
in
the
car
all
night
were
we
just
sat
there
beside
him
for
bit
but
we
never
kissed
or
anything
like
that
you
don
have
to
kiss
when
you
re
really
in
love
knew
he
was
speaking
the
truth
knew
he
loved
me
so
after
time
got
out
and
went
back
to
the
house
did
he
go
back
with
you
no
he
didn
why
would
he
knew
my
way
didn
anyway
he
wanted
to
be
off
could
tell
that
did
he
at
any
time
mention
rhoda
gradwyn
of
course
he
didn
why
would
he
talk
about
her
he
never
met
her
did
you
give
him
keys
to
the
manor
and
now
she
was
suddenly
angry
again
no
no
no
he
never
asked
for
the
keys
why
would
he
want
them
he
never
went
near
the
place
you
re
trying
to
murder
on
him
because
you
re
all
the
others
mr
chandler
powell
sister
holland
miss
cressett
all
of
them
you
re
trying
to
it
all
on
and
me
dalgliesh
said
quietly
we
re
not
here
to
this
crime
on
the
innocent
our
job
is
to
find
out
who
guilty
the
innocent
have
nothing
to
fear
but
mr
may
well
be
in
trouble
if
the
story
about
you
known
think
you
understand
what
mean
we
don
live
in
kind
world
and
people
might
very
easily
the
friendship
between
him
and
your
sister
well
she
dead
isn
she
what
can
they
prove
now
mrs
broke
her
silence
she
said
they
can
prove
anything
sharon
but
gossip
and
don
on
truth
think
when
mr
dalgliesh
has
finished
questioning
you
we
better
have
talk
about
your
future
after
this
terrible
experience
you
ve
done
very
well
so
far
sharon
but
think
it
may
be
time
to
move
on
she
turned
to
dalgliesh
could
have
the
use
of
room
here
for
time
if
you
ve
finished
of
course
it
straight
across
the
hall
sharon
said
all
right
sick
of
the
anyway
sick
of
their
questions
sick
of
their
stupid
faces
sick
of
this
place
don
see
why
can
leave
right
away
could
come
with
you
now
mrs
had
already
got
up
don
think
that
will
be
possible
immediately
sharon
but
we
ll
certainly
work
on
it
she
turned
to
dalgliesh
thank
you
for
the
use
of
the
room
don
think
sharon
and
will
need
it
for
long
they
didn
but
the
forty
five
minutes
or
so
which
passed
before
they
reappeared
seemed
long
to
kate
sharon
who
was
no
longer
said
goodbye
to
mrs
and
enough
returned
to
the
manor
with
benton
as
the
gates
were
unlocked
by
the
security
guard
benton
said
mrs
seemed
very
nice
person
oh
she
all
right
have
been
in
touch
with
her
earlier
if
you
lot
hadn
been
watching
me
like
with
mouse
she
going
to
find
place
for
me
so
ll
be
out
of
here
soon
in
the
meantime
you
lay
off
wish
never
called
him
to
this
bloody
place
in
the
interview
room
mrs
put
on
her
jacket
and
took
up
her
bag
she
said
it
unfortunate
that
this
is
happening
she
was
doing
very
well
at
the
unit
but
it
was
reasonable
for
her
to
want
job
with
younger
people
the
old
patients
liked
her
though
they
her
bit
imagine
but
it
time
she
got
some
proper
training
and
settled
into
something
with
future
hope
to
find
place
for
her
fairly
soon
where
think
she
ll
be
happy
to
spend
few
weeks
until
we
can
settle
the
next
move
and
she
may
need
help
obviously
she
in
denial
about
but
if
you
re
asking
me
whether
she
killed
rhoda
gradwyn
which
of
course
you
aren
say
it
extremely
unlikely
would
say
impossible
except
that
one
can
never
use
that
word
about
anyone
dalgliesh
said
the
fact
that
she
here
and
with
her
record
is
can
see
that
unless
you
get
it
will
be
difficult
to
justify
anyone
else
but
like
most
hers
was
that
one
act
kate
said
she
managed
to
do
some
appalling
harm
in
her
short
life
child
murdered
and
good
man
job
and
future
at
risk
it
hard
to
look
at
her
without
seeing
an
image
of
that
smashed
face
on
hers
mrs
said
the
anger
of
child
can
be
terrible
if
an
out
of
control
four
year
old
had
and
the
strength
to
use
it
how
many
families
would
be
left
standing
dalgliesh
said
was
apparently
lovely
little
girl
possibly
to
other
people
not
perhaps
to
sharon
within
minutes
she
was
ready
to
leave
and
kate
drove
her
to
wareham
on
the
way
they
spoke
from
time
to
time
about
dorset
and
the
through
which
they
were
passing
but
mrs
didn
mention
sharon
name
and
nor
did
kate
kate
had
decided
that
it
would
be
both
polite
and
sensible
to
wait
with
mrs
until
the
train
had
arrived
and
she
was
safely
on
her
way
it
wasn
until
it
was
approaching
the
that
her
spoke
she
said
don
worry
about
sharon
will
be
looked
after
and
given
the
help
she
needs
and
he
won
be
candace
westhall
came
into
the
front
room
of
the
old
police
cottage
in
jacket
and
scarf
and
wearing
her
gloves
she
seated
herself
then
took
off
her
gloves
and
placed
them
large
and
on
the
table
between
herself
and
dalgliesh
like
an
challenge
the
meaning
if
crude
was
plain
she
had
been
called
from
necessary
job
once
again
to
answer
unnecessary
questions
her
was
and
he
knew
that
it
was
shared
if
less
openly
by
most
of
his
suspects
this
he
expected
and
in
part
understood
at
first
he
and
his
team
were
and
greeted
with
relief
action
would
be
taken
the
case
cleared
up
the
horror
which
was
also
an
embarrassment
would
be
the
innocent
the
guilty
probably
stranger
whose
fate
could
cause
no
distress
would
be
and
dealt
with
law
reason
and
order
would
replace
the
of
murder
but
there
had
been
no
arrest
and
no
sign
of
one
it
was
still
early
days
but
for
the
small
company
at
the
manor
there
was
no
end
to
his
presence
or
to
his
questioning
he
understood
their
growing
resentment
because
he
had
once
experienced
it
when
he
had
discovered
the
murdered
body
of
young
woman
on
beach
the
crime
was
not
on
his
patch
and
another
investigating
officer
had
taken
over
there
had
been
no
question
of
his
being
regarded
as
serious
suspect
but
the
police
questioning
had
been
and
it
seemed
to
him
unnecessarily
an
was
like
mental
he
said
in
rhoda
gradwyn
wrote
an
article
for
the
review
dealing
with
in
which
she
attacked
young
who
subsequently
took
her
own
life
what
was
your
relationship
with
she
met
his
eyes
hers
cold
with
dislike
and
he
thought
contempt
there
was
brief
silence
in
which
the
from
her
like
an
without
her
gaze
she
said
was
dear
friend
would
say
loved
her
except
that
you
would
relationship
which
doubt
can
make
you
understand
all
seem
to
be
defined
now
in
terms
of
she
was
my
but
her
talent
was
for
writing
not
her
to
complete
her
first
novel
and
to
it
for
did
you
know
at
the
time
that
of
it
had
been
from
an
earlier
work
are
you
asking
me
commander
whether
she
told
me
no
miss
westhall
asking
whether
you
knew
didn
not
until
read
gradwyn
article
kate
it
must
have
surprised
and
you
yes
inspector
both
of
those
things
dalgliesh
asked
did
you
take
any
action
see
rhoda
gradwyn
write
to
protest
either
to
her
or
to
the
review
saw
gradwyn
we
met
briefly
in
her
agent
office
at
her
request
it
was
mistake
she
was
of
course
totally
prefer
not
to
discuss
the
details
of
that
encounter
didn
know
at
the
time
that
was
already
dead
she
herself
three
days
after
the
review
appeared
so
you
didn
have
an
opportunity
to
see
her
ask
for
an
explanation
sorry
if
this
is
painful
for
you
surely
not
too
sorry
commander
let
there
be
honesty
between
us
like
rhoda
gradwyn
you
re
merely
doing
your
job
tried
to
get
in
touch
but
wouldn
see
me
the
door
locked
the
phone
wasted
time
with
gradwyn
when
might
have
succeeded
in
seeing
her
the
day
after
her
death
received
there
were
only
eight
words
and
no
signature
sorry
please
forgive
me
love
you
there
was
silence
then
she
said
the
was
the
least
important
part
of
novel
which
showed
extraordinary
promise
but
think
realised
that
she
would
never
write
another
and
for
her
that
was
death
and
there
was
the
humiliation
that
too
was
more
than
she
could
bear
did
you
hold
rhoda
gradwyn
responsible
she
was
responsible
she
murdered
my
friend
as
suppose
that
wasn
her
intention
there
would
be
no
hope
of
legal
but
didn
take
private
after
five
years
hatred
doesn
die
but
it
some
of
its
power
it
like
an
in
the
blood
never
completely
lost
to
up
unexpectedly
but
its
becoming
less
less
painful
with
the
passing
years
left
with
regret
and
lasting
didn
kill
rhoda
gradwyn
but
can
feel
even
minute
regret
that
she
dead
does
that
the
question
you
were
about
to
ask
commander
you
say
miss
westhall
that
you
didn
kill
rhoda
gradwyn
do
you
know
who
did
do
not
and
if
did
commander
think
it
unlikely
that
would
tell
you
she
rose
from
the
table
to
go
neither
dalgliesh
nor
kate
made
move
to
stop
her
in
the
three
days
following
rhoda
gradwyn
murder
lettie
was
struck
by
how
briefly
death
is
allowed
to
with
life
the
dead
however
they
die
are
away
with
decent
speed
to
their
place
tray
in
hospital
mortuary
the
room
the
pathologist
table
the
doctor
may
not
come
when
called
the
always
does
meals
however
or
are
prepared
and
eaten
post
ring
bills
have
to
be
paid
official
forms
filled
in
those
who
as
she
in
her
time
had
move
like
into
shadow
world
in
which
nothing
is
real
or
familiar
or
ever
will
be
again
but
even
they
speak
attempt
to
sleep
raise
food
to
their
mouths
continue
as
if
by
to
play
their
part
in
drama
in
which
all
the
other
characters
seem
familiar
with
their
at
the
manor
no
one
pretended
to
rhoda
gradwyn
her
death
was
shock
made
more
terrible
by
mystery
and
fear
but
the
routine
of
the
manor
went
on
dean
continued
to
cook
his
excellent
meals
although
certain
in
the
suggested
that
he
was
paying
perhaps
unconscious
to
death
kim
continued
to
serve
them
although
appetite
and
frank
seemed
conversation
only
the
coming
and
going
of
the
police
and
the
presence
of
the
cars
of
the
security
team
and
the
caravan
in
which
they
ate
and
slept
parked
outside
the
main
entrance
were
an
ever
constant
reminder
that
nothing
was
normal
there
had
been
of
interest
and
half
hope
when
sharon
was
called
for
by
inspector
miskin
and
taken
for
questioning
at
the
old
police
cottage
she
had
returned
to
say
briefly
that
commander
dalgliesh
was
preparing
for
her
to
leave
the
manor
and
friend
would
be
calling
for
her
in
three
days
in
the
meantime
she
didn
to
do
any
more
work
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
the
job
was
over
and
they
knew
where
they
could
shove
it
she
was
tired
and
upset
and
couldn
fucking
well
wait
to
get
away
from
the
fucking
manor
now
she
was
going
to
her
room
sharon
had
never
been
heard
to
an
and
the
word
was
as
shocking
as
if
it
had
come
from
lettie
mouth
commander
dalgliesh
had
then
been
with
george
chandler
powell
for
half
an
hour
and
after
he
left
george
had
summoned
them
to
the
library
they
had
gathered
silently
with
shared
anticipation
that
something
of
was
about
to
be
told
sharon
had
not
been
so
much
was
obvious
but
there
might
have
been
and
even
unwelcome
news
was
preferable
to
this
continuing
for
all
of
them
and
sometimes
they
confided
as
much
life
was
on
hold
even
the
decisions
which
clothes
to
put
on
in
the
morning
what
orders
to
give
dean
and
kimberley
required
an
effort
of
will
chandler
powell
did
not
keep
them
waiting
but
it
seemed
to
lettie
that
he
was
ill
at
ease
entering
the
library
he
seemed
uncertain
whether
to
stand
or
sit
but
after
moment
himself
beside
the
fire
he
must
know
himself
to
be
suspect
as
were
they
all
but
now
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
him
he
seemed
more
of
commander
dalgliesh
role
which
he
neither
wanted
nor
felt
comfortable
with
he
said
sorry
to
what
you
re
doing
but
commander
dalgliesh
has
asked
me
to
speak
to
you
and
it
seemed
sensible
to
get
you
together
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
as
you
know
sharon
will
be
leaving
us
in
few
days
time
there
was
an
incident
in
her
past
which
makes
her
progress
and
her
matter
for
the
service
and
it
thought
best
that
she
should
leave
the
manor
understand
that
sharon
will
be
co
operating
with
the
made
for
her
that
all
have
been
told
and
it
all
anyone
has
right
to
know
must
ask
you
all
not
to
discuss
sharon
among
or
to
speak
to
her
about
her
past
or
her
future
neither
of
which
is
our
concern
marcus
asked
does
this
mean
that
sharon
is
no
longer
regarded
as
suspect
if
she
ever
was
presumably
flavia
face
was
flushed
her
voice
uncertain
could
we
know
precisely
what
her
status
here
is
she
told
us
that
she
doesn
to
do
any
more
work
take
it
that
as
the
manor
seems
to
be
regarded
as
crime
scene
we
can
call
in
any
of
the
village
with
the
manor
empty
of
patients
there
not
lot
of
work
but
someone
has
to
do
it
dean
said
kim
and
could
help
but
what
about
her
food
usually
she
with
us
in
the
kitchen
suppose
she
upstairs
is
kim
expected
to
carry
up
trays
and
wait
on
her
his
voice
made
it
plain
that
this
would
not
be
helena
glanced
at
chandler
powell
it
was
obvious
his
was
wearing
thin
she
said
of
course
not
sharon
knows
the
time
of
the
meals
if
she
hungry
she
ll
appear
it
will
only
be
for
day
or
two
if
there
any
trouble
tell
me
and
ll
speak
to
commander
dalgliesh
meanwhile
we
carry
on
as
normally
as
possible
candace
spoke
for
the
first
time
as
was
one
of
those
who
interviewed
her
suppose
ought
to
take
some
responsibility
for
sharon
it
might
be
help
if
she
moved
into
stone
cottage
with
marcus
and
me
if
commander
dalgliesh
is
happy
about
it
we
have
the
room
and
she
can
give
me
hand
with
father
books
it
not
good
for
her
to
have
nothing
to
do
and
it
time
someone
tried
to
her
obsession
with
mary
last
summer
she
took
to
laying
wild
flowers
on
the
centre
stone
it
and
ll
go
up
to
her
now
and
see
if
she
down
chandler
powell
said
by
all
means
have
try
as
teacher
you
re
probably
more
experienced
than
the
rest
of
us
in
dealing
with
the
young
commander
dalgliesh
has
assured
me
that
sharon
doesn
if
she
does
it
for
the
police
or
the
service
to
provide
it
not
us
ve
my
trip
have
to
be
back
in
london
by
thursday
and
ll
need
marcus
with
me
sorry
if
that
sounds
like
but
have
to
catch
up
on
some
of
the
patients
should
have
operated
on
this
week
obviously
had
to
all
those
the
security
team
will
be
here
and
shall
arrange
for
two
of
them
to
sleep
in
marcus
asked
and
the
police
did
dalgliesh
say
when
they
expect
to
leave
no
and
hadn
the
to
ask
they
ve
only
been
here
three
days
so
unless
they
make
an
arrest
imagine
we
ll
have
to
some
police
presence
for
quite
time
flavia
said
you
mean
we
ll
have
to
it
you
ll
be
safely
out
of
it
in
london
are
the
police
happy
about
your
leaving
chandler
powell
looked
at
her
coldly
what
legal
power
do
you
suppose
commander
dalgliesh
has
to
me
and
then
he
was
gone
leaving
the
little
group
with
the
impression
that
somehow
they
had
all
they
looked
at
each
other
in
an
silence
it
was
broken
by
candace
well
better
sharon
and
perhaps
helena
you
have
private
word
with
george
know
in
the
cottage
and
it
hardly
me
as
it
does
the
rest
of
you
but
do
work
here
and
rather
the
security
team
slept
outside
the
manor
it
bad
