beginning
of
the
death
of
dream
rhoda
woke
as
always
not
to
slow
rise
to
full
consciousness
but
to
an
instant
alert
to
the
new
day
she
lay
quietly
for
few
minutes
relishing
the
warmth
and
comfort
of
the
bed
before
sleep
she
had
partly
drawn
the
curtains
and
now
narrow
band
of
pale
light
showed
that
she
had
slept
longer
than
expected
certainly
longer
than
was
usual
and
that
was
breaking
she
had
slept
well
but
now
the
need
for
hot
tea
was
she
rang
the
number
on
the
bedside
table
and
heard
male
voice
good
morning
miss
gradwyn
dean
bostock
speaking
from
the
kitchen
is
there
anything
we
can
bring
you
tea
please
large
pot
milk
but
no
sugar
would
you
like
to
order
breakfast
now
yes
but
bring
it
please
in
half
an
hour
fresh
pressed
one
egg
on
white
toast
then
toast
and
ll
have
it
in
my
room
the
egg
was
test
if
it
came
perfectly
cooked
the
toast
lightly
and
neither
hard
nor
she
could
on
good
food
when
she
returned
for
her
operation
and
longer
stay
she
would
return
and
to
this
room
putting
on
her
dressing
gown
she
went
to
the
window
and
saw
the
of
and
hills
lay
over
the
so
that
the
rounded
looked
like
in
pale
silver
sea
it
had
been
clear
and
cold
night
the
grass
on
the
narrow
stretch
of
lawn
under
her
windows
was
pale
and
by
but
already
the
sun
was
beginning
to
green
and
soften
it
on
the
high
of
oak
three
were
silent
and
motionless
like
carefully
placed
black
below
stretched
lime
avenue
which
led
to
low
stone
wall
and
beyond
it
small
circle
of
stones
at
first
only
the
of
the
stones
were
visible
but
as
she
watched
the
rose
and
the
circle
became
complete
at
this
distance
and
with
the
ring
partly
obscured
by
the
wall
she
could
see
only
that
the
stones
were
of
different
crude
around
central
taller
stone
they
must
she
thought
be
as
she
gazed
her
ears
caught
the
soft
closing
of
the
sitting
room
door
tea
had
arrived
still
gazing
she
saw
in
the
far
distance
narrow
strip
of
silver
light
and
with
of
the
heart
realised
that
it
must
be
the
sea
to
leave
the
view
she
stood
for
few
seconds
before
turning
and
saw
with
small
shock
of
surprise
that
young
woman
had
entered
and
was
standing
silently
her
she
was
slight
figure
wearing
blue
checked
dress
with
shapeless
cardigan
over
it
which
proclaimed
an
status
she
was
obviously
not
nurse
yet
had
none
of
the
assurance
of
the
confidence
born
of
recognised
and
familiar
job
rhoda
thought
she
was
probably
older
than
she
looked
but
the
uniform
particularly
the
ill
fitting
cardigan
diminished
her
into
childhood
she
had
pale
face
and
straight
brown
hair
drawn
to
one
side
in
long
patterned
her
mouth
was
small
the
top
lip
perfect
so
full
that
it
looked
swollen
but
the
bottom
her
eyes
were
pale
blue
and
little
under
straight
brows
they
were
watchful
almost
wary
even
little
in
their
she
said
in
voice
which
was
more
town
than
country
an
ordinary
voice
with
hint
of
which
rhoda
thought
ve
brought
your
morning
tea
sharon
bateman
and
help
in
the
kitchen
the
tray
outside
do
you
want
it
in
here
yes
in
moment
is
the
tea
freshly
made
yes
brought
it
up
immediately
rhoda
was
tempted
to
say
the
word
was
inappropriate
but
let
it
pass
she
said
then
leave
it
for
couple
of
minutes
to
ve
been
looking
at
the
stone
circle
ve
been
told
about
it
but
didn
realise
that
it
was
so
close
to
the
manor
presumably
it
yes
the
cheverell
stones
they
re
quite
famous
miss
cressett
says
they
re
over
three
thousand
years
old
she
says
stone
are
rare
in
dorset
rhoda
said
last
night
when
was
opening
the
saw
light
flickering
it
looked
like
torch
it
came
from
that
direction
perhaps
someone
was
walking
among
the
stones
presumably
the
circle
lot
of
visitors
not
that
many
don
think
most
people
know
they
re
here
the
keep
away
it
was
probably
mr
chandler
powell
he
fond
of
walking
in
the
grounds
at
night
we
didn
expect
him
but
he
arrived
last
night
no
one
from
the
village
goes
to
the
stones
after
dark
they
re
scared
of
seeing
the
ghost
of
mary
walking
and
watching
who
is
mary
the
stones
are
she
was
tied
to
the
middle
stone
and
burnt
there
in
it
different
from
all
the
other
stones
taller
and
darker
she
was
as
witch
it
usually
old
women
who
got
burnt
as
but
she
was
only
twenty
you
can
still
see
the
brown
patch
where
the
fire
was
no
grass
ever
in
the
middle
of
the
stones
rhoda
said
no
doubt
because
people
over
the
have
that
it
doesn
probably
by
pouring
on
something
to
kill
the
grass
surely
you
don
believe
that
nonsense
they
say
that
her
could
be
heard
as
far
as
the
church
she
the
village
as
she
burnt
and
afterwards
nearly
all
the
children
died
you
can
see
the
remains
of
some
of
the
in
the
although
the
names
are
too
faint
now
to
be
read
mog
says
that
on
the
date
she
was
burnt
you
can
still
hear
her
on
night
presumably
the
conversation
was
becoming
but
rhoda
felt
it
difficult
to
put
stop
to
it
the
child
she
looked
little
more
and
was
probably
not
much
older
than
mary
had
been
was
obviously
with
the
burning
she
said
the
village
children
died
of
childhood
perhaps
or
before
she
was
they
mary
for
the
and
after
she
was
burnt
they
her
for
the
deaths
so
you
don
believe
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
can
come
back
to
visit
us
the
dead
don
return
to
visit
us
either
as
spirits
whatever
that
means
or
in
any
other
form
but
the
dead
are
here
mary
isn
at
rest
the
portraits
in
this
house
those
faces
they
haven
left
the
manor
know
they
don
want
me
here
she
didn
sound
or
even
particularly
worried
it
was
statement
of
fact
rhoda
said
that
ridiculous
they
re
dead
they
re
beyond
thought
have
an
old
in
the
house
where
live
tudor
sometimes
try
to
imagine
what
he
would
be
thinking
if
he
could
see
me
living
and
working
there
but
the
emotion
is
mine
not
his
even
if
persuaded
myself
that
could
with
him
he
wouldn
speak
to
me
mary
is
dead
she
can
come
back
she
paused
and
said
ll
have
my
tea
now
the
tray
was
brought
in
delicate
china
of
the
same
pattern
the
matching
milk
sharon
said
need
to
ask
you
about
lunch
whether
you
want
it
served
here
or
in
the
patients
sitting
room
that
in
the
long
gallery
below
there
for
you
to
choose
she
took
paper
from
her
cardigan
pocket
and
handed
it
over
there
were
two
choices
rhoda
said
tell
the
ll
have
the
the
on
and
with
potatoes
followed
by
the
and
like
glass
of
chilled
white
wine
would
be
fine
ll
have
it
in
my
sitting
room
at
one
clock
sharon
left
the
room
drinking
her
tea
rhoda
contemplated
what
she
recognised
as
confused
emotions
she
had
never
seen
the
girl
before
nor
heard
of
her
and
hers
was
face
she
would
not
easily
have
forgotten
and
yet
she
was
if
not
familiar
at
least
an
reminder
of
some
past
emotion
not
felt
at
the
time
but
still
in
some
of
memory
and
the
brief
encounter
had
feeling
that
the
house
held
more
than
the
secrets
in
or
into
it
would
be
interesting
to
do
little
to
once
more
that
passion
to
discover
the
truth
about
people
people
as
or
in
their
working
the
things
they
revealed
about
themselves
the
carefully
they
presented
to
the
world
it
was
curiosity
she
had
now
determined
to
mental
energy
she
planned
to
to
different
purpose
this
might
well
be
her
last
investigation
if
one
could
call
it
that
it
was
unlikely
to
be
her
last
curiosity
and
she
realised
that
it
was
already
losing
its
power
that
it
was
no
longer
compulsion
perhaps
when
she
had
rid
herself
of
the
scar
it
would
have
gone
for
good
or
remained
as
no
more
than
useful
to
but
she
would
like
to
know
more
about
the
of
cheverell
manor
and
if
indeed
there
were
interesting
to
be
discovered
sharon
with
her
obvious
need
to
chat
might
well
be
the
one
most
likely
to
reveal
them
she
had
booked
in
only
until
after
lunch
but
half
day
would
be
inadequate
even
to
the
village
and
the
manor
grounds
particularly
as
she
had
an
appointment
with
sister
holland
to
look
at
the
operating
theatre
and
recovery
suite
the
early
fine
day
and
it
would
be
good
to
walk
in
the
gardens
and
perhaps
beyond
she
liked
the
place
the
house
this
room
she
would
ask
if
she
could
stay
until
the
following
afternoon
and
in
two
weeks
time
she
would
return
for
her
operation
and
her
new
life
would
begin
the
at
the
manor
stood
some
yards
from
the
east
wing
half
obscured
by
circle
of
bushes
its
early
history
and
the
date
when
it
was
built
were
but
it
was
certainly
older
than
the
manor
single
plain
rectangular
with
stone
under
the
window
there
was
no
means
of
lighting
except
by
and
cardboard
box
of
these
was
on
chair
to
the
left
of
the
door
together
with
an
of
many
wooden
which
looked
like
from
ancient
and
the
bedrooms
of
victorian
since
no
matches
were
provided
the
casual
visitor
had
to
make
his
if
any
without
benefit
of
their
light
the
cross
on
the
stone
was
carved
perhaps
by
some
estate
either
in
to
orders
or
under
some
private
compulsion
of
or
religious
it
could
hardly
have
been
on
the
order
of
some
long
dead
cressett
who
would
surely
have
chosen
silver
or
more
important
except
for
the
cross
the
was
bare
no
doubt
its
earlier
had
changed
with
the
great
of
the
once
later
completely
the
cross
was
directly
in
marcus
westhall
and
sometimes
for
long
of
silence
he
would
his
gaze
on
it
as
if
expecting
from
it
some
mysterious
power
an
aid
to
resolution
grace
which
he
realised
would
always
be
under
this
had
been
fought
the
great
of
state
and
church
had
changed
the
face
of
men
and
women
had
been
burnt
and
murdered
it
had
been
carried
with
its
message
of
love
and
into
the
of
human
imagining
for
him
it
served
as
an
aid
to
concentration
the
focus
of
the
thoughts
which
crept
and
rose
and
in
his
mind
like
brown
leaves
in
wind
he
had
entered
quietly
and
himself
as
usual
on
the
back
wooden
gazed
at
the
cross
but
not
in
since
he
had
no
idea
how
to
begin
or
with
whom
precisely
he
would
be
to
he
sometimes
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
to
find
that
secret
door
said
to
be
open
to
the
touch
and
to
feel
this
burden
of
guilt
and
fall
from
his
shoulders
but
he
knew
that
one
of
human
experience
was
as
closed
to
him
as
was
music
to
the
tone
lettie
frensham
could
have
found
it
early
on
sunday
mornings
he
would
see
her
cycling
past
stone
cottage
her
figure
pushing
against
the
slight
to
the
road
summoned
by
church
to
some
distant
village
church
by
her
and
never
spoken
of
he
had
never
seen
her
in
the
if
she
came
it
must
be
at
times
when
he
was
with
george
in
theatre
he
thought
that
he
wouldn
have
if
they
had
shared
this
sanctuary
if
she
had
sometimes
quietly
entered
to
sit
in
silence
beside
him
he
knew
nothing
about
her
except
that
she
had
once
been
helena
cressett
and
he
had
no
idea
why
she
should
have
returned
to
the
manor
after
all
these
years
but
in
her
and
calm
good
sense
she
seemed
to
him
like
still
pool
in
house
where
he
sensed
that
ran
deep
not
least
in
his
own
troubled
mind
of
the
rest
of
the
manor
only
mog
attended
the
village
church
and
was
indeed
of
the
marcus
suspected
that
mog
still
powerful
at
was
his
way
of
an
at
least
to
the
village
against
the
manor
and
to
the
old
against
the
new
he
would
serve
the
while
miss
cressett
was
in
charge
and
the
money
was
good
but
mr
chandler
powell
could
buy
only
carefully
part
of
his
apart
from
the
cross
the
only
sign
that
this
was
in
some
sense
set
apart
was
set
in
the
wall
beside
the
door
to
the
memory
of
wife
of
sir
charles
cressett
who
found
peace
in
this
but
stronger
still
in
earth
and
air
and
in
the
sea
the
man
of
and
far
beneath
the
tide
and
in
the
seat
to
faith
where
ask
is
have
where
is
find
where
knock
is
open
wide
as
wife
but
not
wife
and
dead
at
thirty
two
brief
marriage
then
he
had
the
so
different
from
the
usual
to
by
the
eighteenth
century
poet
but
made
no
enquiries
about
like
the
rest
of
the
household
he
was
inhibited
from
speaking
to
helena
about
her
family
but
he
found
the
the
should
be
simply
stone
and
wood
no
other
place
at
the
manor
held
such
peace
not
even
the
library
where
sometimes
he
sat
alone
always
there
was
the
fear
that
solitude
would
be
interrupted
that
the
door
would
be
opened
to
the
dreaded
words
so
familiar
from
his
childhood
oh
here
you
are
marcus
we
ve
been
looking
for
you
but
no
one
had
ever
looked
for
him
in
the
it
was
strange
that
this
stone
should
be
so
even
the
was
reminder
of
in
the
uncertain
days
of
the
there
had
been
between
the
local
priest
who
to
the
old
religion
and
the
then
sir
cressett
who
was
inclined
to
the
new
ways
of
thought
and
needing
an
for
his
he
had
sent
the
male
members
of
the
household
at
night
to
the
one
from
the
lady
which
had
caused
the
between
church
and
manor
for
generations
then
during
the
war
the
manor
had
been
briefly
occupied
by
after
successful
local
and
the
dead
had
been
laid
out
on
this
stone
floor
marcus
put
thoughts
and
memories
from
him
and
concentrated
on
his
own
he
had
to
make
decision
and
make
it
now
whether
to
remain
at
the
manor
or
to
go
with
surgical
team
to
africa
he
knew
what
his
sister
wanted
what
he
had
come
to
see
as
solution
for
all
his
problems
but
was
this
running
away
from
more
than
his
job
he
had
heard
the
mixture
of
anger
and
in
his
lover
voice
who
worked
as
theatre
nurse
at
st
angela
had
wanted
him
to
join
march
the
was
not
unexpected
it
wasn
the
first
time
that
had
he
remembered
his
words
don
see
the
point
of
it
if
were
you
wouldn
expect
me
to
go
down
the
high
street
to
that
was
straight
why
do
we
need
to
do
it
isn
the
whole
point
that
we
have
perfect
right
to
be
what
we
are
we
don
need
to
justify
it
or
it
or
it
to
the
world
don
see
why
my
should
be
of
interest
to
anyone
except
you
he
tried
to
forget
the
of
the
that
followed
broken
voice
at
the
end
his
face
smeared
with
tears
the
face
of
child
it
nothing
to
do
with
being
private
you
re
running
away
you
re
ashamed
of
what
you
are
of
what
am
and
it
the
same
with
the
job
you
stay
with
chandler
powell
your
skill
on
bunch
of
rich
women
with
their
looks
when
you
could
be
working
full
time
up
here
in
london
you
find
job
of
course
you
find
job
not
so
easily
now
and
not
to
waste
my
talent
going
to
africa
to
get
away
from
me
no
to
get
away
from
myself
you
ll
never
do
that
never
never
tears
the
slamming
of
the
door
were
the
final
memory
he
had
been
staring
at
the
so
that
the
cross
seemed
to
and
become
moving
he
shut
his
eyes
and
breathed
the
damp
cold
smell
of
the
place
felt
the
hard
wood
of
the
against
his
back
he
remembered
the
last
major
operation
he
had
at
in
st
angela
an
elderly
patient
whose
face
had
been
by
dog
she
was
already
sick
and
given
her
there
must
only
have
been
year
of
life
at
most
to
save
but
with
what
what
skill
george
had
put
together
over
long
hours
face
that
could
bear
the
of
the
world
nothing
was
ever
neglected
nothing
hurried
or
forced
what
right
had
george
to
waste
that
commitment
and
skill
even
for
three
days
week
on
women
who
disliked
the
shape
of
nose
or
mouth
or
breast
and
who
wanted
the
world
to
know
that
they
could
afford
him
what
was
so
important
to
him
that
he
could
spare
time
on
work
surgeon
could
do
and
do
as
well
but
to
leave
him
now
would
still
be
betrayal
of
man
he
not
to
leave
him
would
be
betrayal
of
himself
and
of
candace
the
sister
who
him
knew
that
he
had
to
break
free
and
urged
him
to
have
the
courage
to
act
she
herself
had
never
courage
he
had
slept
at
stone
cottage
and
spent
enough
time
there
during
his
father
last
illness
to
have
gained
some
idea
of
what
she
had
to
bear
during
those
two
years
and
now
she
was
left
with
her
job
ended
no
other
in
sight
and
the
prospect
of
his
leaving
for
africa
it
was
what
she
wanted
for
him
had
worked
for
and
but
he
knew
it
would
leave
her
lonely
he
was
planning
to
the
two
people
who
loved
him
candace
and
and
george
chandler
powell
the
man
he
most
admired
his
life
was
mess
some
part
of
his
nature
in
confidence
had
led
him
into
this
pattern
of
of
leaving
things
to
sort
themselves
out
as
if
he
put
his
faith
in
which
would
operate
on
his
if
left
alone
in
the
three
years
he
had
spent
at
the
manor
how
much
of
that
was
the
satisfaction
of
learning
from
man
at
the
top
of
his
profession
not
wanting
to
let
him
down
all
those
had
played
part
but
essentially
he
had
stayed
because
it
was
easier
than
facing
up
to
the
decision
to
leave
but
he
would
face
up
to
it
now
he
would
break
away
and
not
only
physically
in
africa
he
could
make
difference
more
profound
more
lasting
than
anything
he
had
done
at
the
manor
he
had
to
do
something
new
and
if
this
were
running
away
he
would
be
running
away
to
people
who
desperately
needed
his
skills
to
wide
eyed
children
with
appalling
and
to
the
victims
of
who
needed
to
be
accepted
and
made
whole
to
the
the
and
the
he
needed
to
smell
stronger
air
if
he
didn
face
chandler
powell
now
he
would
never
have
the
courage
to
act
he
got
up
and
walked
like
an
old
man
to
the
door
then
after
pausing
moment
stepped
with
resolution
towards
the
manor
like
going
into
marcus
found
george
chandler
powell
in
the
operating
suite
he
was
alone
and
occupied
in
new
of
each
carefully
turning
it
over
in
his
hand
and
it
in
its
tray
with
kind
of
this
was
job
for
an
operating
department
assistant
and
would
arrive
at
seven
clock
next
morning
to
for
the
first
operation
of
the
day
marcus
knew
that
checking
the
didn
mean
that
chandler
powell
had
little
confidence
in
he
no
one
whom
he
couldn
trust
but
here
he
was
at
home
with
his
two
his
work
and
his
house
and
now
he
was
like
child
picking
over
his
favourite
marcus
said
wanted
to
have
word
with
you
if
you
ve
got
time
even
to
his
own
ears
his
voice
sounded
unnatural
oddly
pitched
chandler
powell
didn
look
up
that
on
what
you
mean
by
word
word
or
serious
talk
suppose
serious
talk
then
ll
finish
here
and
we
ll
go
to
the
office
for
marcus
there
was
something
intimidating
in
the
suggestion
it
was
too
of
to
his
father
study
he
wished
he
could
speak
now
get
it
over
with
but
he
waited
until
the
last
drawer
was
shut
and
george
chandler
powell
led
the
way
out
of
the
door
into
the
garden
through
the
back
of
the
house
and
the
hall
to
the
office
lettie
frensham
was
seated
at
the
computer
but
as
they
entered
she
muttered
low
and
quietly
left
chandler
powell
sat
down
at
the
desk
marcus
to
chair
and
sat
waiting
marcus
tried
to
himself
that
the
silence
wasn
carefully
controlled
impatience
since
it
seemed
unlikely
that
george
would
speak
first
marcus
said
ve
come
to
decision
about
africa
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
ve
finally
made
up
my
mind
to
join
mr
team
be
grateful
if
you
could
release
me
in
three
months
time
chandler
powell
said
take
it
you
ve
been
to
london
and
spoken
to
mr
no
doubt
he
pointed
out
some
of
the
problems
your
future
career
among
them
yes
he
did
all
that
is
one
of
the
best
plastic
surgeons
in
probably
among
the
six
best
in
the
world
he
also
teacher
we
can
take
his
for
granted
of
surgery
he
goes
to
africa
to
teach
and
to
set
up
centre
of
that
what
want
to
learn
how
to
cope
for
themselves
not
to
have
white
people
going
in
to
take
over
wasn
thinking
of
taking
over
just
of
helping
there
so
much
to
be
done
mr
thinks
could
be
useful
of
course
he
does
he
wouldn
otherwise
want
to
waste
his
time
or
yours
but
what
exactly
do
you
think
you
re
offering
you
re
an
and
competent
surgeon
but
you
re
not
to
teach
nor
even
to
cope
with
the
most
complicated
cases
and
even
year
in
africa
will
seriously
with
your
career
that
is
if
you
see
yourself
as
having
one
it
hasn
been
helpful
to
you
staying
here
and
pointed
that
out
when
you
first
came
this
new
medical
makes
training
far
more
rigid
have
become
year
doctors
and
we
all
know
what
mess
the
government
have
made
there
house
officers
are
out
are
surgical
and
god
knows
how
long
all
this
will
last
before
they
think
of
something
else
more
forms
to
fill
in
more
more
interference
with
people
trying
to
get
on
with
their
jobs
but
one
thing
certain
if
you
want
to
make
career
in
surgery
you
need
to
be
on
the
training
and
that
become
pretty
it
might
be
possible
to
get
you
back
on
stream
and
will
try
to
help
but
it
won
be
if
you
re
off
to
africa
and
it
not
as
if
you
re
going
from
religious
wouldn
if
you
were
but
could
understand
well
if
not
understand
accept
there
are
people
like
that
but
have
never
thought
of
you
as
particularly
no
don
think
could
claim
to
be
well
what
are
you
or
guilt
understand
that
still
popular
george
there
useful
work
for
me
to
do
not
anything
except
this
strong
conviction
that
africa
would
be
right
for
me
can
stay
here
you
said
that
yourself
not
asking
you
to
just
asking
you
to
consider
carefully
which
way
you
want
your
future
career
to
go
that
is
if
you
want
career
in
surgery
but
not
going
to
waste
breath
trying
to
persuade
you
if
you
ve
made
up
your
mind
suggest
you
think
it
over
and
for
the
present
ll
take
it
that
shall
need
replacement
for
you
in
three
months
time
know
it
will
be
for
you
and
sorry
about
that
and
know
what
you
am
grateful
ll
always
be
grateful
don
think
you
need
to
on
about
that
never
an
agreeable
word
between
colleagues
we
ll
take
it
that
you
ll
leave
in
three
months
time
hope
you
find
in
africa
whatever
it
is
you
re
looking
for
or
is
it
case
of
finding
relief
from
whatever
it
is
you
re
running
away
from
and
now
if
that
all
like
the
use
of
my
office
there
was
one
other
thing
and
marcus
himself
to
say
it
words
had
been
spoken
which
had
destroyed
relationship
nothing
could
be
worse
he
said
it
about
patient
rhoda
gradwyn
she
here
now
know
that
and
she
ll
be
back
again
in
two
weeks
for
her
operation
unless
she
takes
dislike
to
the
manor
and
for
bed
at
st
angela
wouldn
that
be
more
convenient
for
her
or
for
me
was
wondering
whether
you
really
want
to
investigative
at
the
manor
and
if
one
comes
others
may
follow
and
can
imagine
what
gradwyn
will
write
rich
women
spending
fortune
because
they
re
with
how
they
look
valuable
surgeons
skills
which
could
be
better
used
she
ll
find
something
to
that
her
job
patients
on
our
and
expect
an
absolute
mean
isn
that
what
this
place
is
about
not
altogether
and
don
to
between
patients
on
any
grounds
other
than
medical
need
and
frankly
wouldn
lift
finger
to
the
popular
press
when
you
consider
the
and
of
we
need
some
strong
enough
to
shout
occasionally
used
to
believe
that
lived
in
free
country
now
have
to
accept
that
don
but
at
least
we
have
free
press
and
willing
to
put
up
with
certain
amount
of
and
even
to
ensure
it
remains
free
suppose
candace
has
been
getting
at
you
you
hardly
have
thought
this
up
on
your
own
if
she
has
personal
reasons
for
her
to
miss
gradwyn
she
need
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
she
not
required
to
the
patients
are
not
her
concern
she
doesn
need
to
see
her
either
now
or
when
she
don
my
patients
to
your
sister
and
now
if
you
ve
nothing
else
to
say
sure
both
of
us
have
work
to
do
know
have
he
got
up
and
stood
at
the
door
without
another
word
marcus
walked
past
him
george
sleeve
and
left
he
felt
like
an
in
this
was
the
he
had
almost
for
years
now
with
horror
he
knew
that
what
he
felt
was
close
to
hatred
thought
almost
hope
and
took
hold
of
his
mind
perhaps
the
west
wing
the
whole
would
be
forced
to
close
if
there
were
disaster
fire
scandal
if
the
supply
of
patients
dried
up
how
could
chandler
powell
carry
on
he
tried
to
shut
his
mind
against
the
most
but
they
were
even
to
his
disgust
the
most
and
terrible
of
all
the
death
of
patient
chandler
powell
waited
until
marcus
footsteps
had
faded
then
left
the
manor
to
see
candace
westhall
he
hadn
intended
to
spend
this
wednesday
becoming
in
arguments
with
either
marcus
or
his
sister
but
now
that
decision
had
been
made
it
would
be
as
well
to
see
what
candace
had
in
mind
it
was
going
to
be
if
she
too
had
decided
to
leave
but
presumably
now
that
her
father
was
dead
she
would
want
to
return
to
her
university
post
for
the
next
term
even
if
that
wasn
the
plan
her
job
at
the
manor
taking
over
from
helena
when
helena
was
in
london
and
helping
out
in
the
office
was
hardly
career
he
disliked
in
the
domestic
management
of
the
manor
but
if
candace
now
intended
to
leave
the
sooner
he
knew
the
better
he
walked
up
the
lane
to
stone
cottage
in
the
winter
sunshine
and
approaching
saw
that
there
was
dirty
car
parked
outside
rose
cottage
so
the
westhalls
cousin
robin
boyton
had
arrived
he
remembered
that
helena
had
said
something
about
his
visit
with
marked
lack
of
enthusiasm
which
he
suspected
was
shared
by
both
the
westhalls
boyton
tended
to
book
the
cottage
at
short
notice
but
as
it
was
vacant
helena
obviously
had
found
it
difficult
to
refuse
him
he
was
always
interested
in
how
different
stone
cottage
had
looked
since
candace
and
her
father
had
arrived
some
two
and
half
years
previously
she
was
an
chandler
powell
suspected
that
it
had
been
one
excuse
for
getting
away
from
peregrine
westhall
bedside
he
had
only
visited
the
old
man
twice
before
his
death
but
he
knew
as
he
suspected
did
the
whole
village
that
he
was
demanding
and
patient
to
care
for
and
now
that
he
was
dead
and
marcus
about
to
leave
england
no
doubt
candace
released
from
what
must
have
been
would
have
her
own
plans
for
the
future
she
was
the
back
lawn
wearing
her
old
tweed
jacket
trousers
and
which
she
kept
for
her
strong
dark
hair
covered
by
cap
pulled
down
to
her
ears
it
the
stark
resemblance
to
her
father
the
dominant
nose
the
deep
set
eyes
under
straight
brows
the
length
and
of
the
lips
face
which
with
the
hair
concealed
looked
how
oddly
the
westhall
had
fallen
so
that
it
was
marcus
not
she
in
whom
the
old
man
features
were
softened
into
an
almost
feminine
gentleness
seeing
him
she
propped
the
against
tree
trunk
and
came
to
meet
him
she
said
good
morning
george
think
know
why
you
ve
come
was
just
going
to
break
for
coffee
come
in
will
you
she
led
him
through
the
side
door
the
one
used
into
the
old
which
with
its
stone
walls
and
floor
looked
more
like
an
convenient
for
worn
out
equipment
dominated
by
hung
with
of
mugs
and
cups
of
keys
and
variety
of
plates
and
they
moved
to
the
small
kitchen
it
was
tidy
but
chandler
powell
told
himself
that
it
was
time
something
was
done
to
and
the
place
and
wondered
that
candace
to
be
good
cook
hadn
complained
about
it
she
switched
on
coffee
and
took
down
two
mugs
from
the
cupboard
and
they
stood
in
silence
until
the
coffee
was
ready
she
had
collected
of
milk
from
the
and
they
passed
into
the
sitting
room
seated
opposite
her
at
square
table
he
thought
again
how
little
had
been
done
to
the
cottage
most
of
the
furniture
was
hers
taken
from
store
some
pieces
others
too
large
for
the
space
three
walls
were
lined
with
wooden
brought
to
the
cottage
by
peregrine
westhall
as
part
of
his
library
when
the
old
man
had
moved
from
his
nursing
home
the
library
had
been
by
him
to
his
old
school
and
the
books
thought
worth
had
been
collected
leaving
the
walls
with
empty
on
which
the
fell
against
each
other
sad
of
the
whole
room
had
an
air
of
and
loss
only
the
settle
at
right
angles
to
the
fireplace
gave
promise
of
comfort
he
said
without
marcus
has
just
given
me
the
news
that
he
leaving
for
africa
in
three
months
wondering
how
far
you
influenced
that
not
very
intelligent
plan
you
re
not
suggesting
that
my
brother
isn
capable
of
making
his
own
decisions
about
his
life
he
can
make
them
whether
he
feels
free
to
carry
them
out
is
something
else
obviously
you
influenced
him
it
would
be
surprising
if
you
hadn
you
re
older
by
eight
years
with
your
mother
an
for
most
of
his
childhood
it
not
surprising
that
he
to
you
didn
you
more
or
less
bring
him
up
you
seem
to
know
great
deal
about
my
family
if
did
influence
him
it
been
to
him
it
time
he
left
can
see
it
for
you
george
and
he
sorry
about
that
we
both
are
but
you
ll
find
someone
else
you
ve
known
about
this
possibility
for
year
now
you
must
have
replacement
in
mind
she
was
right
he
had
retired
surgeon
in
his
own
field
highly
competent
if
not
who
would
be
glad
to
assist
for
three
days
week
he
said
that
isn
what
concerns
me
what
does
marcus
propose
to
stay
in
africa
permanently
that
hardly
seems
to
work
there
for
year
or
two
and
then
come
home
to
what
he
needs
to
think
very
clearly
about
what
he
wants
to
do
with
his
life
candace
said
so
do
we
all
he
has
thought
he
convinced
this
is
something
he
has
to
do
and
now
that
probate
has
been
granted
for
father
will
the
money
there
he
won
be
burden
in
africa
he
won
go
empty
handed
you
surely
understand
one
thing
the
need
to
do
what
every
of
your
body
you
is
for
you
haven
you
lived
your
life
like
that
don
we
all
at
some
time
or
another
make
decision
which
we
know
is
absolutely
right
the
assurance
that
some
some
change
is
and
even
if
it
to
resist
it
will
be
greater
failure
suppose
some
people
would
see
that
as
call
from
god
in
marcus
case
it
seems
to
me
more
like
an
excuse
for
running
away
but
there
time
for
that
too
for
escape
marcus
needs
to
get
away
from
this
place
from
the
job
from
the
manor
from
you
from
me
it
was
quietly
spoken
response
without
anger
as
if
this
was
suggestion
he
needed
to
think
over
his
face
gave
nothing
away
she
said
from
your
success
your
your
reputation
your
he
has
to
be
his
own
man
wasn
aware
that
was
stopping
him
from
being
his
own
man
whatever
that
means
no
you
aren
aware
that
why
he
has
to
go
and
have
to
help
him
you
ll
miss
him
yes
george
ll
miss
him
he
said
anxious
not
to
sound
curious
but
needing
to
know
will
you
want
to
stay
on
here
for
time
if
you
do
know
helena
will
be
glad
of
help
someone
has
to
take
over
when
she
makes
her
to
london
but
suppose
you
ll
want
to
get
back
to
the
university
no
george
that
isn
possible
they
ve
decided
to
shut
down
the
department
not
enough
and
they
ve
offered
me
part
time
job
in
one
of
the
new
they
re
setting
up
religion
or
whatever
that
may
mean
as
not
competent
to
teach
either
be
returning
happy
to
stay
on
here
for
at
least
six
months
after
marcus
leaves
in
nine
months
should
have
made
up
my
mind
what
going
to
do
but
with
marcus
gone
can
justify
continuing
to
live
here
rent
free
if
you
ll
accept
some
rent
be
grateful
to
have
this
place
until
ve
settled
where
ll
go
that
won
be
necessary
rather
not
any
kind
of
here
but
if
you
could
stay
on
for
nine
months
or
so
that
would
be
fine
if
helena
happy
about
it
she
said
ll
ask
her
of
course
like
to
make
some
changes
while
father
was
alive
he
so
hated
any
or
noise
particularly
coming
in
that
there
was
no
point
in
doing
anything
but
the
kitchen
is
depressing
and
too
small
if
you
re
going
to
use
this
cottage
for
staff
or
visitors
after
ve
left
think
you
ll
have
to
do
something
about
it
the
sensible
thing
would
be
to
make
the
old
into
kitchen
and
the
sitting
room
chandler
powell
had
no
wish
now
to
discuss
the
state
of
the
kitchen
he
said
well
have
word
with
helena
about
it
and
you
better
speak
to
lettie
about
the
cost
of
the
cottage
it
needs
doing
think
we
could
manage
some
he
had
finished
his
coffee
and
discovered
what
he
needed
to
know
but
before
he
could
get
up
she
said
there
one
other
thing
you
ve
got
rhoda
gradwyn
here
and
understand
she
coming
back
in
two
weeks
for
her
operation
you
ve
got
private
beds
at
st
angela
london
more
appropriate
for
her
anyway
if
she
here
she
ll
get
bored
and
that
when
women
like
her
become
most
dangerous
and
she
is
dangerous
so
he
had
been
right
candace
was
at
the
back
of
this
obsession
with
rhoda
gradwyn
he
said
dangerous
in
what
way
dangerous
to
whom
if
knew
that
be
less
worried
you
must
know
something
of
her
reputation
that
is
if
you
read
anything
other
than
the
surgical
she
an
investigative
journalist
one
of
the
worst
kind
she
out
gossip
like
with
she
makes
it
her
job
to
discover
things
about
other
people
which
give
them
distress
or
pain
or
worse
and
would
the
great
public
if
they
became
known
she
secrets
for
money
he
said
isn
that
and
even
if
it
true
it
wouldn
justify
me
in
refusing
to
treat
her
where
she
why
the
concern
she
unlikely
to
find
anything
here
to
her
appetite
can
you
be
sure
of
that
she
ll
find
something
and
what
excuse
would
give
for
telling
her
she
can
return
you
wouldn
need
to
her
simply
say
that
there
been
double
and
you
find
you
haven
bed
it
was
difficult
to
control
his
irritation
this
was
an
able
with
the
management
of
his
patients
he
said
candace
what
all
this
about
you
re
usually
rational
this
seems
close
to
she
led
the
way
through
to
the
kitchen
and
began
washing
the
two
mugs
and
the
after
moment
silence
she
said
sometimes
wonder
about
that
myself
admit
it
does
sound
far
and
irrational
anyway
ve
no
right
to
but
don
think
patients
who
come
here
for
privacy
would
be
delighted
to
find
themselves
in
the
company
of
notorious
journalist
but
you
worry
see
her
either
now
or
when
she
not
to
take
kitchen
knife
to
her
frankly
she
not
worth
it
she
saw
him
to
the
door
he
said
see
robin
boyton
is
back
think
helena
did
mention
that
he
booked
in
what
he
here
for
do
you
know
he
said
because
rhoda
gradwyn
is
here
apparently
they
re
friends
and
he
thinks
she
might
like
company
for
stay
of
one
night
does
he
plan
to
book
into
rose
cottage
when
she
if
he
does
he
won
see
her
and
he
won
see
her
now
she
made
it
plain
that
she
coming
here
for
absolute
privacy
and
that
what
ll
ensure
she
gets
closing
the
garden
gate
behind
him
he
wondered
what
all
that
had
been
about
there
must
be
some
strong
personal
reason
for
an
which
seemed
otherwise
was
she
perhaps
on
gradwyn
the
two
years
of
frustration
tied
to
old
man
and
the
prospect
of
losing
her
job
and
now
there
was
marcus
plan
to
go
to
africa
she
might
support
his
decision
but
she
could
hardly
welcome
it
but
striding
back
to
the
manor
he
put
candace
westhall
and
her
out
of
mind
and
concentrated
on
his
own
he
would
find
replacement
for
marcus
and
if
flavia
decided
it
was
time
to
leave
he
would
cope
with
that
too
she
was
getting
restless
there
had
been
signs
which
even
he
busy
as
he
was
had
noticed
perhaps
it
was
time
the
affair
ended
now
with
the
christmas
break
coming
and
the
work
down
he
should
steel
himself
to
end
it
back
at
the
manor
he
decided
to
speak
to
mogworthy
who
would
probably
be
working
in
the
garden
taking
advantage
of
an
uncertain
period
of
winter
sun
there
were
to
be
planted
and
it
was
time
he
showed
an
interest
in
helena
and
mog
plans
for
the
spring
he
passed
through
the
north
door
leading
to
the
and
the
knot
garden
mogworthy
was
nowhere
in
sight
but
he
saw
two
figures
walking
side
by
side
towards
the
gap
in
the
far
hedge
which
led
to
the
rose
garden
the
shorter
was
sharon
her
he
recognised
as
rhoda
gradwyn
so
sharon
was
showing
her
the
garden
task
usually
at
visitor
request
by
helena
or
lettie
he
stood
watching
them
an
odd
couple
as
they
passed
out
of
sight
walking
in
intimacy
obviously
talking
sharon
looking
up
at
her
for
some
reason
the
sight
him
marcus
and
candace
had
irritated
rather
than
worried
him
but
now
for
the
first
time
he
felt
of
anxiety
sense
that
something
and
possibly
dangerous
had
entered
his
the
thought
was
too
irrational
even
to
be
seriously
examined
and
he
thrust
it
aside
but
it
was
odd
that
candace
highly
intelligent
and
usually
so
rational
had
this
obsession
with
rhoda
gradwyn
did
she
perhaps
know
something
about
the
woman
that
he
didn
something
she
was
unwilling
to
reveal
he
decided
not
to
look
for
mogworthy
and
re
entering
the
manor
he
closed
the
door
firmly
behind
him
helena
knew
that
chandler
powell
had
gone
to
stone
cottage
and
was
when
twenty
minutes
after
his
return
candace
arrived
in
the
office
without
she
said
there
something
wanted
to
discuss
with
you
two
things
actually
rhoda
gradwyn
saw
her
arriving
yesterday
at
least
saw
being
driven
past
and
assumed
it
was
hers
when
is
she
leaving
she
isn
at
least
not
today
she
booked
in
for
second
night
and
you
agreed
could
hardly
refuse
not
without
an
explanation
and
there
wasn
one
the
room
was
vacant
phoned
george
and
he
didn
seemed
worried
he
wouldn
be
an
extra
day
income
and
at
no
trouble
to
him
helena
said
and
no
trouble
for
us
either
she
spoke
without
resentment
for
her
george
chandler
powell
was
reasonably
but
she
would
find
time
to
have
word
with
him
about
these
one
was
it
really
necessary
to
have
to
take
preliminary
look
at
the
she
didn
want
the
manor
into
bed
and
breakfast
hotel
on
second
thoughts
perhaps
it
would
be
not
to
raise
the
matter
he
had
always
been
that
patients
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
see
in
advance
where
their
operation
was
to
take
place
he
would
see
any
interference
with
his
judgement
as
their
relationship
had
never
been
clearly
defined
but
both
knew
how
they
stood
he
never
with
her
domestic
running
of
the
manor
she
took
no
part
in
the
clinic
candace
said
and
she
coming
back
so
in
just
over
two
weeks
time
there
was
silence
helena
said
why
do
you
feel
so
strongly
about
it
she
patient
much
like
the
others
she
booked
in
for
week
convalescence
after
surgery
but
doubt
whether
she
ll
stay
the
course
not
in
december
she
ll
probably
want
to
get
back
to
town
whether
she
does
or
not
can
see
her
being
more
of
than
the
other
patients
probably
less
it
on
what
you
mean
by
she
an
investigative
journalist
she
ll
always
be
on
the
for
story
and
if
she
wants
material
for
new
article
she
ll
find
it
even
if
she
does
no
more
than
write
about
the
and
of
some
of
our
patients
after
all
they
re
secrecy
as
well
as
security
don
see
how
you
can
hope
for
secrecy
with
an
investigative
journalist
in
particularly
this
one
helena
said
with
only
herself
and
mrs
skeffington
in
she
hardly
likely
to
encounter
more
than
one
example
of
and
to
write
about
she
thought
but
it
more
than
that
why
should
she
worry
whether
the
clinic
or
once
her
brother
has
gone
she
said
but
with
you
it
personal
isn
it
it
has
to
be
candace
turned
away
helena
regretted
the
sudden
impulse
which
had
the
question
the
two
of
them
worked
well
together
respected
each
other
at
least
now
wasn
the
time
to
start
those
private
which
she
knew
like
her
own
were
by
keep
out
notice
there
was
silence
then
helena
said
you
said
there
were
two
things
ve
asked
george
if
can
stay
on
here
for
another
six
months
perhaps
as
long
as
year
would
continue
to
help
with
the
and
in
the
office
generally
if
you
think
could
be
useful
obviously
once
marcus
has
left
pay
proper
rent
don
want
to
stay
on
if
you
re
not
happy
about
it
ought
to
mention
that
be
here
for
three
days
next
week
to
toronto
to
arrange
some
kind
of
for
grace
the
nurse
who
helped
me
with
father
so
marcus
was
going
it
was
about
time
he
made
up
his
mind
his
loss
would
be
major
inconvenience
for
george
but
no
doubt
he
find
helena
said
we
wouldn
find
it
easy
to
do
without
you
be
grateful
if
you
could
stay
on
at
least
for
time
know
that
lettie
will
feel
the
same
so
you
ve
finished
with
the
university
the
university
has
finished
with
me
there
are
not
enough
students
to
justify
department
saw
it
coming
of
course
they
closed
the
department
last
year
to
forensic
and
now
the
department
is
to
close
and
will
become
religion
when
that
judged
to
be
too
difficult
and
with
our
it
undoubtedly
will
be
then
no
doubt
religion
will
become
religion
and
media
or
religion
and
forensic
the
government
which
of
fifty
of
young
people
going
to
university
and
at
the
same
time
that
forty
are
when
they
leave
school
lives
in
fantasy
world
but
don
let
me
get
on
to
the
subject
of
higher
education
ve
become
bore
about
it
so
helena
thought
she
lost
her
job
is
losing
her
brother
and
is
now
facing
six
months
stuck
in
this
cottage
with
no
clear
idea
of
her
future
looking
at
candace
she
felt
an
of
pity
the
emotion
was
but
surprising
she
couldn
imagine
letting
herself
into
candace
situation
it
was
that
dreadful
old
man
dying
so
slowly
for
two
years
who
had
caused
the
why
hadn
candace
broken
free
of
him
she
had
him
as
as
might
victorian
daughter
but
there
had
been
no
love
it
hadn
needed
any
to
see
that
she
herself
had
kept
away
from
the
cottage
as
much
as
possible
as
indeed
did
most
of
the
staff
but
the
truth
of
what
was
going
on
was
known
by
gossip
and
by
what
they
saw
and
heard
he
had
always
despised
his
daughter
destroyed
her
confidence
as
woman
and
why
with
her
hadn
she
applied
for
job
at
university
instead
of
one
near
the
bottom
of
the
order
had
that
old
made
it
clear
to
her
that
she
deserved
nothing
better
and
he
had
needed
more
care
than
she
could
reasonably
provide
even
with
the
help
of
the
district
nurse
why
hadn
she
put
him
in
nursing
home
he
hadn
been
happy
in
the
one
at
bournemouth
where
his
father
had
been
but
there
were
other
nursing
and
there
was
no
lack
of
family
money
the
old
man
was
to
have
been
left
close
on
eight
million
pounds
by
his
father
who
him
by
only
few
weeks
now
that
probate
had
been
granted
marcus
and
candace
were
five
minutes
later
candace
had
left
helena
thought
over
their
conversation
there
was
something
she
had
not
told
candace
she
couldn
imagine
that
it
was
particularly
important
but
it
might
have
proved
an
added
source
of
irritation
it
would
hardly
have
candace
mood
to
be
told
that
robin
boyton
had
also
booked
himself
in
at
rose
cottage
for
the
day
before
miss
gradwyn
operation
and
the
week
of
her
convalescence
by
eight
clock
on
friday
december
the
operation
on
rhoda
gradwyn
completed
george
chandler
powell
was
alone
in
his
private
sitting
room
in
the
east
wing
it
was
solitude
he
often
sought
at
the
end
of
an
operating
day
and
although
there
had
only
been
one
patient
dealing
with
her
scar
had
been
more
complicated
and
time
consuming
than
he
had
expected
at
seven
kimberley
had
brought
him
light
supper
and
by
eight
clock
evidence
of
the
meal
had
been
removed
and
the
small
dining
table
folded
away
he
could
be
confident
of
two
hours
of
solitude
he
had
seen
his
patient
and
checked
on
her
progress
at
seven
clock
and
would
do
so
again
at
ten
immediately
after
the
operation
marcus
had
left
to
spend
the
night
in
london
and
now
knowing
miss
gradwyn
to
be
in
the
experienced
hands
of
flavia
and
with
himself
on
call
george
chandler
powell
turned
his
mind
to
private
not
least
among
them
was
the
of
on
small
table
before
the
fire
he
the
burning
into
greater
life
checked
they
were
carefully
and
settled
into
his
favourite
chair
dean
had
the
wine
and
chandler
powell
judged
that
in
another
half
hour
it
would
be
right
for
drinking
some
of
the
best
pictures
bought
when
he
the
manor
hung
in
the
great
hall
and
the
library
but
here
were
his
they
included
six
to
him
by
grateful
patient
the
had
been
totally
unexpected
and
it
had
taken
some
time
for
him
to
remember
her
name
he
was
grateful
that
she
had
obviously
shared
his
against
foreign
and
alien
and
all
six
showed
english
three
views
of
of
de
of
and
on
the
opposite
wall
he
had
hung
hills
painting
of
view
in
and
two
one
by
and
study
for
his
of
the
arrival
of
the
english
packet
at
which
was
his
favourite
he
let
his
eyes
rest
on
the
bookcase
with
the
books
he
most
often
promised
himself
to
re
read
some
childhood
others
from
his
grandfather
library
but
now
as
often
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
was
too
tired
to
energy
for
the
satisfaction
of
and
turned
to
music
tonight
particular
pleasure
him
new
of
by
with
his
favourite
glorious
music
as
as
he
was
putting
the
first
into
the
player
when
there
was
knock
on
the
door
he
felt
an
irritation
close
to
anger
very
few
people
disturbed
him
in
his
private
sitting
room
and
knocked
before
he
could
answer
the
door
opened
and
flavia
came
in
the
door
sharply
behind
her
and
leaning
against
it
apart
from
her
cap
she
was
still
in
uniform
and
his
first
words
were
instinctive
miss
gradwyn
is
she
all
right
of
course
she
all
right
if
she
weren
would
be
here
at
six
fifteen
she
said
she
was
hungry
and
ordered
supper
scrambled
egg
and
smoked
followed
by
if
you
re
interested
she
managed
to
get
most
of
it
down
and
seemed
to
enjoy
it
ve
left
nurse
frazer
in
charge
until
return
then
she
ll
be
off
duty
and
will
drive
back
to
wareham
anyway
not
here
to
discuss
miss
gradwyn
nurse
frazer
was
one
of
his
part
time
staff
he
said
if
it
not
urgent
can
it
wait
until
tomorrow
no
george
it
can
not
until
tomorrow
nor
the
day
after
nor
the
day
after
that
not
until
any
day
when
you
to
find
time
to
listen
he
said
will
it
take
much
time
more
time
than
you
are
usually
willing
to
give
he
could
guess
what
was
coming
well
the
future
of
their
affair
had
to
be
settled
sooner
or
later
and
with
his
evening
already
ruined
it
might
as
well
be
now
her
of
resentment
had
become
more
common
of
late
but
had
never
before
occurred
while
they
were
at
the
manor
he
said
ll
get
my
jacket
we
ll
walk
under
the
in
the
dark
and
the
wind
rising
can
we
talk
here
but
he
was
already
fetching
his
jacket
returning
and
putting
it
on
he
patted
the
pocket
for
his
keys
he
said
we
ll
talk
outside
suspect
that
the
discussion
will
be
and
prefer
conversation
to
take
place
outside
this
room
you
better
get
coat
ll
see
you
at
the
door
there
was
no
need
to
which
door
only
that
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
west
wing
led
directly
to
the
and
to
the
lime
walk
she
was
waiting
for
him
and
with
scarf
tied
over
her
head
the
door
was
locked
but
and
he
locked
it
behind
them
they
walked
for
minute
in
silence
which
chandler
powell
had
no
intention
of
breaking
still
annoyed
at
the
loss
of
his
evening
he
was
to
be
helpful
flavia
had
asked
for
this
meeting
if
she
had
anything
to
say
let
her
say
it
it
wasn
until
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
lime
walk
and
after
few
seconds
of
had
turned
back
that
she
stopped
walking
and
faced
him
he
couldn
see
her
face
clearly
but
her
body
was
rigid
and
there
was
and
resolution
in
her
voice
that
he
had
never
heard
before
we
can
go
on
as
we
are
we
have
to
make
decision
asking
you
to
marry
me
so
it
had
come
the
moment
he
had
dreaded
but
it
was
meant
to
be
his
decision
not
hers
he
wondered
why
he
hadn
seen
it
coming
then
realised
that
the
demand
even
in
its
brutal
wasn
totally
unexpected
he
had
chosen
to
the
the
the
sense
of
almost
to
rancour
he
said
calmly
afraid
that
isn
possible
flavia
of
course
it
possible
you
re
divorced
single
mean
that
it
wasn
something
ve
ever
considered
from
the
beginning
our
relationship
was
never
on
that
what
exactly
did
you
think
it
was
on
speaking
of
when
we
first
became
lovers
eight
years
ago
in
case
you
ve
forgotten
on
what
was
it
then
suppose
sexual
respect
affection
know
felt
all
those
things
never
said
loved
you
never
mentioned
marriage
wasn
looking
for
marriage
one
failure
is
enough
no
you
were
always
honest
honest
or
careful
and
you
couldn
even
give
me
could
you
an
attractive
man
distinguished
surgeon
divorced
do
you
think
don
know
how
often
you
ve
on
me
on
my
if
you
like
to
get
rid
of
those
little
gold
who
were
trying
to
get
their
into
you
and
not
talking
about
casual
affair
for
me
it
was
never
that
talking
about
eight
years
of
commitment
tell
me
when
we
re
apart
do
ever
enter
your
mind
do
you
ever
picture
me
except
and
in
the
theatre
your
every
need
knowing
what
you
like
and
what
you
don
like
what
music
you
want
played
while
you
work
available
when
wanted
on
the
of
your
life
not
so
very
different
from
being
in
bed
is
it
but
at
least
in
the
operating
theatre
there
was
no
easy
his
voice
was
calm
but
he
knew
with
some
shame
that
flavia
wouldn
miss
the
clear
note
of
flavia
sorry
sure
ve
been
and
had
no
idea
you
felt
like
this
not
asking
for
pity
spare
me
that
not
even
asking
for
love
you
haven
got
it
to
give
asking
for
justice
want
marriage
the
status
of
being
wife
the
hope
of
children
thirty
six
don
want
to
work
until
and
what
then
using
my
retirement
sum
to
buy
cottage
in
the
country
hoping
the
will
accept
me
or
one
flat
in
london
when
ll
never
be
able
to
afford
decent
address
have
no
ve
neglected
friends
to
be
with
you
to
be
available
when
you
have
time
for
me
he
said
never
asked
you
to
sacrifice
your
life
for
me
that
is
if
you
say
it
sacrifice
but
now
she
went
on
as
