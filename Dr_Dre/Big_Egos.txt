I got mo' class than most of them, ran with the best of them
Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of them
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-a
Where niggas die every day over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll with my shit off safety, for niggas that been hating me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumping gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G
Started from that S.O.B., D.R.E
Like Dub-C I'm rich rolling, pistol holding
Pockets swole nigga, that's how I'm rolling
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
I'm hitting switches, making bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick every time I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watching The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases

Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never faking, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Niggas play this in their Rovers, Jeeps and Regals
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never faking, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Bitches play this in their Benzes, Jeeps and Geos
