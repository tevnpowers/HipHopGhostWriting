La-da-da-da-dahhh
It's the motherfucking D.R.E
Dr. Dre motherfucker
La-da-da-da-dahhh
You know I'm mobbing with the D-O-double-G

Straight off the fucking streets of C-P-T
King of the beats you ride to em in your Fleet (Fleetwood)
Or Coupe DeVille rolling on dubs
How you feeling whoopty whoop nigga what
Dre and Snoop chronic-ed out in the 'llac
With Doc in the back, sipping on 'gnac
Clip in the strap, dipping through hoods
Compton, Long Beach, Inglewood
South Central out to the Westside
It's California Love, this California bud got a nigga gang of pub
I'm on one, I might bail up in the Century Club
With my jeans on, and my team strong
Get my drink on, and my smoke on
Then go home with, something to poke on
Loc it's on for the two-triple-oh
Coming real, it's the next episode
