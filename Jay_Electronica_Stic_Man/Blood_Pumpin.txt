Efficiency of movement
Footwork improvement
Shadow-box tuning to the rhythm of the music
Cardio conditioning
Heart rate pumping up
Metabolism on fire
Body fat burning up
Jumpin rope, open up the lungs full of oxygen
Circulate the blood so the body work optimum
I stay light on my feet like a moccasin
Soaking up the science from the trainers in the boxing gym
Breathing through my nose
Keep my mouth closed
Through the nose, Chi goes where the Tao flows
Never stagnate, move always push the limits
The richest man know his wealth is his health and fitness
I'm a gym junkie
I love the calisthenics
You can't half assed, gotta put you're heart in it
Feel like I'm won the pendant
Feel like Jordan dunk'n
Feel like Tyson in his prime you can't tell me nuttin'
Over my life time I'm trying to do a million crunches
A billion pushups
And probably throw a trillion punches
It's not the numbers
It's all about the drive and hunger
To live strong like the realest thrive in the jungle
Always wanted to be cut when I was younger
The big Homies looking like Koby Scott 'monsters'
Made a soldier wanna step up his gym game
Make em' say homie got heart with the slim frame
