When I walk motherfucker, my uzi weighs a ton
When I talk motherfucker my uzi weights a ton

Never will I resign I'm a soldier for life
I'm mastering my circumference controlling the mic
Behold the light
Some niggas die for their ice
See I'll part with the chain, but I'mma die for the Christ
This time I baptise with fire
Roll with a thousand soldiers like Jeremiah
Call me sire
Hitman for hire
Show me the money like J McGuire
Build my empire in the midst of the fire
Who do men say that I am, I'm a stumbling stone
I'm never too far from home cause the Earth's my throne
I'm the king supreme superb out the third, ya heard
Magnolia made me a soldier throwin dice on the curb
Crucified me the first day, I'm rockin ice on the third
Burning circles on hood corners rocking mics and them birds
I got my hard hat my work gloves, I'm ready to rock
So beware of this heavy hardware, we steady to drop

When I walk motherfucker, my uzi weighs a ton
When I talk motherfucker my uzi weights a ton

Bring seven emcees, put them in a line
Go get seven other cornballs who think they can rhyme
It'll take seven more before I go for mine
That's twelve sucka niggas with a gash in they perm
Plus nine other motherfuckers drastically burned
It's a horrible lesson indeed, but has to get learned
It's the new world order
We kidnapped rap and took her south of the border
While cats rock three-sixty waves, white tees, girbauds, and diodoras
Young guns is raised in the little shop of horror
When drama get to popping and the shit get out of order
The choppers'll chop a hole up in the door of your explorer
The coppers'll pop a hole up in the door of your aurora
Watchers, dime dropper to copper sing them a story
Niggas is shiesty eh? in the land where they trill with it
Stress is a motherfucker, man, nigga deal with it

When I walk motherfucker, my uzi weighs a ton
When I talk motherfucker my uzi weights a ton

Nas gave me some sweet advice, uh huh
He came like a man with it
Took it and ran with it
I'm a turn the rap game to the summer of Sam with it
If anybody asks tell em the son of man did it
That's right, you know my name I got the devil on the run
Why? Cause my motherfuckin uzi weighs a ton
And I'm squeezing on you fuckers with the mic in my hands
That'll be terrorizing rappers from Detroit to Japan
