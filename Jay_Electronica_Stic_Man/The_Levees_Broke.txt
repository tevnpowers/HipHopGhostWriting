I was on the corner with Reem by Tipitina's
He said "Ri, what up my nig, I ain't seen ya since Katrina
Lil' Mikey doin' time for flashin' nines in Pasadena
I tried to tell 'em chill and wait 'til niggas get they cream up
I ain't gonna lie bra, niggas took that petty cash from FEMA
And copped a couple choppers. Why? Cause coppers on the clean up
You ain't know? They hittin' niggas left and right with bids
On the news I seen a family of a grandma and some kids
They tore down where she lived for sixty years and told her here goes
A voucher for some powdered milk and Kleenex for your tears
You seen them tents outside of city hall? That's where they live
A trailer in the park or cardboard box under the bridge
They closed down all the projects
And all these wicked contractors can see us makin' profit
Insurance companies fucked us up the ass, nobody stopped it;
That's why I'm yellin' fuck the world every time I let my Glock spit
My nigga, we ain't got shit
I spent the night in jail three times just cause I lost my ID
I went to pastor Raphael who said 'Son, thou shalt not kill'
And I said 'Why me?'
He told me God gonna try me
And when I left the church I heard the flashin' lights and sirens
They said "Let me see some ID"
I said 'Yeah, sure, I'll oblige thee; here, sir, that's my passport'
They threw me on the gate I said "Man why you gonna do that for?"
They said Cause you the son of slaves, your daddy was a bastard'
I couldn't take no more Jay, click clat sprrat blast blast, that's what they asked for
We laughed he said "Yeah bra, you feel what niggas come from, it's good to see your face again
Tell me what Elijah said 'bout how we came from space again? "
