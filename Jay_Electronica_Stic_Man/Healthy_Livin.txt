Fresh fruit in my blender
Pinch of ginger great blood cleanser
Its the art of good nutrition
No graveyard inside the kitchen
Low salt no hypertension
No junk food goes in my engine
Strictly fruit and veggies
Beans and seeds and nuts and berries pimpin'
No dairy milk I'm pourin'
Its just water, honey, almonds
Wake up early in the morning
Give thanks maybe slice some orange
Drink water stay hydrated
My health I won't violate it
So thankful for my lady
Vegan mash potato gravy
She made it with lots of love
You got those pots on fire baby
Faithful to my dialogue
When we fast, I like it raw!
Coffee causes high cholesterol
And makes you fidget
Food is costly, but
Being sick is more expensive

We are what we eat
It is a natural fact
What we put in
We get back and
It's just simple as that
That's why I promise myself
To stay on top of my health
And not take care of myself
Because my health is my wealth
Healthy livin'
Little bit of food for life
We have to choose wise
What we put inside
Our bodies and mind

The doctors ain't gon' save us
We have to save ourselves
Invest in good prevention
Cause' healthcare is high as hell
RGB fit club prescription;
Knowledge exercise and nutrition
Get exercise and stay consistent
New tradition ancient wisdom
No ac no alcohol
Ital is my protocol
No white sugar no not at all
Diabetes problem solved
Take that candy from the baby
Instead let him have a kiwi
If the kids dont eat their veggies
Then no TV saturday evening
Exercise creates endorphins
Rollerblading, skating, walking
Caution what you put your fork in
Chew it well
And watch your portions
Read the labels
Choose organic
It's good for you and the planet
Children copy from they parents
For the family raise the standards
