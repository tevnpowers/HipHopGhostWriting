While you was blowin' X amount of dollars on a bracelet
The sovereign nation of France was openin' they files on the UFO phenomenon: i.e. spaceships
It's just the facts, Jack may as well face it
Every rhyme I write the seal get cracked in the chapter of Revelations
A atom get cracked in the blackness of meditation
Mysterious shit
Call me Jay Dogon, I'm on some serious shit
Scholars wonder why don't he bust
Allah blessed me with a Midas-y touch
Everything I lay to hands turn to Ethiopian gold: shiny and buffed
I got a firm understandin' on the minus and plus
So I ain't got time to argue with a rapper 'bout how he ain't got rhymes
That's fuckin' with mine's
I'm trying to kill Lucifer, so if I have to brake
Cause a rapper in my face tellin' me that he the great
You can bet a shiny nickel I'll blast his motherfuckin' ass way past Jupiter
You couldn't be stupider
Fuckin' with the nuclear
Mayan, Aztec lion
Asiatic Blackman from Zion
Quetzalcoatl supreme, lettin' off steam
Dimethyltriptamine make a man dream
But y'all would much rather hear me rappin' 'bout trash
The size of Erykah's ass, blunts and cash
We need savin'
Minds are consumed with swine we need bathin'
