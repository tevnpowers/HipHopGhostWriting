Who am I? I’m a champion
I’m a champion. [I'm a champion]
Who am I? I’m a champion
I’m a champion. [I'm a champion]


I stick and move through the madness
Bob and weave the negative
Blockin out the haters
My meditation is medicine

I beat down barriers
And stomp out worries
Gotta keep my guard up
Cuz that drama comes in flurries

It’ll throw you off center
Take your balance off center line
But I know my enemy
The biggest battle is within the mind

Know yourself, build your strength
Learn from weakness
Nothing comes free
Only your sweat earns the secrets

The secret is...
Power exists in all people
The struggle is a sequel
If you learn to let it teach you

The key to, the universe
Is right within our reaches
But we can’t win the game
If we’re standing in the bleachers

Who am I? I’m a champion
I’m a champion. [I'm a champion]
Who am I? I’m a champion
I’m a champion. [I'm a champion]

Who am I? I’m a champion
I’m a champion. [I'm a champion]
Who am I? I’m a champion
I’m a champion. [I'm a champion]

The game is mental
The mind is the head coach
Strength is to youth
What wisdom is to old folks

Focusing
Like a ball going through the goal post
See the goal clear in my mind
Touch it, it’s so close

I aspire for higher
To rise like Horace
Increase my flexibility
My strength and my endurance

I see no opponents
I compete with myself
Training 101
Like I’m in a class by myself

My health is a priority
Winner mentality
All I see is success
And build it up gradually

Step by step
Like two shoes on a treadmill
Got to make moves in this life
Can’t stand still

Who am I? I’m a champion
I’m a champion. [I'm a champion]
Who am I? I’m a champion
I’m a champion. [I'm a champion]

Who am I? I’m a champion
I’m a champion. [I'm a champion]
Who am I? I’m a champion
I’m a champion. [I'm a champion]

Who am I?!? I’m a champion
Who am I?!? I’m a champion
Who am I?!? I’m a champion
Who am I?!? I’m a champion
Who am I?!? I’m a champion
Who am I?!? I’m a champion

The heart, the will, the drive, the skill
The sweat, the work, desire to win

The fate, inside, the focus, the fire
The goal, the struggle, humility, pride

The heart, your will, the drive, the skill
The sweat, the work, desire to win

The fate, inside, the focus, the fire, the fight
The triumphant rise of the champion
