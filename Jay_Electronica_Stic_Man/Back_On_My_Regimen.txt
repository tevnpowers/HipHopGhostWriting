I can get swole like Tookie with it
I can get swole like Tookie with it
I can get swole, I can get swole
I can get swole like Tookie with it

I can get swole like Tookie with it
I can get swole like Tookie with it
I can get swole, I can get swole
I can get swole like Tookie with it

My mind is infinite, I think and grow rich
The gym is my religion, I pray on the bench
The reason why I train: I want the power and the strength
Won't stop, won't quit 'til I'm swole and I'm rip
I cut off the liquor, laid off the spliffs
Had a paradigm shift like I met Morpheus
Now I'm outside the Matrix, back to the basics
Tank top, sweat pants, old pair of Asics
You come to the gym? You got to pay your dues
The body get weak if the body don't move
I train for the street, it's no Queensberry Rules
Got a winner attitude, I feel like I can't lose
Got my game plan set, I'm not the same man
In six months, watch: I'mma be a changed man
Like Heru on my shirt with his wingspan
Raising up the bar like I'm training off a war

I'm back on my work-out, back on my regimen
Back on my weight game, back on my discipline
Back to the gym again, back on my vitamins
Back on my training, feeling stronger then I ever been

I'm back on my work-out, back on my regimen
Back on my weight game, back on my discipline
Back to the gym again, back on my vitamins
Back on my training, feeling stronger then I ever been

No more slacking on my training, I'm a hundred with it
I see the goal in my mind, yes I'm gonna get it
Stress come from within, it's not the outer image
Blood pumping, my set is a game of calisthenics
Slim natural built, but still I handle business
I bang out, I'm insane about my health and fitness
So meantime to go train is all I want for christmas
And I'mma stick to my word like it's a holy scripture
My mind like an ex-con on this regimen
Pump the dumbbells 'til my arms look ignorant
Slowly getting bigger, I'm seeing definition
Flexing in the mirror, my pecs getting thicker
Squats got my cabs and my quads on sizzle
My abs getting chizzled, I've been on my grizzle
I'm loving my training, I'm always on it
Cause I'm building up the body that I always wanted

I'm back on my work-out, back on my regimen
Back on my weight game, back on my discipline
Back to the gym again, back on my vitamins
Back on my training, feeling stronger then I ever been

I'm back on my work-out, back on my regimen
Back on my weight game, back on my discipline
Back to the gym again, back on my vitamins
Back on my training, feeling stronger then I ever been
