Look at this [bitch] smilin' in a nigga face I hate her
I can drill a hole at the Earth's equator
Fill it with dynamite and make another Moon with craters
See you later
She ain't know, that innocent shit with Obi-Wan
Behind a Jedi back can turn Anakin to Vader, [bitch]
Your lack of faith in the Force is disturbin'
And if it wasn't Jack Daniels and Parliament
Lights it would have been murder
My eyes is red like ketchup
Tired of playin' catch up
Layin' on the floor starin' at the dresser
Got on my knees and prayed 'till they bleed
Dear God, I'm a sick motherfucker
I even fooled myself I'm a slick motherfucker
I'm sick of the scandulous livin'
I don't think I'm even equipped for a higher standard of livin'
But if you give him one more chance and forgive him
He'll push that negative gene into oblivion
Here's what I'll do:
Put you in this basket and float you down the Mississippi
Twenty miles from the Bayou
Here's grace, here's style
Have faith cause I'mma try you
My momma introduced me to the scripture
The channel 4 news introduced me to that shit that produced Hitler
I was a young lad: Three Stooges, Superman, Batman, The Riddler
Moonwalk, Windmill, Freeze for the picture
My grandma taught me courage
She told me never let the grizzly bears eat your porridge
Or you'll just be a carcass dying slowly in the forest
I could never thank her for it
But I can slay a devil when I see one
Steady practice mastery of self so not to be one
Life is like a re-run, season after season
Bombs on the train, bombs from the plane
Of disgruntled citizens bein' tried for treason
Whatever
