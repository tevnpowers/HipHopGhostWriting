I know I can, I'm sure I can
Get this dope out my veins
I believe I can, I know I can
I'm sure I can break free from the chains

I can heal, I can change a fight and never give up
I'd made up my mind I can do it and that's what up
I'm a learn I'm a find what I need to help myself
I understand that it's up to me to take care of my health
I'm a prove to the world that I can get back up
On my feet and I'm a do it for myself for me
And for my family, they only want the best for me
They wanna see me in control of my destiny

I know I can, I'm sure I can
Get this dope out my veins
I believe I can, I know I can
I'm sure I can break free from the chains

Ain't no easy way out, but I made it this far
Many days I slip back frustrated cos it's hard
But it's my time now to make the changes in my heart
And I ain't looking back right here today is where I'm a start
I believe in myself, I just made some bad choises
I still love myself and I ain't ready for the coffin
I'm reaching out to my loved ones for they support
And no negative thought is gonna stop me just (watch)

I know I can, I'm sure I can
Get this dope out my veins
I believe I can, I know I can
I'm sure I can break free from the chains

I got things I wonna do in my life I ain't did yet
I know I've been close to the egde but I ain't dead yet
It's never too late to make a change for the better
And I really mean it this time I'm bout to get myself together
I know it's not just me I ain't the only one
Everybody got something that they need to overcome
You ain't gor to smoke crack to be a fiend
A fiend is just somebody whos addicted it can be anything
Too many of us addicted to the American dream
We high from the lies on the TV screen
We drunk from the poison that they teach in the schools
And we junkies from the chemicals we eat in the food

I know I can, I'm sure I can
Get this dope out my veins
I believe I can, I know I can
I'm sure I can break free from the chains
