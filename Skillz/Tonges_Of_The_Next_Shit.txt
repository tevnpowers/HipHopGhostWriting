Mad Skillz and the Immortal, keepin it in the streets
Track back with amnesiac microphone techniques
I see the thunder hear the lightning when I'm writing
MC's are always fighting, I find that shit real inviting
So let's face it, cause as soon as we meet
You and your crew will dissapear like Lee from fuckin Beat Street
Breathtakin words, verbs, and subliminals
Make MC's wanna have cookouts around my genitals
Smackin dice and boobytrappin mics
Watchin MC's try to see me when they know I'm beyond they sights
Mortals with no skills, check the fusion
Yo my style's a gold digger, cause me and her be usin men
Professionals, mass intellectuals
Snatchin the man out your body like a homosexual
I'm kickin style to make the microphone sweat
Cause we on some shit, that the next nigga ain't on yet

Skillz, the ill rapper killer you'll emerge
From a sack with a fucked up body like a caterpillar
What? It's dope if I conceive it
And if you made it then that shit's bound to be paraplegic
So leave it, and fuck what niggas might say
It's time for real niggas to represent, VA the right way
We gets in it and pussy dudes get fried
If you birthin wack rhymes, get yo' motherfuckin tubes tied
