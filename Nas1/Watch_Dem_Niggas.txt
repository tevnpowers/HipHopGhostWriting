They never realized how real Nas is so decisive
It's just the likeness of Isrealites mist that made me write this
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your primetime
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan features the freak shit, my thesis
On how we creep quick, fucking your wife that ain't so secret
It's mandatory see that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my nigga's never handle for me
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face
Hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really it's papers I'm addicted to
Wasn't for rap then I'll be sticking you
The mag inside the triple goose
Face down on the floor's the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam
Just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant

Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

Now how can I perfect this
Living reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to Mona Lisa brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing ninety on the Franklin-D-Roosevelt
No seat belt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one son, niggas is frightened
Secret indictments, as on to one seeking enlightment
My Movado says seven, the God hour that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school not far from the Apollo
My Fuck Tomorrow motto through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato

Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

Some niggas watch you
See you when you think on the low
Ain't hard to spot you, you swore to keep it real after you blow
Three keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough
Them old timers, advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening just bobbing your head
Your Roley shining, thinking to yourself nobody's taking mine
At the same time your ho is getting snatched from behind
Put in the van, where's the hundred grand, script in her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know
You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim
You fucked up somehwere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen sick of yapping
Dump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffin ganja get to your crib, can't find her
Just a reminder shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out
Coulda passed out, your coke was gone, now you assed out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes

Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
