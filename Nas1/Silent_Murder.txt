Murder

It's sort of like the conclusion to "Color Purple"
Niggas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop verses the block, shorties is schooled quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where niggas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia
The cognac plurger plus the trees
But whose the foul one to make his nose take a freeze
And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white fiends and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress, since I got a problem with the law-writers
I kick some more items just to explore horizons
The palm lady dreamt of this day so I'mma play
The crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay

Murder

They say the arms of Nicki Barnes would be enough to blast
A lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas
Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz
Fuck what they teach in class I'mma reach the mass
Strap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics
Livin' practice, out of line niggas get smacked backwards
So wear it if the cap fits, fold it up money and mad clips
A stack right under my matress
To smoke a nigga like a Hugh Brothers. motion picture
Niggas gettin' open cruise, won't be olding niggas
April fools they laugh the jokes on the benches
Cease outside my nigga spoke on his sentence

My right handers never play too close to cameras
It's nighttime scanners circle that allow gamblers
Peace-making niggas pep talk
The peace-makin 'niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew
Time to get this loot countless, 'cuz sun it ain't no youth fountains
Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and Pakistanians is took hostage
Locked up inside a linen closet known for spending pies up
What's the flavour when your neighbors do jake favours?
Lock them real niggas down and lettin fake players
Roam around the project this lyrical logic I dilute
The weak can object the right composite
We're plottin' all murderous schemes
It seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of queens
The palm lady dreamt of this day, so I'mma play
The crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay
