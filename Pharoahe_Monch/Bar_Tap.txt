They don't dig the urgency

Okay, so boom like
I'm at the bar right, I'm at the club
I'm chillin' at the bar
I got my drink, you know I drink my Grey Goose
So I turn around with my drink in my hand
Shorty all over me, you know what I'm sayin?
Everybody lookin at my face like "Yo what you gonna do?" you know what I'm sayin?
So I'm like, yeah I'm lookin at her and like...

Wooo let me adjust myself
She making it hard, I don't trust myself
But you throwin it back, I might bust right here
You dancing like you're really tryin to f*ck right here
If you don't feel that roll of quarters, move that bubble back whole at boarder
And if you turn around and bend, I will show you one and again

She said "who you know how you get a nine in the club?"
I said "that's not a nine ma, that's merely a eight, but if I buy you drink could we go out on a date, cause you sound like you wasn't born inside the empire state"
She said "I'm not from here, it's hot in here, but you're popular, so I'm not secure"
Everywhere she was walking dudes was stoppin her
The smoke was irritating to her occular
I said "your contacts"
She said "huh?"
Give me your contact
I'm going to the bathroom, can you buy me a cognac?
Okay, okay...

Ooh ooh, you sexy (sexy)
Baby won't you let me (let me)
Baby, oohh
Show some secret thangs to you
Ooh ooh, you sexy (sexy)
Baby, won't you let me (let me)
Baby, oohh
All the things you want me to

I got you hennessy n coke, but shoulda got a diet cause if you watching your calories, now where's my hospitality?
And if I got it straight... shiet, what if it's straight?
Cause after a couple of those you start to relate
She dancin' better than savion, workin' her lady charm
Battin' her eyelashes, finaglin' her baby arm
And all up in my space, next day I'm on her myspace, top eight
We contemplatin a hot date
Got poolside flicks for the cool fly blogs, with the rules I kicked about the yuletide logs
She like low cut jeans with the real high clogs and dig music so much she got two iPods
I'm tryin' to make it to third base like A-rod
Throw a couple of guinness stout back just to stay ? now let's just say, I'm tryin' to get horizontal like yesterday, she say..

Ooh ooh, you sexy (sexy)
Baby, won't you let me (let me)
Baby, oohh
Show some secret thangs to you
Ooh ooh, you sexy (sexy)
Baby, won't you let me (let me)
Baby, oohh
All the things you want me to
