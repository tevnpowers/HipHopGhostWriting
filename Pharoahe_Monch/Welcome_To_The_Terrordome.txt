I got so much trouble on my mind, refuse to lose
Here's your ticket (uh), hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black
Attack so I sat and japped, then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mike it (huh)
Hear my favoritism roll "Oh"
Never be a brother like to go solo
Lazer, anastasia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin, forgiven, what I'm givin up
X on the flex (hear me now)
I don't know about later
As for now I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em goin in fear
Rhetoric said, it read just a bit ago
Not quittin, it signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from gettin jerked
Changin some ways, to way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold, never follow the code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows
Cause it's comin from the heart
What I got better get some (um hum)
Hustler of culture
Snakebitten, been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fittin
Respects been givin, how's ya livin?
Now I can't protect a pad off the defect
Check the record of reckon
An intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws
Not my fault that they're fallin off
Known as fair square, throughout my years
So I growl at the livin foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the Terrordome

Come on down (get down)
You can get it, get it, get it, get it
Come on down ...
You can get it, get it, get it, get it

Get down
You can get it, get it, get it, get it

There's a hole in an apple, an apple has been rotten
Scheme like a clan, I plan like Bin Laden
Supreme, screen writer, slit, script editor
Drop the LP, many hit like Hezbollah
7 years later, it's the year of the Gods
United States government is just the facade
The Catholic church got ties with the Mob
I see it all like "The Wizard of Oz"
Now there's a Yellow Brick Road, the fame, riches and cars
If you truly had a brain, you would know who you are
Poison your ventilation, cut your education
Secret information, world domination
Take over reservations
Trigger the energies in the oceans for tsunmais to control the population
Eyes in the sky, hidden observation
If you're over 65 they'll take away your medication
Like give me that (give me that), fall in line (fall in line)
Go to war (go to war), press rewind
Cause when I get mad, I put it down on the pad
Give you somethin that you never had
Controllin, fear of high rollin
God bless your soul and keep livin
Black to the bone, my home is your home
Well welcome to the Terrordome

Come on down (get down)
Get it, get it, get it, get it ...
Come on down
Get it, get it, get it, get it ...
Get it, get it, get it, get it ... (*echoed until end*)
