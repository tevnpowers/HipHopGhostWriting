Rollerskaters celebrate the disco way
Give your feet the freedom
Lets bounce today
Rollerskaters one in front
And one behind
Bounce left bounce right
Its disco time
There ain't no stoppin'
Keep on rockin' to the end of the groove

Disco dancers dancing to the disco beat
'tain't nothin' but a party so stay on yo' feet
Rock left, rock right, to the end of the groove
Music is the answer it really makes you move
Sexy ladies strutting their stuff so well
Laid out in the ladies' styles casting a spell
Watch them rock, to the beat
Feel the body heat
Come on, go on and get down

Rollerskaters celebrate the disco way
Everybody needs hot stuff
Lets bounce today
Rollerskaters one on front and one behind
Bounce left, bounce right
To the end of the groove
This funky kinda music
Oh it makes you wanna move
Rollerskaters one in front and one behind
Bounce left

Go on
