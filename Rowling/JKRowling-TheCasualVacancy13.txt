up
with
the
marco
de
luca
he
had
found
her
crying
about
it
in
the
back
yard
of
the
copper
kettle
that
afternoon
when
he
had
gone
outside
for
smoke
his
loss
andrew
had
said
trying
to
keep
the
delight
out
of
his
voice
and
she
had
and
said
andy
you
little
said
simon
when
andrew
finally
turned
off
the
he
had
been
waiting
to
say
it
for
several
minutes
standing
on
the
dark
landing
staring
through
the
gap
in
the
door
which
was
watching
andrew
himself
in
the
mirror
andrew
jumped
then
laughed
his
good
humour
simon
look
at
you
he
as
andrew
passed
him
on
the
landing
in
his
shirt
and
tie
with
your
you
look
and
you
re
and
did
it
to
you
andrew
feelings
about
what
he
had
done
to
his
father
changed
almost
sometimes
the
guilt
would
bear
down
on
him
everything
but
then
it
would
away
leaving
him
in
his
secret
triumph
tonight
the
thought
of
it
gave
extra
heat
to
the
excitement
burning
beneath
andrew
thin
white
shirt
an
additional
to
the
flesh
caused
by
the
rush
of
evening
air
as
he
sped
on
simon
racing
bike
down
the
hill
into
town
he
was
excited
full
of
hope
gaia
was
available
and
vulnerable
her
father
lived
in
reading
shirley
mollison
was
standing
in
party
dress
outside
the
church
hall
when
he
up
gold
in
the
shapes
of
and
to
the
hello
andrew
she
bike
away
from
the
entrance
please
he
wheeled
it
along
to
the
corner
passing
brand
new
racing
green
parked
feet
away
he
walked
around
the
car
on
his
way
inside
taking
in
the
inner
and
here
andy
andrew
saw
at
once
that
his
boss
good
humour
and
excitement
were
equal
to
his
own
howard
was
striding
down
the
hall
wearing
an
immense
dinner
jacket
he
resembled
there
were
only
five
or
six
other
people
around
the
party
would
not
start
for
twenty
minutes
blue
white
and
gold
had
been
up
everywhere
there
was
massive
table
largely
covered
in
plates
draped
with
tea
and
at
the
top
of
the
hall
middle
aged
setting
up
his
equipment
go
help
maureen
andy
will
you
she
was
laying
out
glasses
at
one
end
of
the
long
table
caught
in
stream
of
light
from
an
lamp
don
you
look
handsome
she
croaked
as
he
approached
she
was
wearing
shiny
dress
that
revealed
every
of
the
body
to
which
unexpected
little
rolls
and
of
flesh
still
clung
exposed
by
the
from
somewhere
out
of
sight
came
small
hi
gaia
was
crouching
over
box
of
plates
on
the
floor
glasses
out
of
boxes
please
andy
said
maureen
and
set
them
up
here
where
we
re
having
the
bar
he
did
as
he
was
told
as
he
the
box
woman
he
had
never
seen
before
approached
carrying
several
bottles
of
these
should
go
in
the
fridge
if
there
is
one
she
had
howard
straight
nose
howard
big
blue
eyes
and
howard
fair
hair
but
his
features
were
softened
by
fat
his
daughter
she
had
to
be
his
daughter
was
yet
with
low
brows
big
eyes
and
chin
she
was
wearing
trousers
and
an
open
necked
shirt
after
the
bottles
onto
the
table
she
turned
away
her
demeanour
and
something
about
the
quality
of
her
made
andrew
sure
that
she
was
the
owner
of
the
outside
that
patricia
whispered
gaia
in
his
ear
and
his
skin
again
as
though
she
carried
an
charge
howard
daughter
yeah
thought
so
he
said
but
he
was
much
more
interested
to
see
that
gaia
was
the
cap
of
bottle
of
and
pouring
out
measure
as
he
watched
she
drank
it
straight
off
with
little
she
had
barely
replaced
the
top
when
maureen
reappeared
beside
them
with
an
ice
bloody
old
said
gaia
as
maureen
walked
away
and
andrew
smelt
the
spirits
on
her
breath
look
at
the
state
of
her
he
laughed
turned
and
stopped
abruptly
because
shirley
was
right
beside
them
smiling
her
smile
has
miss
jawanda
not
arrived
yet
she
asked
she
on
her
way
she
just
me
said
gaia
but
shirley
did
not
really
care
where
sukhvinder
was
she
had
andrew
and
gaia
little
exchange
about
maureen
and
it
had
completely
the
good
mood
that
had
been
by
maureen
delight
in
her
own
it
was
difficult
to
self
so
so
but
as
shirley
walked
away
from
the
teenagers
towards
the
she
planned
what
she
would
say
to
howard
the
next
time
she
saw
him
alone
afraid
the
young
ones
were
well
laughing
at
maureen
it
such
pity
she
wore
that
dress
hate
seeing
her
make
fool
of
herself
there
was
plenty
to
be
pleased
about
shirley
reminded
herself
for
she
needed
little
tonight
she
and
howard
and
miles
were
all
going
to
be
on
the
council
together
it
would
be
simply
she
checked
that
the
knew
that
howard
favourite
song
was
the
green
green
grass
of
home
and
looked
around
for
more
little
jobs
to
do
but
instead
her
gaze
fell
upon
the
reason
that
her
happiness
tonight
had
not
quite
that
perfect
quality
she
had
patricia
was
standing
alone
staring
up
at
the
pagford
coat
of
arms
on
the
wall
and
making
no
effort
to
talk
to
anybody
shirley
wished
that
patricia
would
wear
skirt
sometimes
but
at
least
she
had
arrived
alone
shirley
had
been
afraid
that
the
might
contain
another
person
and
that
absence
was
something
gained
you
weren
supposed
to
dislike
your
own
child
you
were
supposed
to
like
them
no
matter
what
even
if
they
were
not
what
you
wanted
even
if
they
turned
out
to
be
the
kind
of
person
that
you
would
have
crossed
the
street
to
avoid
had
you
not
been
howard
took
large
view
of
the
whole
matter
he
even
about
it
in
mild
way
beyond
patricia
hearing
shirley
could
not
rise
to
those
of
she
felt
to
join
patricia
in
the
vague
unconscious
hope
that
she
might
the
she
was
afraid
everyone
else
would
smell
by
her
own
dress
and
behaviour
do
you
want
drink
darling
not
yet
said
patricia
still
staring
up
at
the
pagford
arms
had
heavy
night
last
night
probably
still
over
the
limit
we
were
out
drinking
with
office
shirley
smiled
vaguely
up
at
the
above
them
fine
thanks
for
asking
said
patricia
oh
good
said
shirley
liked
the
invitation
said
patricia
and
guest
sorry
darling
but
that
just
what
you
put
you
know
when
people
aren
married
ah
that
what
it
says
in
does
it
well
didn
want
to
come
if
she
wasn
even
named
on
the
invitation
so
we
had
massive
row
and
here
am
alone
result
patricia
away
towards
the
drinks
leaving
shirley
little
shaken
behind
her
patricia
had
been
even
as
child
you
re
late
miss
jawanda
she
called
her
as
sukhvinder
came
hurrying
towards
her
in
shirley
opinion
the
girl
was
kind
of
turning
up
at
all
after
what
her
mother
had
said
to
howard
here
in
this
very
hall
she
watched
her
hurry
to
join
andrew
and
gaia
and
thought
that
she
would
tell
howard
that
they
ought
to
let
sukhvinder
go
she
was
and
there
was
probably
issue
with
the
she
was
hiding
under
the
long
black
shirt
shirley
made
mental
note
to
check
whether
it
was
on
her
favourite
medical
website
guests
began
to
arrive
promptly
at
eight
clock
howard
told
gaia
to
come
and
stand
beside
him
and
collect
coats
because
he
wanted
everyone
to
see
him
her
around
by
name
in
that
little
black
dress
and
frilly
apron
but
there
were
soon
too
many
coats
for
her
to
carry
alone
so
he
summoned
andrew
to
help
bottle
gaia
ordered
andrew
as
they
hung
coats
three
and
four
deep
in
the
tiny
and
hide
it
in
the
kitchen
we
can
take
it
in
to
go
and
have
some
ok
said
andrew
gavin
cried
howard
as
his
son
partner
came
through
the
door
alone
at
half
past
eight
kay
not
with
you
gavin
asked
shirley
swiftly
maureen
was
changing
into
behind
the
table
so
there
was
very
little
time
to
march
on
her
no
she
couldn
make
it
said
gavin
then
to
his
horror
he
came
face
to
face
with
gaia
who
was
waiting
to
take
his
coat
mum
could
have
made
it
said
gaia
in
clear
carrying
voice
as
she
glared
at
him
but
gavin
dumped
her
haven
you
gav
howard
clapped
gavin
on
the
shoulder
pretending
he
had
not
heard
and
boomed
great
to
see
you
go
get
yourself
drink
shirley
expression
remained
but
the
of
the
moment
did
not
quickly
and
she
was
little
and
greeting
the
next
few
guests
when
maureen
over
in
her
awful
dress
to
join
the
greeting
party
shirley
took
immense
pleasure
in
telling
her
quietly
we
ve
had
very
awkward
little
scene
very
awkward
gavin
and
gaia
mother
oh
dear
if
we
known
what
what
happened
but
shirley
shook
her
head
the
pleasure
of
maureen
curiosity
and
opened
her
arms
wide
as
miles
samantha
and
lexie
entered
the
hall
here
he
is
parish
councillor
miles
mollison
samantha
watched
shirley
miles
as
though
from
great
distance
she
had
moved
so
abruptly
from
happiness
and
anticipation
to
shock
and
disappointment
that
her
thoughts
had
become
white
noise
against
which
she
had
to
fight
to
take
in
the
world
miles
had
said
that
great
you
can
come
to
dad
party
you
were
only
just
saying
yes
she
had
replied
know
it
is
great
isn
it
but
when
he
had
seen
her
dressed
in
the
jeans
and
band
shirt
she
had
been
herself
in
for
over
week
he
had
been
it
formal
miles
it
the
church
hall
in
pagford
know
but
the
invitation
wearing
this
hello
sammy
said
howard
look
at
you
you
have
dressed
up
but
his
was
as
as
ever
and
he
patted
her
tightly
samantha
gave
shirley
cold
tight
smile
and
walked
past
her
towards
the
drinks
nasty
voice
inside
her
head
was
asking
but
what
did
you
think
was
going
to
happen
at
the
concert
anyway
what
was
the
point
what
were
you
after
nothing
bit
of
fun
the
dream
of
strong
young
arms
and
laughter
which
was
to
have
had
some
kind
of
tonight
her
own
thin
waist
again
and
the
sharp
taste
of
the
new
the
her
fantasy
had
lost
it
was
back
to
earth
only
wanted
to
look
looking
good
sammy
she
had
not
met
her
sister
in
law
for
over
year
like
you
more
than
anyone
else
in
this
family
miles
had
caught
up
with
her
he
kissed
his
sister
how
are
you
how
isn
she
here
no
she
didn
want
to
come
said
patricia
she
was
drinking
but
from
her
expression
it
might
have
been
the
invitation
said
and
guest
are
invited
huge
bloody
row
one
up
to
mum
oh
come
on
said
miles
smiling
oh
fucking
come
on
what
miles
furious
delight
took
hold
of
samantha
to
attack
that
bloody
rude
way
to
invite
your
sister
partner
and
you
know
it
miles
your
mother
could
do
with
some
in
if
you
ask
me
he
was
surely
than
he
had
been
year
ago
she
could
see
his
neck
bulging
over
the
of
his
shirt
his
breath
went
sour
quickly
he
had
little
of
on
his
that
he
had
caught
from
his
father
she
experienced
surge
of
physical
disgust
and
walked
away
to
the
end
of
the
table
where
andrew
and
sukhvinder
were
busy
and
handing
out
glasses
have
you
got
any
samantha
asked
give
me
big
one
she
barely
recognized
andrew
he
poured
her
measure
trying
not
to
look
at
her
breasts
exposed
in
the
shirt
but
it
was
like
trying
not
to
in
direct
sunlight
do
you
know
them
samantha
asked
after
half
glass
of
and
had
before
andrew
could
his
thoughts
to
his
horror
she
gave
and
said
the
band
talking
about
the
band
yeah
yeah
ve
heard
of
them
don
not
my
kind
of
thing
is
that
right
she
said
throwing
back
the
rest
of
her
drink
ll
have
another
one
of
those
please
she
realized
who
he
was
the
boy
from
the
delicatessen
his
uniform
made
him
look
older
maybe
couple
of
weeks
of
up
and
down
the
steps
had
built
some
oh
look
said
samantha
figure
heading
away
from
her
into
the
growing
crowd
there
gavin
the
second
most
boring
man
in
pagford
after
my
husband
obviously
she
strode
off
pleased
with
herself
holding
her
new
drink
the
had
hit
her
where
she
most
needed
it
and
at
the
same
time
and
as
she
walked
she
thought
he
liked
my
let
see
what
he
thinks
of
my
gavin
saw
samantha
coming
and
tried
to
her
by
somebody
else
conversation
anybody
the
nearest
person
was
howard
and
he
himself
hastily
into
the
group
around
his
took
risk
howard
was
saying
to
three
other
men
he
was
and
little
had
down
the
front
of
his
jacket
took
risk
and
put
in
the
simple
as
that
no
nobody
handed
me
oh
here
sammy
who
are
those
young
men
samantha
while
four
elderly
men
stared
at
the
group
stretched
across
her
breasts
samantha
turned
to
gavin
hi
she
said
leaning
in
and
forcing
him
to
kiss
her
kay
not
here
no
said
gavin
shortly
talking
about
business
sammy
said
howard
happily
and
samantha
thought
of
her
shop
failed
and
finished
was
self
he
informed
the
group
what
was
clearly
an
established
that
all
there
is
to
it
that
all
you
need
was
self
massive
and
he
was
like
sun
satisfaction
and
his
were
already
rounded
and
by
the
brandy
in
his
hand
was
ready
to
take
risk
could
ve
lost
everything
well
your
mum
could
have
lost
everything
samantha
him
didn
her
house
to
put
up
half
the
on
the
shop
she
saw
the
tiny
in
howard
eyes
but
his
smile
remained
constant
all
credit
to
my
mother
then
he
said
for
working
and
and
and
giving
her
son
start
what
was
given
and
give
back
to
the
family
pay
for
your
girls
to
go
to
st
anne
what
goes
round
comes
round
sammy
she
expected
this
from
shirley
but
not
from
howard
both
of
them
drained
their
glasses
and
samantha
watched
gavin
away
without
trying
to
stop
him
gavin
was
wondering
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
slip
out
he
was
nervous
and
the
noise
was
making
it
worse
horrible
idea
had
taken
possession
of
him
since
meeting
gaia
at
the
door
what
if
kay
had
told
her
daughter
everything
what
if
the
girl
knew
that
he
was
in
love
with
mary
fairbrother
and
told
other
people
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
sixteen
year
old
might
do
the
very
last
thing
he
wanted
was
for
pagford
to
know
that
he
was
in
love
with
mary
before
he
had
chance
to
tell
her
himself
he
had
imagined
doing
it
months
and
months
perhaps
year
down
the
line
letting
the
first
anniversary
of
barry
death
slip
by
and
in
the
mean
time
the
tiny
of
trust
and
that
were
already
there
so
that
the
reality
of
her
feelings
gradually
upon
her
as
they
had
upon
him
you
haven
got
drink
gav
said
miles
that
situation
must
be
he
led
his
partner
firmly
to
the
drinks
table
and
poured
him
beer
talking
all
the
while
and
like
howard
giving
off
an
almost
visible
glow
of
happiness
and
pride
you
heard
won
the
seat
gavin
had
not
but
he
did
not
feel
equal
to
surprise
yeah
how
mary
asked
miles
he
was
friend
to
the
whole
town
tonight
because
it
had
him
she
doing
ok
yeah
think
heard
she
might
be
going
to
might
be
for
the
best
what
said
gavin
sharply
maureen
was
saying
this
morning
apparently
mary
sister
trying
to
persuade
mary
to
go
home
with
the
kids
she
still
got
lot
of
family
in
this
is
her
home
think
it
was
barry
who
liked
pagford
not
sure
mary
will
want
to
stay
without
him
gaia
was
watching
gavin
through
in
the
kitchen
door
she
was
clutching
paper
cup
containing
several
fingers
of
the
that
andrew
had
stolen
for
her
he
such
bastard
she
said

andrew
who

additional
sandwiches

an
almost
empty
behind
her
could
hardly
believe
that
she
was
using
words
like
the
gaia
who
filled
his
fantasies
was
and
he
did
not
know
what
the
real
gaia
had
done
or
not
done
with
marco
de
luca
her
judgement
on
her
mother
made
it
sound
as
if
she
knew
how
men
after
sex
if
they
were
interested
drink
something
she
told
andrew
as
he
approached
the
door
with
the
and
she
held
up
her
own
cup
to
his
lips
and
he
drank
some
of
her
giggling
little
she
backed
away
to
let
him
out
and
called
after
him
make
come
in
here
and
get
some
the
hall
was
crowded
and
andrew
put
the
pile
of
fresh
sandwiches
on
the
table
but
interest
in
the
food
seemed
to
have
sukhvinder
was
struggling
to
keep
up
with
demand
at
the
drinks
table
and
many
people
had
started
pouring
their
own
gaia
wants
you
in
the
kitchen
andrew
told
sukhvinder
and
he
took
over
from
her
there
was
no
point
acting
like
instead
he
filled
as
many
glasses
as
he
could
find
and
left
them
on
the
table
for
people
to
help
themselves

said
and
she
laughed
her
breasts

and

voice
through
the
and
everyone
stopped
talking
to
listen
to
howard

words
most
of

by
now
that

startled
to

quite
clearly
under
her
breath

nobody
was
coming
for
drinks
now
andrew
slipped
back
into
the
kitchen
gaia
and
sukhvinder
were
alone
in
there

and
laughing
and
when
they
saw

and
pushed
the
door
open
the
first
few
bars
of
the
green
green
grass
of
home
out
and
then
in
howard
and
maureen
the
old
home
town
looks
the
same
as
step
down
from
the
train
gavin
was
the
only
one
who
heard
the
and
but
when
he
turned
around
all
he
saw
were
the
double
doors
to
the
kitchen
swinging
little
on
their
miles
had
left
to
chat
with
aubrey
and
julia
fawley
who
had
arrived
late
in
polite
smiles
gavin
was
in
the
grip
of
familiar
mixture
of
dread
and
anxiety
his
brief
of
freedom
and
happiness
had
been
by
the
twin
threats
of
gaia
what
he
had
said
to
her
mother
and
of
mary
leaving
pagford
for
ever
what
was
he
going
to
do
down
the
lane
walk
with
my
sweet
mary
hair
of
gold
and
lips
like
kay
not
here
samantha
had
arrived
leaning
against
the
table
beside
him
you
already
asked
me
that
said
gavin
no
everything
ok
with
you
two
is
that
really
any
of
your
business
it
slipped
out
of
him
before
he
could
stop
it
he
was
sick
of
her
constant
and
for
once
it
was
just
the
two
of
them
miles
was
still
busy
with
the
fawleys
she
over
acted
being
taken
aback
her
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
her
speech
was
for
the
first
time
gavin
felt
more
dislike
than
sorry
was
only
asking
yeah
he
said
as
howard
and
maureen
arm
in
arm
like
to
see
you
settled
down
you
and
kay
seemed
good
together
yeah
well
like
my
freedom
said
gavin
don
know
many
happily
married
samantha
had
drunk
too
much
to
feel
the
full
force
of
the
but
she
had
the
impression
that
one
had
been
made
are
always
mystery
to
she
said
carefully
nobody
can
ever
really
know
except
the
two
people
involved
so
you
shouldn
judge
gavin
thanks
for
the
he
said
and
irritated
past
he
set
down
his
empty
beer
can
and
headed
towards
the
samantha
watched
him
leave
sure
that
she
had
had
the
best
of
the
encounter
and
turned
her
attention
to
her
mother
in
law
whom
she
could
see
through
gap
in
the
crowd
watching
howard
and
maureen
samantha
shirley
anger
which
was
expressed
in
the
smile
she
had
worn
all
evening
howard
and
maureen
had
performed
together
many
time
over
the
years
howard
loved
to
and
maureen
had
once
performed
for
local
band
when
the
song
finished
shirley
clapped
her
hands
together
once
she
might
have
been
and
samantha
laughed
out
loud
and
moved
along
to
the
bar
end
of
the
table
which
she
was
disappointed
to
find
by
the
boy
in
the
tie
andrew
gaia
and
sukhvinder
were
still
in
the
kitchen
they
laughed
because
of
howard
and
maureen
and
because
they
had
finished
two
of
the
but
mostly
they
laughed
because
they
laughed
off
each
other
until
they
could
barely
stand
the
little
window
over
the
sink
propped
so
that
the
kitchen
did
not
become
too
rattled
and
and
fats
head
appeared
through
it
evening
he
said
he
had
climbed
onto
something
outside
because
with
noise
of
and
heavy
object
falling
over
more
and
more
of
him
emerged
through
the
window
until
he
landed
heavily
on
the
board
knocking
several
glasses
to
the
ground
where
they
shattered
sukhvinder
walked
straight
out
of
the
kitchen
andrew
knew
immediately
that
he
did
not
want
fats
there
only
gaia
seemed
still
giggling
she
said

doors
into
the
hall

the
mumbled
gaia
and
she
the
bottle
back
under
the
sink
and
left
the
kitchen
too
andrew
followed
sukhvinder
had
returned
to
the
bar
area
gaia
was
into
the
bathroom
and
fats
was
leaning
against
the
table
with
beer
in
one
hand
and
sandwich

and
the
guests

drunk
that
nobody
seemed
to
care
where
andrew
went
any
more
when
they
got
outside
they
found
patricia
mollison
alone
beside
her
car
looking
up
at
the
clear
sky
smoking
you
can
have
one
of
these
she
said
offering
her
packet
if
you
want
after
she
had
lit
their
cigarettes
she
stood
at
her
ease
with
one
hand
deep
in
her
pocket
there
was
something
about
her
that
andrew
found
intimidating
he
could
not
even
bring
himself
to
glance
at
fats
to
his
reaction
she
told
them
after
little
while
howard
and
shirley
daughter
hi
said
andrew
andrew
stuart
said
fats
she
did
not
seem
to
need
to
conversation
andrew
felt
it
as
kind
of
compliment
and
tried
to
her
indifference
the
silence
was
broken
by
footsteps
and
the
sound
of
muffled
girls
voices
gaia
was
dragging
sukhvinder
outside
by
the
hand
she
was
laughing
and
andrew
could
tell
that
the
full
effect
of
the
was
still
inside
her
you
said
gaia
to

gaia
onto
the
for
support
calling
her

stuff

patricia
her
eyes
through
the
smoke
she

say
that
andrew
saw

said
there
was
anything
wrong
with
it
it
only
jokes
he
said
gaia
slid
down
the
to
sit
on
the
pavement
her
head
in
her
arms

andrew
asked
if

not

would
have

muttered

patricia
asked
gaia
who
nodded
with
her
face
still
hidden
what
was
it
the
drink
or
the
that
made
you
feel
sick
andrew
laughed
little
bit
out
of
and
because
he
wanted
to
keep
the
subject
away
from
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
turned
my
stomach
too
said
patricia
old
maureen
and
my
father
singing
along
together
arm
in

patricia
took
final
drag
on
her
cigarette
and
threw

beneath
her

when

he
gave

and
fats
stood
scared
even
to
look
at
each
other
patricia
wiped
her
face
on
the
back
of
her
hand
she
was
crying
shouldn
have

she
said

she
got
into
the
and
the
two
boys
watched
stunned
as
she
turned
on
the
engine
out
of
her
parking
space
and
drove
away
into
the
night

message
sukhvinder

whispered
gaia
andrew
left
her
there
the
din
in
the
hall
hit
him
as
he
opened
the
inner
doors
the
disco
was
in
full
swing
he
had
to
move
aside
to
aubrey
and
julia
fawley
room
to
leave
both
with
their
backs
to
the
party
looked
pleased
to
be
going
samantha
mollison
was
not
dancing
but
was
leaning
up
against
the
table
where
so
recently
there
had
been
rows
and
rows
of
drinks
while
sukhvinder
around
glasses
andrew
the
last
box
of
clean
ones
set
them
out
and
filled
them
your
tie
samantha
told
him
and
she
leaned
across
the
table
and
straightened
it
for
him
embarrassed
he
into
the
kitchen
as
soon
as
she
let
go
between
each
of
glasses
he
put
in
the
andrew
took
another
of
the
he
had
stolen
he
wanted
to
be
drunk
like
gaia
he
wanted
to
return
to
that
moment
when
they
had
been
laughing
uncontrollably
together
before
fats
had
appeared
after
ten
minutes
he
checked
the
drinks
table
again
samantha
was
still
propped
up
against
it
eyed
and
there
were
plenty
of
fresh
poured
drinks
left
for
her
to
enjoy
howard
was
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
sweat
pouring
down
his
face
with
laughter
at
something
maureen
had
said
to
him
andrew
wound
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
back
outside
he
could
not
see
where
she
was
at
first
then
he
spotted
them
gaia
and
fats
were
locked
together
ten
yards
away
from
the
door
leaning
up
against
the
bodies
pressed
tight
against
each
other
working
in
each
other
mouths
look
sorry
but
can
do
it
all
said
sukhvinder
desperately
from
behind
him
then
she
spotted
fats
and
gaia
and
let
out
something
between
and
sob
andrew
walked
back
into
the
hall
with
her
completely
in
the
kitchen
he
poured
the
of
the
into
glass
and
it
in
one
he
filled
the
sink
and
set
to
washing
out
the
glasses
that
could
not
fit
in
the
the
alcohol
was
not
like
it
made
him
feel
empty
but
also
keen
to
hit
someone
fats
for
after
while
he
realized
that
the
plastic
clock
on
the
kitchen
wall
had
from
midnight
to
one
and
that
people
were
leaving
he
was
supposed
to
find
coats
he
tried
for
while
but
then
off
to
the
kitchen
again
leaving
sukhvinder
in
charge
samantha
was
leaning
up
against
the
fridge
on
her
own
with
glass
in
her
hand
andrew
vision
was
strangely
like
series
of
gaia
had
not
come
back
she
was
doubtless
long
gone
with
fats
samantha
was
talking
to
him
she
was
drunk
too
he
was
not
embarrassed
by
her
any
more
he
suspected
that
he
might
be
sick
quite
soon
hate
bloody
pagford
said
samantha
and
but
you
re
young
enough
to
get
out
yeah
he
said
unable
to
feel
his
lips
an
will
will
she
pushed
his
hair
off
his
forehead
and
called
him
sweet
the
image
of
gaia
with
her
tongue
in
fats
mouth
threatened
to
everything
he
could
smell
samantha
coming
in
waves
from
her
hot
skin
that
band
shit
he
said
pointing
at
her
chest
but
he
did
not
think
she
heard
him
her
mouth
was
and
warm
and
her
breasts
were
huge
pressed
against
his
chest
her
back
was
as
broad
as
his
what
the
fuck
andrew
was
slumped
against
the
board
and
samantha
was
being
dragged
out
of
the
kitchen
by
big
man
with
short
greying
hair
andrew
had
dim
idea
that
something
bad
had
happened
but
the
strange
flickering
quality
of
reality
was
becoming
more
and
more
pronounced
until
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
across
the
room
to
the
bin
and
throw
up
again
and
again
and
again
sorry
you
can
come
in
he
heard
sukhvinder
tell
someone
stuff
piled
up
against
the
door
he
tied
the
bin
bag
tightly
on
his
own
vomit
sukhvinder
helped
him
clear
the
kitchen
he
needed
to
throw
up
twice
more
but
both
times
managed
to
get
to
the
bathroom
it
was
nearly
two
clock
by
the
time
howard
sweaty
but
smiling
them
and
said
goodnight
very
good

the
darkness
the
long
cold

how
to

at

and
he
led
the
way
to
the
computer
iv
blue
sky
stretched
like
over
pagford
and
the
fields
light
shone
upon
the
old
stone
war
memorial
in
the
square
on
the
cracked
of
foley
road
and
turned
the
white
walls
of
hilltop
house
pale
gold
as
ruth
price
climbed
into
her
car
ready
for
another
long
at
the
hospital
she
looked
down
at
the
river
shining
like
silver
in
the
distance
and
felt
how
completely
it
was
that
somebody
else
would
soon
have
her
house
and
her
view
mile
below
in
church
row
samantha
mollison
was
still
sound
asleep
in
the
spare
bedroom
there
was
no
lock
on
the
door
but
she
had
it
with
an
armchair
before
dressed
onto
the
bed
the
of
vicious
disturbed
her
and
the
of
sunshine
that
had
the
gap
in
the
curtains
fell
like
across
the
corner
of
one
eye
she
little
in
the
of
her
dry
anxious
half
sleep
and
her
dreams
were
guilty
and
strange
downstairs
among
the
clean
bright
of
the
kitchen
miles
sat
bolt
upright
and
alone
with
an
mug
of
tea
in
front
of
him
staring
at
the
fridge
and
again
in
his
mind
eye
upon
his
wife
locked
in
the
of
sixteen
year
old
schoolboy
howard
mollison
was
sleeping
and
happily
in
his
double
bed
the
patterned
curtains
him
with
pink
and
protected
him
from
rude
but
his
rattling
wheezing
had
roused
his
wife
shirley
was
eating
toast
and
drinking
coffee
in
the
kitchen
wearing
her
glasses
and
her
dressing
gown
she
maureen
arm
in
arm
with
her
husband
in
the
village
hall
and
experienced
concentrated
that
took
the
taste
from
every
mouthful
in
the
few
miles
outside
pagford
gavin
hughes
himself
under
hot
shower
and
wondered
why
he
had
never
had
the
courage
of
other
men
and
how
they
managed
to
make
the
right
choices
among
almost
there
was
yearning
inside
him
for
life
he
had
glimpsed
but
never
yet
he
was
afraid
choice
was
dangerous
you
had
to
all
other
when
you
chose
kay
bawden
was
lying
awake
and
exhausted
in
bed
in
hope
street
listening
to
the
early
morning
quiet
of
pagford
and
watching
gaia
who
was
asleep
beside
her
in
the
double
bed
pale
and
drained
in
the
early
daylight
there
was
next
to
gaia
on
the
floor
placed
there
by
kay
who
had
half
carried
her
daughter
from
bathroom
to
bedroom
in
the
early
hours
after
holding
her
hair
out
of
the
toilet
for
an
hour
why
did
you
make
us
come
here
gaia
had
as
she
and
over
the
bowl
get
off
me
get
off
fuck
hate
you
kay
watched
the
sleeping
face
and
recalled
the
beautiful
little
baby
who
had
slept
beside
her
sixteen
years
ago
she
remembered
the
tears
that
gaia
had
shed
when
kay
had
split
up
with
her
live
in
partner
of
eight
years
had
attended
gaia
parents
evenings
and
taught
her
to
kay
remembered
the
fantasy
she
had
with
as
silly
as
four
year
old
gaia
wish
for
that
she
would
settle
down
with
gavin
and
give
gaia
at
last
and
beautiful
house
in
the
country
how
desperate
she
had
been
for
ending
and
life
to
which
gaia
would
always
want
to
return
because
her
daughter
departure
was
towards
kay
like
and
she
the
loss
of
gaia
as
that
would
her
world
kay
reached
out
hand
beneath
the
duvet
and
held
gaia
the
feel
of
the
warm
flesh
that
she
had
accidentally
brought
into
the
world
made
kay
start
to
quietly
but
so
violently
that
the
mattress
shook
and
at
the
bottom
of
church
row
parminder
jawanda
slipped
coat
on
over
her
and
took
her
coffee
into
the
back
garden
sitting
in
the
sunlight
on
wooden
she
saw
that
it
was
to
be
beautiful
day
but
there
seemed
to
be
between
her
eyes
and
her
heart
the
heavy
weight
on
her
chest
everything
the
news
that
miles
mollison
had
won
barry
seat
on
the
parish
council
had
not
been
surprise
but
on
seeing
shirley
neat
little
on
the
website
she
had
known
another
of
that
that
had
her
at
the
last
meeting
desire
to
attack
almost
at
once
by
going
to
from
the
council
she
told
vikram
what
the
point
but
you
like
it
he
had
said
she
had
liked
it
when
barry
had
been
there
too
it
was
easy
to
him
up
this
morning
when
everything
was
quiet
and
still
little
bearded
man
she
had
been
taller
than
him
by
half
head
she
had
never
felt
the
slightest
physical
towards
him
what
was
love
after
all
thought
parminder
as
gentle
breeze
the
tall
hedge
of
that
the
jawandas
big
back
lawn
was
it
love
when
somebody
filled
space
in
your
life
that
inside
you
once
they
had
gone
did
love
laughing
thought
parminder
really
miss
laughing
and
it
was
the
memory
of
laughter
that
at
last
made
the
tears
flow
from
her
eyes
they
down
her
nose
and
into
her
coffee
where
they
made
little
swiftly
she
was
crying
because
she
never
seemed
to
laugh
any
more
and
also
because
the
previous
evening
while
they
had
been
listening
to
the
distant
of
the
disco
in
the
church
hall
vikram
had
said
why
don
we
visit
this
summer
the
golden
the
of
the
religion
to
which
he
was
she
had
known
at
once
what
vikram
was
doing
time
lay
slack
and
empty
on
her
hands
as
never
before
in
her
life
neither
of
them
knew
what
the
would
decide
to
do
with
her
once
it
had
considered
her
towards
howard
mollison
says
it
big
she
had
replied
at
stroke
sukhvinder
had
crossed
the
lawn
without
parminder
noticing
she
was
dressed
in
jeans
and
parminder
hastily
wiped
her
face
and
at
sukhvinder
who
had
her
back
to
the
sun
don
want
to
go
to
work
today
parminder
responded
at
once
in
the
same
spirit
of
that
had
made
her
turn
down
you
ve
made
commitment
sukhvinder
don
feel
well
you
mean

re
tired
you
re
the
one
who
wanted
this
job
now
you

but

re
going
to
work
snapped
parminder
and
she
might
have
been
sentence
you
re
not
giving
the
mollisons
another
reason
to
after
sukhvinder
walked
back
to
the
house
parminder
felt
guilty
she
almost
called
her
daughter
back
but
instead
she
made
mental
note
that
she
must
try
and
find
time
to
sit
down
with
her
and
talk
to
her
without
krystal
was
walking
along
foley
road
in
the
early
morning
sunlight
eating
it
was
an
unfamiliar
taste
and
and
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
terri
and
krystal
never
bought
fruit
nikki
mother
had
just
her
out
of
the
house

for
dinner
as
an
she
had
handed
krystal
the
to
eat
for
breakfast
krystal
had
left
without
protest
there
was
barely
enough
room
for
nikki
family
around
the
kitchen
table
the
fields
were
not
by
sunshine
which
merely
showed
up
the
dirt
and
the
damage
the
in
the
walls
the
boarded
windows
and
the
the
square
in
pagford
looked
freshly
painted
whenever
the
sun
shone
twice
year
the
primary
school
children
had
walked
through
the
middle
of
town
on
their
way
to
church
for
christmas
and
services
nobody
had
ever
wanted
to
hold
krystal
hand
fats
had
told
them
all
that
she
had
she
wondered
whether
he
remembered
there
had
been
hanging
full
of
flowers
of
purple
pink
and
green
and
every
time
krystal
had
passed
one
of
the
planted
outside
the
black
canon
she
had
pulled
off
each
one
had
been
cool
and
slippery
in
her
fingers
swiftly
becoming
and
brown
as
she
clutched
it
and
she
usually
wiped
it
off
on
the
of
warm
wooden
in
st
michael
she
let
herself
into
her
house
and
saw
at
once
through
the
open
door
to
her
left
that
terri
had
not
gone
to
bed
she
was
sitting
in
her
armchair
with
her
eyes
closed
and
her
mouth
open
krystal
closed
the
door
with
but
terri
did
not
stir
krystal
was
at
terri
side
in
four
shaking
her
thin
arm
terri
head
fell
forwards
onto
her
shrunken
chest

krystal
let
go
of
her
the
vision
of
dead
man
in
the
bathroom
back
into
her
silly
bitch

said
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
robbie
was
not
there
she
pounded
up
the
stairs
shouting
for
him
ere
she
heard
him
say
from
behind
her
own
closed
bedroom
door
when
she
it
open
she
saw
robbie
standing
there
naked
behind
him
scratching
his
bare
chest
lying
on
her
own
mattress

obbo
all
righ

said
grinning
she
seized
robbie
and
pulled
him
into
his
own
room

hands
so
badly
that
it
took
her
ages
to
dress

whispered
to

robbie
when
he
was
dressed
she
picked
him
up
and
ran
downstairs
she
could
hear
obbo
moving
around
in
her
bedroom
why
ere
she
shouted
at
terri
who
was
awake
in
her
chair
why
with
robbie
robbie
fought
to
get
out
of
her
arms
he
hated
shouting
an
wha

fuck
that
screamed
krystal
for
the
first
time
two
black
lying
beside
terri
armchair
nuthin
said
terri
vaguely
but
krystal
had
already
forced
one
of
the
open
nuthin
shouted
terri
big
brick
like
of
wrapped
neatly
in
sheets
of
krystal
who
could
barely
read
who
could
not
have
identified
half
the
vegetables
in
who
could
not
have
named
the
prime
knew
that
the
contents
of
the
bag
if
discovered
on
the
meant
for
her
mother
then
she
saw
the
tin
with
the
and
on
the
lid
half
from
the
chair
on
which
terri
was
sitting
yeh

used
said
krystal
breathlessly
as
disaster
around
her
and
everything
collapsed
yeh

fuckin
she
heard
obbo
on
the
stairs
and
she
snatched
up
robbie
again
he
and
struggled
in
her
arms
frightened
by
her
anger
but
krystal
grip
was
fuckin
go
called
terri
krystal
had
opened
the
front
door
and
was
running
as
fast
as
she
could
by
robbie
who
was
and
back
along
the
road
vi
shirley
showered
and
pulled
clothes
out
of
the
wardrobe
while
howard
slept
on
the
church
bell
of
st
michael
and
all
saints
ringing
for
ten
clock
reached
her
as
she
up
her
cardigan
she
always
thought
how
loud
it
must
be
for
the
jawandas
living
right
opposite
and
hoped
that
it
struck
them
as
loud
of
pagford
to
the
old
ways
and
of
which
they
so
were
not
part
automatically
because
it
was
what
she
so
often
did
shirley
walked
along
the
hall
turned
into
patricia
old
bedroom
and
sat
down
at
the
computer
patricia
ought
to
be
here
sleeping
on
the
sofa
bed
that
shirley
had
made
up
for
her
it
was
relief
not
to
have
to
deal
with
her
this
morning
howard
who
had
still
been
the
green
green
grass
of
home
when
they
arrived
at
in
the
early
hours
had
not
realized
that
patricia
was
absent
until
shirley
had
had
the
key
in
the
front
door
where
he
had
leaning
against
the
porch
oh
she
was
upset
that
didn
want
to
come
sighed
shirley
they
had
row
or
something
expect
she
gone
home
to
try
and
patch
things
up
never
moment
said
howard
lightly
off
walls
of
the
narrow
hallway
as
he
his
way
carefully
towards
the
bedroom
shirley
brought
up
her
favourite
medical
website
when
she
typed
in
the
first
letter
of
the
condition
she
wished
to
investigate
the
site
offered
its
explanation
of
again
so
shirley
swiftly
their
use
and
content
because
she
might
yet
have
an
opportunity
to
save
their
life
next
she
carefully
typed
in
and
learned
somewhat
to
her
disappointment
that
the
condition
was
not
and
could
not
therefore
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
sack
sukhvinder
jawanda
from
force
of
habit
she
then
typed
in
the
address
of
the
pagford
parish
council
website
and
clicked
onto
the
message
board
she
had
grown
to
recognize
at
glance
the
shape
and
length
of
the
name
just
as
lover
knows
at
once
the
back
of
their
head
or
the
set
of
their
shoulders
or
the
of
their
walk
single
glimpse
at
the
message
excitement
he
had
not
her
she
had
known
that
dr
jawanda
could
not
go
affair
of
the
first
of
pagford
she
read
it
but
did
not
at
first
understand
she
had
been
expecting
to
see
parminder
name
she
read
it
again
and
gave
the
of
woman
being
hit
by
icy
water
howard
mollison
first
of
pagford
and
long
standing
resident
maureen
lowe

it
but
other
people
would
they
would
believe
the
ghost
everybody
believed
him
her
hands
were
like
empty
gloves
and
as
she
tried
with
many
to
remove
the
message
from
the
site
every
second
that
it
remained
there
somebody
else
might
be
reading
it
it
laughing
about
it
passing
it
to
the
local
newspaper
howard
and
maureen
howard
and
maureen
the
message
was
gone
shirley
sat
and
stared
at
the
computer
monitor
her
thoughts
like
in
glass
bowl
trying
to
escape
but
there
was
no
way
out
no
firm
no
way
of
back
to
the
happy
place
she
had
occupied
before
she
saw
that
dreadful
thing
written
in
public
for
the
world
to
see
he
had
laughed
at

had
laughed
at

the
room
with
her
and
glass
wine
shirley
could
not
bear
dirty
laughter
she
had
never
been
able
to
bear
or
she
jumped
up
over
the
chair
legs
and
hurried
back
to
the
bedroom
howard
was
still
asleep
lying
on
his

samantha
was
driven
from
the
spare
room
at
last
by
her
urgent
need
to
she
drank
cold
water
from
the
in
the
bathroom
until
she
felt
sick
down
two
from
the
cabinet
over
the
sink
then
took
shower
she
dressed
without
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
through
everything
she
did
she
was
alert
for
some
noise
that
would
the
of
miles
but
the
house
seemed
to
be
silent
perhaps
she
thought
he
had
taken
lexie
out
somewhere
away
from
her
mother
he
was
in
lexie
class
at
school
miles
had
spat
at
her
once
they
were
alone
in
their
bedroom
she
had
waited
for
him
to
move
away
from
the
door
then
it
back
open
and
run
to
the
spare
room
and
came
over
her
in
waves
she
wished
she
could
forget
that
she
had
out
but
she
could
still
see
the
boy
face
as
she
herself
at
him
she
could
remember
the
feel
of
his
body
pressed
against
her
so
so
young
if
it
had
been
vikram
jawanda
there
might
have
been
some
dignity
in
it
she
had
to
get
coffee
she
could
not
stay
in
the
bathroom
for
ever
but
as
she
turned
to
open
the
door
she
saw
herself
in
the
mirror
and
her
courage
almost
failed
her
face
was
puffy
her
eyes
the
lines
in
her
face
more
deeply
by
pressure
and
oh
god
what
must
he
have
thought
of
me
miles
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
when
she
entered
she
did
not
look
at
him
but
crossed
straight
to
the
cupboard
where
the
coffee
was
before
she
had
touched
the
handle
he
said
ve
got
some
here
thanks
she
muttered
and
poured
herself
out
mug
avoiding
eye
contact
ve
sent
lexie
over
to
mum
and
dad
said
miles
we
need
to
talk
samantha
sat
down
at
the
kitchen
table
go
on
then
she
said
go
on
is
that
all
you
can
say
you
re
the
one
who
wants
to
talk
last
night
said
miles
at
my
father
birthday
party
came
to
look
for
you
and
found
you
sixteen
year
sixteen
year
old
yes
said
samantha
legal
one
good
thing
he
stared
at
her
appalled
you
think
this
is
funny
if
you
found
me
so
drunk
that
didn
even
realize
did
realize
said
samantha
she
refused
to
be
shirley
to
cover
everything
up
with
frilly
little
of
polite
fiction
she
wanted
to
be
honest
and
she
wanted
to
that
thick
of
through
which
she
no
longer
recognized
young
man
she
had
loved
you
did
realize
what
said
miles
he
had
so
expected
embarrassment
and
that
she
almost
laughed
did
realize
that
was
kissing
him
she
said
he
stared
at
her
and
her
courage
away
because
she
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
next
and
if
lexie
had
walked
in
samantha
had
no
answer
to
that
the
thought
of
lexie
knowing
what
had
happened
made
her
want
to
run
away
and
not
come
back
and
what
if
the
boy
told
her
they
had
been
at
school
together
she
had
forgotten
what
pagford
was
like
what
the
hell
going
on
with
you
asked
miles
unhappy
said
samantha
why
asked
miles
but
then
he
added
quickly
is
it
the
shop
is
it
that
bit
said
samantha
but
hate
living
in
pagford
hate
living
on
top
of
your
parents
and
sometimes
she
said
slowly
hate
waking
up
next
to
you
she
thought
he
might
get
angry
but
instead
he
asked
quite
calmly
are
you
saying
you
don
love
me
any
more
don
know
said
samantha
maybe
he
ll
be
the
first
of
many
yelled
samantha
getting
up
from
the
table
and
slamming
her
mug
down
in
the
sink
the
handle
came
off
in
her
hand
don
you
get
it
miles
ve
had
enough
hate
our
fucking
life
and
hate
your
fucking
parents

for
the
girls
education

to

with
the
community

meant
what
said
you
re
not
fit
to
fill
his
shoes
what
he
said
and
his
chair
fell
over
as
he
jumped
to
his
feet
while
samantha
strode
to
the
kitchen
door
you
heard
me
she
