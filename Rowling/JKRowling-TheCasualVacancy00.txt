barry
fairbrother
did
not
want
to
go
out
to
dinner
he
had
endured
for
most
of
the
weekend
and
was
struggling
to
make
for
the
local
newspaper
however
his
wife
had
been
little
stiff
and
over
lunch
and
barry
that
his
anniversary
card
had
not
the
crime
of
himself
away
in
the
study
all
morning
it
did
not
help
that
he
had
been
writing
about
krystal
whom
mary
disliked
although
she
pretended
otherwise
mary
want
to
take
you
out
to
dinner
he
had
lied
to
break
the
nineteen
years
kids
nineteen
years
and
your
mother
never
looked
mary
had
softened
and
smiled
so
barry
had
telephoned
the
golf
club
because
it
was
and
they
were
sure
of
getting
table
he
tried
to
give
his
wife
pleasure
in
little
ways
because
he
had
come
to
realize
after
nearly
two
together
how
often
he
disappointed
her
in
the
big
things
it
was
never
they
simply
had
very
different
of
what
ought
to
take
up
most
space
in
life
barry
and
mary
four
children
were
past
the
age
of
needing
they
were
watching
television
when
he
said
goodbye
to
them
for
the
last
time
and
only
declan
the
turned
to
look
at
him
and
raised
his
hand
in
farewell
barry
continued
to
behind
his
ear
as
he
out
of
the
drive
and
set
off
through
the
pretty
little
town
of
pagford
where
they
had
lived
as
long
as
they
had
been
married
they
drove
down
church
row
the
street
where
the
most
expensive
houses
stood
in
all
their
victorian
and
solidity
around
the
corner
by
the
church
where
he
had
once
watched
his
twin
girls
and
the
and
across
the
square
where
they
had
clear
view
of
the
dark
of
the
ruined
abbey
that
dominated
the
town
set
high
on
hill
with
the
sky
all
barry
could
think
of
as
he
the
wheel
the
familiar
were
the
he
was
sure
he
had
made
rushing
to
finish
the
article
he
had
just
emailed
to
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette
and
in
person
he
found
it
difficult
to
carry
his
personality
onto
paper
the
golf
club
lay
mere
four
minutes
away
from
the
square
little
beyond
the
point
where
the
town
out
in
final
of
old
cottages
barry
parked
the
people
carrier
outside
the
club
restaurant
the
and
stood
for
moment
beside
the
car
while
mary
her
lipstick
the
cool
evening
air
was
pleasant
on
his
face
as
he
watched
the
of
the
golf
course
into
the
barry
wondered
why
he
kept
up
his
he
was
bad
his
swing
was
erratic
and
his
was
high
he
had
so
many
other
calls
on
his
time
his
head
throbbed
worse
than
ever
mary
switched
off
the
mirror
light
and
closed
the
passenger
side
door
barry
pressed
the
lock
on
the
key
ring
in
his
hand
his
wife
high
heels
on
the
the
car
system
and
barry
wondered
whether
his
might
once
he
had
eaten
then
pain
such
as
he
had
never
experienced
through
his
brain
like
ball
he
barely
noticed
the
of
his
knees
as
they
onto
the
cold
his
was
with
fire
and
blood
the
was
beyond
except
that
it
he
must
for
was
still
minute
away
mary
screamed
and
kept
screaming
several
men
came
running
from
the
bar
one
of
them
back
inside
the
building
to
see
whether
either
of
the
club
retired
doctors
was
present
married
couple
of
barry
and
mary
heard
the
from
the
restaurant
their
and
hurried
outside
to
see
what
they
could
do
the
husband
called
on
his
mobile
the
ambulance
had
to
come
from
the
city
of
yarvil
and
it
took
twenty
five
minutes
to
reach
them
by
the
time
the
blue
light
slid
over
the
scene
barry
was
lying
motionless
and
on
the
ground
in
pool
of
his
own
vomit
mary
was
crouching
beside
him
the
knees
of
her
ripped
clutching
his
hand
sobbing
and
whispering
his
name
monday
yourself
said
miles
mollison
standing
in
the
kitchen
of
one
of
the
big
houses
in
church
row
he
had
waited
until
half
past
six
in
the
morning
to
make
the
call
it
had
been
bad
night
full
of
long
of
by
snatches
of
restless
sleep
at
four
in
the
morning
he
had
realized
that
his
wife
was
awake
too
and
they
had
talked
quietly
for
while
in
the
darkness
even
as
they
discussed
what
they
had
been
forced
to
witness
each
trying
to
drive
out
vague
feelings
of
and
shock
little
of
excitement
had
miles
insides
at
the
thought
of
the
news
to
his
father
he
had
intended
to
wait
until
seven
but
fear
that
somebody
else
might
beat
him
to
it
had
him
to
the
telephone
early
what
happened
boomed
howard
voice
with
slightly
edge
miles
had
put
him
on
for
samantha
benefit
mahogany
brown
in
her
pale
pink
dressing
gown
she
had
taken
advantage
of
their
early
waking
to
another
handful
of
self
sun
to
her
natural
the
kitchen
was
full
of
the
mingled
of
instant
coffee
and
fairbrother
dead
collapsed
at
the
golf
club
last
night
sam
and
were
having
dinner
at
the
fairbrother
dead
roared
howard
the
implied
that
he
had
been
expecting
some
dramatic
change
in
the
status
of
barry
fairbrother
but
that
even
he
had
not
actual
death
collapsed
in
the
car
park
repeated
miles
good
god
said
howard
he
wasn
much
past
forty
was
he
good
god
miles
and
samantha
listened
to
howard
breathing
like
he
was
always
short
of
breath
in
the
mornings
what
was
it
heart
something
in
his
brain
they
think
we
went
with
mary
to
the
hospital
and
but
howard
was
not
paying
attention
miles
and
samantha
heard
him
speaking
away
from
his
barry
fairbrother
dead
it
miles
sam
and
went
in
the
ambulance
miles
clearly
with
mary
and
the
body
samantha
noticed
how
miles
second
what
you
might
call
the
more
of
the
story
samantha
did
not
blame
him
their
reward
for
the
awful
experience
was
the
right
to
tell
people
about
it
she
did
not
think
she
would
ever
forget
it
mary
barry
eyes
still
half
open
above
the
like
mask
she
and
miles
trying
to
read
the
expression
the
the
dark
windows
the
terror
good
god
said
howard
for
the
third
time
ignoring
shirley
soft
background
questioning
his
attention
all
miles
he
just
dropped
down
dead
in
the
car
park
said
miles
moment
saw
him
it
was
pretty
obvious
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
it
was
his
first
lie
and
he
turned
his
eyes
away
from
his
wife
as
he
told
it
she
remembered
his
big
arm
around
mary
shaking
shoulders
he
ll
be
ok
he
ll
be
ok
but
after
all
thought
samantha
giving
miles
his
due
how
were
you
supposed
to
know
one
way
or
the
other
when
they
were
on
and
in
needles
it
had
seemed
as
though
they
were
trying
to
save
barry
and
none
of
them
had
known
for
certain
that
it
was
no
good
until
the
young
doctor
had
walked
towards
mary
at
the
hospital
samantha
could
still
see
with
awful
mary
naked
face
and
the
expression
of
the
haired
young
woman
in
the
white
coat
yet
little
wary
they
showed
that
sort
of
thing
on
television
all
the
time
but
when
it
actually
happened
not
at
all
miles
was
saying
gavin
was
only
playing
with
him
on
thursday
and
he
seemed
all
right
then
oh
yeah
gavin
good
god
just
goes
to
show
you
doesn
it
just
goes
to
show
hang
on
mum
wants
word
and
clatter
and
shirley
soft
voice
came
on
the
line
what
dreadful
shock
miles
she
said
are
you
all
right
samantha
took
mouthful
of
coffee
it
from
the
of
her
mouth
down
the
sides
of
her
chin
and
she
her
face
and
chest
with
her
sleeve
miles
had
adopted
the
voice
he
often
used
when
speaking
to
his
mother
deeper
than
usual
take
command
nothing
me
voice
and
no
nonsense
sometimes
especially
when
drunk
samantha
would
miles
and
shirley
conversations
not
to
worry
mummy
miles
here
your
little
darling
you
are
wonderful
so
big
and
and
clever
once
or
twice
lately
samantha
had
done
this
in
front
of
other
people
leaving
miles
cross
and
though
pretending
to
laugh
there
had
been
row
last
time
in
the
car
going
home
you
went
all
the
way
to
the
hospital
with
her
shirley
was
saying
from
the
no
thought
samantha
we
got
bored
halfway
there
and
asked
to
be
let
out
least
we
could
do
wish
we
could
have
done
more
samantha
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
sure
mary
was
very
grateful
said
shirley
samantha
crashed
the
lid
of
the
bread
bin
and
four
pieces
of
bread
into
the
miles
voice
became
more
natural
yeah
well
once
the
doctors
had
told
confirmed
that
he
was
dead
mary
wanted
colin
and
tessa
wall
sam
phoned
them
we
waited
until
they
arrived
and
then
we
left
well
it
was
very
lucky
for
mary
that
you
were
there
said
shirley
dad
wants
another
word
miles
ll
put
him
on
speak
later
speak
later
samantha
at
the
kettle
her
head
her
reflection
was
puffy
after
their
night
her
brown
eyes
bloodshot
in
her
to
witness
the
telling
of
howard
samantha
had
rubbed
into
the
why
don
you
and
sam
come
over
this
evening
howard
was
booming
no
hang
on
mum
reminded
me
we
re
playing
bridge
with
the
come
over
tomorrow
for
dinner
seven
maybe
said
miles
glancing
at
samantha
ll
have
to
see
what
sam
got
on
she
did
not
whether
or
not
she
wanted
to
go
strange
sense
of
anti
filled
the
kitchen
as
miles
hung
up
they
can
believe
it
he
said
as
if
she
hadn
heard
everything
they
ate
their
toast
and
drank
fresh
mugs
of
coffee
in
silence
some
of
samantha
lifted
as
she
she
remembered
how
she
had
woken
with
in
their
dark
bedroom
in
the
early
hours
and
had
been
relieved
and
grateful
to
feel
miles
beside
her
big
and
smelling
of
and
old
sweat
then
she
imagined
telling
customers
at
the
shop
about
how
man
had
dropped
dead
in
front
of
her
and
about
the
to
hospital
she
thought
of
ways
to
describe
various
of
the
journey
and
of
the
scene
with
the
doctor
the
youth
of
that
self
possessed
woman
had
made
the
whole
thing
seem
worse
they
ought
to
give
the
job
of
breaking
the
news
to
someone
older
then
with
further
lift
of
her
spirits
she
that
she
had
an
appointment
with
the
tomorrow
he
had
been
on
the
telephone
better
get
moving
said
miles
and
he
drained
his
coffee
mug
his
eyes
on
the
sky
beyond
the
window
he
heaved
deep
and
patted
his
wife
on
her
shoulder
as
he
passed
on
the
way
to
the
with
his
empty
plate
and
mug
christ
it
everything
in
though
doesn
it
shaking
his
close
cropped
greying
head
he
left
the
kitchen
samantha
sometimes
found
miles
and
increasingly
every
now
and
then
though
she
enjoyed
his
in
precisely
the
same
spirit
as
she
liked
on
formal
occasions
to
wear
hat
it
was
appropriate
after
all
to
be
and
little
worthy
this
morning
she
finished
her
toast
and
cleared
away
her
breakfast
things
mentally
the
story
she
planned
to
tell
her
assistant
ii
barry
fairbrother
dead
ruth
price
she
had
almost
run
up
the
garden
path
so
as
to
have
few
more
minutes
with
her
husband
before
he
left
for
work
she
didn
stop
in
the
porch
to
take
off
her
coat
but
still
muffled
and
burst
into
the
kitchen
where
simon
and
their
teenage
sons
were
eating
breakfast
her
husband
piece
of
toast
halfway
to
his
lips
then
lowered
it
with
the
two
boys
both
in
school
uniform
looked
from
one
parent
to
the
other
interested
an
they
think
said
ruth
still
little
as
she
off
her
gloves
finger
by
finger
her
scarf
and
her
coat
thin
dark
woman
with
heavy
eyes
the
stark
blue
nurse
uniform
her
he
collapsed
at
the
golf
club
sam
and
miles
mollison
brought
him
in
and
then
colin
and
tessa
wall
came
she
out
to
the
porch
to
hang
up
her
things
and
was
back
in
time
to
answer
simon
shouted
question
what
an
burst
in
the
brain
she
over
to
the
kettle
switched
it
on
then
began
to
from
the
work
surface
around
the
talking
all
the
while
he
ll
have
had
massive
his
poor
poor
wife
she
absolutely
momentarily
ruth
gazed
out
of
her
kitchen
window
over
the
of
her
lawn
at
the
abbey
across
the
stark
and
against
the
pale
pink
and
grey
sky
and
the
view
that
was
the
glory
of
hilltop
house
pagford
which
by
night
was
no
more
than
of
lights
in
dark
far
below
was
emerging
into
sunlight
ruth
saw
none
of
it
her
mind
was
still
at
the
hospital
watching
mary
from
the
room
where
barry
lay
all
to
life
removed
ruth
price
pity
flowed
most
and
for
those
whom
she
believed
to
be
like
herself
no
no
no
no
mary
had
and
that
instinctive
denial
had
inside
ruth
because
she
had
been
glimpse
of
herself
in
an
identical
situation
hardly
able
to
bear
the
thought
she
turned
to
look
at
simon
his
light
brown
hair
was
still
thick
his
frame
was
almost
as
as
it
had
been
in
his
and
the
at
the
of
his
eyes
were
merely
attractive
but
ruth
return
to
nursing
after
long
break
had
her
with
the
million
and
one
ways
the
human
body
could
she
had
had
more
when
she
was
young
now
she
realized
how
lucky
they
all
were
to
be
alive
couldn
they
do
anything
for
him
asked
simon
couldn
they
it
up
he
sounded
as
though
the
medical
profession
had
yet
again
the
business
by
refusing
to
do
the
simple
and
obvious
thing
andrew
with
pleasure
he
had
noticed
lately
that
his
father
had
habit
of
his
mother
use
of
medical
terms
with
crude
ignorant
it
up
his
mother
didn
realize
what
his
father
was
up
to
she
never
did
andrew
ate
his
and
with
hatred
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
by
the
time
they
got
him
out
to
us
said
ruth
dropping
into
the
pot
he
died
in
the
ambulance
right
before
they
arrived
bloody

simon
what

but
ruth

pulled

into
her
younger
son

simon
as
paul
dragged
the
through
the
thick
mop
of
his
hair

of
days

andrew

and
pushing
in
his
chair
relishing
the

quietly
andrew
seemed
to
have
become
liquid
he
had
made
to
himself
not
ten
days
previously

the
moment

so
soon
but
his

to
its
usual
only
when
andrew
was
about
to
leave
the
room
to
clean
his
teeth

about

longer
than

in

shirley
mollison
sat
propped
up
against

the
tea
that
her
husband
had
brought
her
the
reflection
facing
her
in
the
doors
of
the
built
in
wardrobe
had
quality
due
partly
to
the
fact
that
she
was
not
wearing
glasses
and
partly
to
the
soft
glow
cast
over
the
room
by
her
rose
patterned
curtains
in
this
hazy
light
the
pink
and

large
enough

which
still
bore

was
empty
the
soft
and
of
the
shower
was
from
where
shirley
and
her
reflection
sat
facing
each
other
the
news
that
seemed
still
to
in
the
atmosphere
like
barry
fairbrother
was
dead
out
cut
down
no
of
national
importance
no
war
no
stock
market
no
attack
could
have
in
shirley
the
the
interest
and
speculation
that
her
she
had
hated
barry
fairbrother
shirley
and
her
husband
usually
as
one
in
all
their
and
had
been
little
out
of
step
in
this
howard
had
sometimes
confessed
himself
by
the
bearded
little
man
who
opposed
him
so
across
the
long
scratched
tables
in
pagford
church
hall
but
shirley
made
no
distinction
between
the
and
the
personal
barry
had
opposed
howard
in
the
central
of
his
life
and
this
made
barry
fairbrother
her
enemy
to
her
husband
was
the
main
but
not
the
only
reason
for
shirley
dislike
her
about
people
were
in
one
direction
only
like
dog
that
has
been
to
out
she
was
perennially
to
and
had
long
detected
its
in
the
of
barry
fairbrother
and
his
on
the
parish
council
the
fairbrothers
of
the
world
assumed
that
their
university
education
made
them
better
than
people
like
her
and
howard
that
their
views
counted
for
more
well
their
arrogance
had
received
nasty
blow
today
fairbrother
sudden
death
shirley
in
the
long
held
belief
that
whatever
he
and
his
might
have
thought
he
had
been
of
lower
and
order
than
her
husband
who
in
to
all
his
other
had
managed
to
heart
attack
seven
years
previously
never
for
an
instant
had
shirley
believed
that
her
howard
would
die
even
while
he
was
in
the
operating
theatre
howard
presence
on
earth
was
to
shirley
given
like
sunlight
and
she
had
said
as
much
afterwards
when
friends
and
neighbours
had
spoken
of
and
how
lucky
that
they
had
the
unit
so
in
yarvil
and
how
worried
she
must
have
been
always
knew
he
pull
through
shirley
had
said
and
never
doubted
it
and
here
he
was
as
good
as
ever
and
there
was
fairbrother
in
the
it
only
went
to
show
in
the
of
this
early
morning
shirley
was
reminded
of
the
day
after
her
son
miles
had
been
born
she
had
sat
up
in
bed
all
those
years
ago
exactly
like
this
with
sunlight
through
the
window
cup
of
tea
that
somebody
else
had
made
her
in
her
hands
waiting
for
them
to
bring
in
her
beautiful
new
baby
boy
for
birth
and
death
there
was
the
same
consciousness
of
existence
and
of
her
own
importance
the
news
of
barry
fairbrother
sudden
lay
in
her
lap
like
fat
new
baby
to
be
over
by
all
her
and
she
would
be
the
the
source
for
she
was
first
or
nearly
so
to
receive
the
news
none
of
the
delight
and
inside
shirley
had
been
apparent
while
howard
had
been
in
the
room
they
had
merely
exchanged
the
comments
proper
to
sudden
death
before
he
had
taken
himself
off
to
the
shower
naturally
shirley
had
known
as
they
slid
stock
words
and
phrases
back
and
between
them
like
on
an
that
howard
must
be
as
of
as
she
was
but
to
express
these
feelings
out
loud
when
the
news
of
the
death
was
still
fresh
in
the
air
would
have
been
to
dancing
naked
and
and
howard
and
shirley
were
always
in
an
invisible
of
that
they
never
laid
aside
another
happy
thought
came
to
shirley
she
set
down
her
cup
and
on
the
bedside
table
slipped
out
of
bed
pulled
on
her
dressing
gown
and
her
glasses
and
down
the
hall
to
on
the
bathroom
door
howard
an
noise
answered
over
the
steady
of
the
shower
do
you
think
should
put
something
on
the
website
about
fairbrother
good
idea
he
called
through
the
door
after
moment
excellent
idea
so
she
along
to
the
study
it
had
previously
been
the
smallest
bedroom
in
the
bungalow
long
since
by
their
daughter
patricia
who
had
gone
to
london
and
was
rarely
mentioned
shirley
was
immensely
proud
of
her
skill
on
the
internet
she
had
been
to
evening
classes
in
yarvil
ten
years
previously
where
she
had
been
one
of
the
oldest
students
and
the
she
had
determined
to
be
the
administrator
of
pagford
parish
council
new
website
she
herself
in
and
brought
up
the
parish
council
the
brief
statement
flowed
so
easily
that
it
was
as
if
her
fingers
themselves
were
it
councillor
barry
fairbrother
it
is
with
great
regret
that
we
the
death
of
councillor
barry
fairbrother
our
thoughts
are
with
his
family
at
this
difficult
time
she
read
this
through
carefully
hit
return
and
watched
the
message
appear
on
the
message
board
the
queen
had
lowered
the
on
when
had
died
her
occupied
very
special
position
in
shirley
interior
life
contemplating
the
message
on
the
website
she
was
satisfied
and
happy
that
she
had
done
the
right
thing
learning
from
the
best
she
away
from
the
parish
council
message
board
and
dropped
into
her
favourite
medical
website
where
she
entered
the
words
brain
and
death
in
the
search
box
the
were
endless
shirley
through
the
her
mild
eyes
up
and
down
wondering
to
which
of
these
some
of
them
she
owed
her
present
happiness
shirley
was
hospital
she
had
quite
little
interest
in
matters
medical
since
starting
work
at
south
west
general
and
occasionally
offered
to
her
friends
but
there
was
no
on
long
words
and
this
morning
her
thoughts
away
to
the
further
of
the
news
already
she
was
mentally
and
list
of
telephone
numbers
she
wondered
whether
aubrey
and
julia
knew
and
what
they
would
say
and
whether
howard
would
let
her
tell
maureen
or
that
pleasure
for
himself
it
was
all
immensely
iv
andrew
price
closed
the
front
door
of
the
small
white
house
and
followed
his
younger
brother
down
the
steep
garden
path
with
that
led
to
the
icy
metal
gate
in
the
hedge
and
the
lane
beyond
neither
boy
spared
glance
for
the
familiar
view
spread
out
below
them
the
tiny
town
of
pagford
in
between
three
hills
one
of
which
was
with
the
remains
of
the
century
abbey
thin
river
around
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
through
town
by
toy
stone
bridge
the
scene
was
as
flat
painted
to
the
brothers
andrew
despised
the
way
that
on
the
rare
occasions
when
the
family
had
guests
his
father
seemed
to
take
credit
for
it
as
though
he
had
designed
and
built
the
whole
thing
andrew
had
lately
decided
that
he
would
prefer
an
of
broken
windows
and
graffiti
he
dreamed
of
london
and
of
life
that
mattered
the
brothers
marched
to
the
end
of
the
lane
to
on
the
corner
where
they
met
the
wider
road
andrew
reached
into
the
hedge
around
for
while
then
drew
out
half
full
packet
of
hedges
and
slightly
damp
box
of
matches
after
several
the
heads
of
the
matches
against
the
he
succeeded
in
lighting
up
two
or
three
deep
and
then
the
engine
of
the
school
bus
broke
the
stillness
andrew
carefully
knocked
out
the
head
of
his
cigarette
and
the
rest
back
in
the
packet
the
bus
was
always
two
full
by
the
time
it
reached
the
turning
for
hilltop
house
because
it
had
already
and
houses
the
brothers
sat
apart
as
usual
each
of
them
taking
double
seat
and
turning
to
out
of
the
window
as
the
bus
and
on
down
into
pagford
at
the
foot
of
their
hill
was
house
that
stood
in
shaped
garden
the
four
fairbrother
children
usually
waited
outside
the
front
gate
but
there
was
nobody
there
today
the
curtains
were
all
closed
andrew
wondered
whether
you
usually
sat
in
the
dark
when
somebody
died
few
weeks
previously
andrew
had
got
off
with
niamh
fairbrother
one
of
barry
twin
daughters
at
disco
in
the
school
drama
hall
she
had
shown
tendency
to
shadow
his
for
while
afterwards
andrew
parents
were
barely
with
the
fairbrothers
simon
and
ruth
had
hardly
any
friends
but
they
seemed
to
have
had
liking
for
barry
who
had
managed
the
of
the
only
bank
still
present
in
pagford
fairbrother
name
had
cropped
up
lot
in
connection
with
such
things
as
the
parish
council
town
hall
and
the
church
fun
run
these
were
things
in
which
andrew
had
no
interest
and
from
which
his
parents
held
themselves
the
occasional
form
or
as
the
bus
turned
left
and
down
church
row
past
the
victorian
houses
ranged
in
descending
andrew
in
little
fantasy
in
which
his
father
dropped
dead
down
by
an
invisible
andrew
himself
patting
his
sobbing
mother
on
the
back
while
he
telephoned
the
he
had
cigarette
in
his
mouth
as
he
ordered
the
coffin
the
three
jawandas
jaswant
sukhvinder
and
rajpal
got
on
the
bus
at
the
bottom
of
church
row
andrew
had
carefully
chosen
seat
with
an
empty
place
in
front
of
it
and
he
sukhvinder
to
sit
in
front
of
him
not
for
her
own
sake
andrew
best
friend
fats
referred
to
her
as
short
for
but
because
she
so
often
chose
to
sit
beside
sukhvinder
and
whether
because
his
were
particularly
powerful
this
morning
or
not
sukhvinder
did
indeed
choose
the
seat
in
front
andrew
stared
at
the
window
and
clutched
his
school
bag
more
closely
to
him
to
the
brought
on
by
the
heavy
of
the
bus
anticipation
mounted
with
every
fresh
and
as
the
edged
its
way
through
the
narrow
streets
around
the
tight
corner
into
the
village
square
and
towards
the
corner
of
her
road
andrew
had
never
experienced
this
of
interest
in
any
girl
she
was
newly
arrived
an
odd
time
to
change
schools
the
spring
term
of
the
year
her
name
was
gaia
and
that
was
fitting
because
he
had
never
heard
it
before
and
she
was
something
entirely
new
she
had
walked
onto
the
bus
one
morning
like
simple
statement
of
the
to
which
nature
could
reach
and
sat
herself
down
two
seats
in
front
of
him
while
he
sat
by
the
of
her
shoulders
and
the
back
of
her
head
she
would
be
here
any
minute
and
if
she
sat
beside
square
and
sukhvinder
as
she
so
often
did
she
would
be
close
enough
to
smell
the
on
him
he
liked
to
see
objects
to
her
body
liked
to
see
the
bus
seat
give
little
as
she
dropped
her
weight
into
it
and
that
copper
gold
mass
of
hair
curve
against
the
steel
bar
at
the
top
the
bus
driver
slowed
and
andrew
turned
his
face
away
from
the
door
pretending
to
be
lost
in
he
would
look
around
when
she
got
on
as
if
he
had
only
just
realized
that
they
had
stopped
he
would
make
eye
contact
possibly
nod
he
waited
to
hear
the
doors
open
but
the
soft
of
the
engine
was
not
interrupted
by
the
familiar
and
andrew
glanced
around
and
saw
nothing
but
short
shabby
little
hope
street
two
lines
of
small
houses
the
bus
driver
was
leaning
over
to
make
sure
she
was
not
coming
andrew
wanted
to
tell
him
to
wait
because
only
the
previous
week
she
had
burst
from
one
of
those
little
houses
and
come
running
up
the
pavement
it
had
been
to
watch
because
everyone
had
been
watching
and
the
sight
of
her
running
had
been
enough
to
occupy
his
thoughts
for
hours
but
the
driver
at
the
big
wheel
and
the
bus
set
off
again
andrew
returned
to
his
of
the
dirty
window
with
an
ache
in
his
heart
and
in
his
the
small
in
hope
street
had
once
been
houses
gavin
hughes
was
slowly
and
with
unnecessary
care
in
the
bathroom
of
number
ten
he
was
so
fair
and
his
so
that
the
job
really
only
needed
to
be
done
twice
but
the
slightly
bathroom
was
the
only
place
of
sanctuary
if
he
in
here
until
eight
he
could
say
he
needed
to
leave
for
work
immediately
he
dreaded
having
to
talk
to
kay
he
had
only
managed
to
head
off
discussion
the
previous
evening
by
the
most
and
they
had
enjoyed
since
the
very
days
of
their
relationship
kay
had
responded
immediately
and
with
enthusiasm
herself
from
position
to
position
drawing
up
her
strong
legs
for
him
like
the
she
so
closely
resembled
with
her
skin
and
very
short
dark
hair
too
late
he
had
realized
that
she
was
taking
this
act
of
as
of
those
things
he
was
determined
to
avoid
saying
she
had
kissed
him
he
had
found
her
wet
when
the
affair
began
now
he
found
them
vaguely
he
took
long
time
to
his
horror
at
what
he
had
started
constantly
threatening
to
his
even
this
worked
against
him
she
seemed
to
take
his
unusual
as
of
when
at
last
it
was
over
she
had
close
to
him
in
the
darkness
and
his
hair
for
while
miserably
he
stared
into
the
aware
that
after
all
his
vague
plans
for
the
he
had
tightened
them
after
she
had
fallen
asleep
he
had
with
one
arm
trapped
underneath
her
the
damp
sheet
to
his
thigh
on
mattress
with
old
and
wished
for
the
courage
to
be
bastard
to
slip
away
and
never
return
kay
bathroom
smelt
of
and
damp
number
of
were
stuck
to
the
side
of
the
small
bath
was
off
the
walls
it
needs
some
work
kay
had
said
gavin
had
been
careful
not
to
any
help
the
things
he
had
not
said
to
her
were
his
and
he
them
together
in
his
mind
and
checked
them
off
like
on
he
had
never
said
love
he
had
never
talked
about
marriage
he
had
never
asked
her
to
move
to
pagford
and
yet
here
she
was
and
somehow
she
made
him
feel
responsible
his
face
stared
back
at
him
from
out
of
the
mirror
there
were
purple
shadows
under
his
eyes
and
his
hair
was
and
dry
the
naked
lit
the
weak
face
with
forensic

hung
over

the
back
of
the
door
and
unlocked

pushed
past
slammed
the

behind
her
and
the
lock
home
out
on
the
tiny
landing
which
was
thick
with
an
unpleasant
smell
of
burnt
gavin
remembered
the
against
the
wall
last
night
the
of
the
cheap
pine
bed
kay
and
it
was
easy
to
forget
sometimes
that
her
daughter
was
in
the
house
he
down
the
stairs
kay
had
told
him
of
her
plans
to

polish

he
doubted
that
she
would
ever
do
it
her
flat
in
london

been
shabby
and
in
poor
in
any
case
he
was
convinced
that
she
was
expecting
to
move
in
with
him
quite
soon
but
he
would
not
it
that
was
the
final
and
there
if
forced
he
would
make
his
stand

yourself
kay

of
the

the

briefly
on
her
mouth
and
then

the
dark
narrow
hall

he
shouted
over
her
pretending
not
to
hear
gavin
hurried
across
the
road
to
his
car
the
cold
air
holding
the
fact
of
barry
death
in
his
mind
like
of
liquid
that
he
dare
not
as
he
turned
the
key
in
the
he
imagined
barry
twin
daughters
crying
face
down
in
their
beds
he
had
seen
them
lying
like
that
one
above
the
other
each
playing
on
when
he
passed
the
door
of
their
bedroom
the
very
last
time
he
had
gone
round
for
dinner
the
fairbrothers
had
been
the
most
couple
he
knew
he
would
never
eat
at
their
house
again
he
used
to
tell
barry
how
lucky
he
was
not
so
lucky
after
all
someone
was
coming
down
the
pavement
towards
him
in
panic
that
it
was
gaia
coming
to
shout
at
him
or
to
demand
lift
he
too
hard
and
hit
the
car
behind
him
kay
old
the
by
drew
level
with
his
window
and
was
revealed
to
be
an
old
woman
in
carpet
sweating
gavin
swung
his
wheel
around
and
squeezed
out
of
the
space
as
he
he
glanced
in
the
rear
view
mirror
and
saw
gaia
letting
herself
back
into
kay
house
he
was
having
difficulty
getting
enough
air
into
his
lungs
there
was
tight
knot
in
his
chest
only
now
did
he
realize
that
barry
fairbrother
had
been
his
best
friend
vi
the
school
bus
had
reached
the
fields
the
estate
that
lay
on
the
of
the
city
of
yarvil
dirty
grey
houses
some
of
them
painted
with
initials
and
the
occasional
boarded
window
and
grass
none
of
it
was
any
more
worthy
of
andrew
attention
than
the
ruined
abbey
of
pagford
glittering
with
andrew
had
once
been
and
intimidated
by
the
fields
but
had
long
since
it
all
commonplace
the
with
children
and
teenagers
walking
towards
school
many
of
them
in
shirts
despite
the
cold
andrew
spotted
krystal
weedon
and
dirty
joke
she
was
along
laughing
in
the
middle
of
group
of
teenagers
swung
from
each
ear
and
the
of
her
was
clearly
visible
above
her
low
tracksuit
bottoms
andrew
had
known
her
since
primary
school
and
she
in
many
of
the
most
highly
coloured
memories
of
his
youth
they
had
at
her
name
but
instead
of
crying
as
most
of
the
little
girls
would
have
done
five
year
old
krystal
had
caught
on
and
shrieked
on
krystal
on
and
she
had
pulled
down
her
pants
in
the
middle
of
class
and
pretended
to
do
it
he
retained
vivid
memory
of
her
bare
pink
it
was
as
though
father
christmas
had
up
in
their
and
he
remembered
miss
bright
red
in
the
face
krystal
from
the
room
by
the
age
of
twelve
to
the
comprehensive
krystal
had
become
the
most
well
girl
in
their
year
and
had
lingered
at
the
back
of
the
class
where
they
were
supposed
to
take
their
maths
when
they
had
finished
and
them
for
the
next
in
the
series
how
it
had
been
andrew
among
the
last
to
finish
his
maths
as
ever
had
no
idea
but
he
had
reached
the
plastic
boxes
of
neatly
lined
up
on
top
of
the
cupboards
at
the
back
to
find
and
mark
taking
it
in
to
cup
and
krystal
breasts
most
of
the
other
boys
were
looking
on
their
faces
hidden
from
the
teacher
by
their
while
the
girls
many
of
them
flushed
scarlet
were
pretending
not
to
have
seen
andrew
had
realized
that
half
the
boys
had
already
had
their
turn
and
that
he
was
expected
to
take
his
he
had
both
wanted
and
not
wanted
to
it
was
not
her
breasts
he
feared
but
the
challenging
look
on
her
face
he
had
been
frightened
of
doing
it
wrong
when
the
oblivious
and
mr
had
looked
up
at
last
and
said
you
ve
been
up
there
for
ever
krystal
get
and
sit
down
andrew
had
been
almost
entirely
relieved
though
they
had
long
since
been
separated
into
different
they
were
still
in
the
same
class
so
andrew
knew
that
krystal
was
sometimes
present
often
not
and
that
she
was
in
almost
constant
trouble
she
knew
no
fear
like
the
boys
who
came
to
school
with
they
had
themselves
with
split
lips
and
cigarettes
and
stories
of
with
the
police
of
drug
taking
and
easy
sex
winterdown
comprehensive
lay
just
inside
yarvil
large
ugly
building
whose
of
windows
with
painted
when
the
bus
doors
open
andrew
joined
the
black
and
that
were
across
the
car
park
towards
the
school
two
front
as
he
was
about
to
join
the
itself
through
the
double
doors
he
noticed
pulling
up
and
detached
himself
to
wait
for
his
best
friend
fats
stuart
wall
was
the
most
boy
in
school
his
walk
his
his
thin
face
ears
and
permanently
expression
were
distinctive
enough
but
it
was
his
humour
his
and
that
set
him
apart
somehow
he
managed
to
himself
from
everything
that
might
have
defined
less
character
off
the
embarrassment
of
being
the
son
of
and
deputy
head
of
having
guidance
teacher
as
mother
he
was
pre
and
himself
fats
school
and
landmark
and
even
the
fielders
laughed
at
his
jokes
and
rarely
bothered
so
coolly
and
did
he
return
to
laugh
at
his
unfortunate
fats
self
possession
remained
total
this
morning
when
in
full
view
of
the
parent
free
past
he
had
to
struggle
out
of
the
alongside
not
only
his
mother
but
his
father
too
who
usually
travelled
to
school
andrew
thought
again
of
krystal
weedon
and
her
exposed
as
fats
towards
him
all
right
arf
said
fats
fats
they
moved
together
into
the
crowd
their
school
bags
over
their
shoulders
the
shorter
kids
in
the
face
small
space
in
their
cubby
been
crying
said
fats
as
they
walked
up
the
stairs
say
what
barry
fairbrother
dropped
dead
last
night
oh
yeah
heard
said
andrew
fats
gave
andrew
the
sly
look
he
used
when
others
over
reached
themselves
pretended
to
know
more
than
they
did
pretended
to
be
more
than
they
were
my
mum
was
at
the
hospital
when
they
brought
him
in
said
andrew
she
works
there
remember
oh
yeah
said
fats
and
the
was
gone
well
you
know
how
him
and
cubby
were
and
cubby
going
to
it
not
good
arf
they
parted
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
for
their
rooms
most
of
andrew
class
was
already
in
their
room
sitting
on
desks
swinging
their
legs
leaning
up
against
the
cupboards
at
the
sides
bags
lay
under
chairs
talk
was
always
louder
and
than
usual
on
monday
mornings
because
assembly
meant
an
open
air
walk
to
the
hall
their
teacher
sat
at
her
desk
people
present
as
they
came
in
she
never
bothered
to
call
the
formally
it
was
one
of
the
many
small
ways
in
which
she
attempted
to
herself
with
them
and
the
class
despised
her
for
it
krystal
arrived
as
the
bell
rang
for
assembly
she
shouted
here
miss
from
the
doorway
and
swung
herself
back
out
again
everyone
else
followed
her
still
talking
andrew
and
fats
were
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
were
borne
by
the
general
flow
out
of
the
back
doors
and
across
the
wide
grey
yard
the
hall
smelt
of
sweat
and
trainers
the
din
of
twelve
hundred
talking
teenagers
echoed
off
its
walls
hard
grey
and
much
stained
carpet
covered
the
floor
with
different
coloured
lines
out
and
and
football
the
stuff
gave
vicious
if
you
fell
on
it
bare
but
was
easier
on
the
than
bare
wood
for
those
who
had
to
sit
on
it
for
the
of
whole
school
assembly
andrew
and
fats
had
the
dignity
of
plastic
backed
chairs
ranged
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
for
the
fifth
and
sixth
years
an
old
wooden
stood
at
the
front
facing
the
and
beside
it
sat
the
headmistress
mrs
fats
father
colin
cubby
wall
walked
over
to
take
his
place
beside
her
very
tall
he
had
high
forehead
and
an
immensely
walk
his
arms
held
rigid
by
his
side
up
and
down
more
than
was
necessary
for
forward
everyone
called
him
cubby
because
of
his
obsession
with
keeping
the
on
the
wall
outside
his
school
office
in
good
order
the
went
into
some
of
them
after
they
had
been
marked
while
others
were
to
specific
be
sure
and
put
it
in
the
right
don
leave
it
hanging
out
like
that
it
ll
fall
out
of
the
don
walk
over
it
girl
pick
it
up
give
it
here
it
meant
to
be
in
all
the
other
teachers
called
them
it
was
assumed
that
they
did
this
to
set
themselves
apart
from
cubby
move
along
move
along
said
mr
the
teacher
to
andrew
and
fats
who
had
left
an
empty
seat
between
themselves
and
cubby
took
his
place
behind
the
the
did
not
settle
as
quickly
as
they
would
have
done
for
the
headmistress
at
the
precise
moment
that
the
last
voice
died
away
one
of
the
double
doors
in
the
middle
of
the
right
hand
wall
opened
and
gaia
walked
in
she
glanced
around
the
hall
andrew
permitted
himself
to
watch
because
half
the
hall
was
watching
her
she
was
late
and
unfamiliar
and
beautiful
and
it
was
only
cubby
talking
and
walked
quickly
but
not
so
because
she
had
fats
gift
of
self
possession
around
the
back
of
the
students
andrew
head
could
not
to
keep
watching
her
but
it
struck
him
with
force
that
made
his
ears
ring
that
in
moving
along
with
fats
he
had
left
an
empty
seat
beside
him
he
heard
light
rapid
footsteps
coming
closer
and
then
she
was
there
she
had
sat
down
right
next
to
him
she
his
chair
her
body
moving
his
his
nostrils
caught
whisper
of
the
whole
of
the
left
side
of
his
body
was
burning
with
awareness
of
her
and
he
was
grateful
that
the
cheek
nearest
her
was
much
less
acne
than
the
right
he
had
never
been
this
close
to
her
and
wondered
whether
he
dared
look
at
her
make
some
sign
of
recognition
but
immediately
decided
he
had
been
too
long
and
that
it
was
too
late
to
do
so
naturally
scratching
his
left
to
screen
his
face
he
his
to
glance
down
at
her
hands
clasped
on
her
lap
the
were
short
clean
and
there
was
plain
silver
ring
on
one
little
finger
fats
moved
his
elbow
to
put
pressure
on
andrew
side
cubby
said
and
andrew
realized
that
he
had
already
heard
cubby
say
the
word
twice
and
that
the
in
the
hall
had
into
silence
as
all
ceased
and
the
air
became
stiff
with
curiosity
and
unease
said
cubby
again
and
his
voice
out
of
control
have
very
have
very
sad
to
make
mr
barry
fairbrother
who
has
our
extremely
success
successful
girls
rowing
team
for
the
past
two
years
has
he
and
passed
hand
in
front
of
his
eyes
died
cubby
wall
was
crying
in
front
of
everybody
his
head
onto
his
chest
and
rolled
across
the
watching
crowd
and
many
faces
turned
towards
fats
who
sat
looking
little
but
otherwise
died
sobbed
cubby
and
the
headmistress
stood
up
looking
cross
died
last
night
loud
rose
from
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
lines
of
chairs
at
the
back
of
the
hall
who
laughed
roared
cubby
and
the
air
with
delicious
tension
how
dare
you
what
girl
laughed
who
was
it
mr
was
already
on
his
feet
furiously
at
somebody
in
the
middle
of
the
row
just
behind
andrew
and
fats
andrew
chair
was
again
because
gaia
had
twisted
in
her
seat
to
watch
like
everyone
else
andrew
entire
body
seemed
to
have
become
he
could
feel
the
way
gaia
body
was
towards
his
if
he
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
they
would
be
breast
to
chest
who
laughed
repeated
cubby
raising
himself
on
as
if
he
might
be
able
to
make
out
the
from
where
he
was
standing
was
and
at
the
person
he
had
out
for
blame
who
is
it
mr
shouted
cubby
appeared
unwilling
to
say
he
was
still
having
difficulty
in
the
guilty
party
to
leave
her
seat
but
as
cubby
began
to
show
signs
of
leaving
the
to
investigate
personally
krystal
weedon
shot
to
her
feet
scarlet
in
the
face
and
started
pushing
her
way
along
the
row
you
will
see
me
in
my
office
immediately
after
assembly
shouted
cubby
absolutely
total
lack
of
respect
get
out
of
my
sight
but
krystal
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
row
stuck
up
her
middle
finger
at
cubby
and
screamed
di
do
you
there
was
an
of
excited
and
laughter
the
teachers
made
attempts
to
the
noise
and
one
or
two
left
their
chairs
to
try
and
their
own
classes
back
into
order
the
double
doors
swung
shut
behind
krystal
and
mr
settle
down
shouted
the
headmistress
and
quiet
with
and
spread
over
the
hall
again
fats
was
staring
straight
ahead
and
there
was
for
once
forced
air
to
his
indifference
and
darker
to
his
skin
andrew
felt
gaia
fall
back
into
her
chair
he
up
his
courage
glanced
left
and
she
smiled
right
back
vii
though
pagford
delicatessen
would
not
open
until
nine
thirty
howard
mollison
had
arrived
early
he
was
an
man
of
sixty
four
great
apron
of
stomach
fell
so
far
down
in
front
of
his
that
most
people
thought
instantly
of
his
when
they
first
clapped
eyes
on
him
wondering
when
he
had
last
seen
it
how
he
washed
it
how
he
managed
to
any
of
the
for
which
is
designed
partly
because
his
set
off
these
of
thought
and
partly
because
of
his
fine
line
in
howard
managed
to
and
in
almost
equal
measure
so
that
customers
almost
always
bought
more
than
they
meant
to
on
first
visit
to
the
shop
he
kept
up
the
while
he
worked
one
short
hand
sliding
the
meat
smoothly
backwards
and
forwards
fine
of
ham
onto
the
held
below
ever
ready
in
his
round
blue
eyes
his
with
easy
laughter
howard
had
devised
to
wear
to
work
white
shirt
sleeves
stiff
dark
green
apron
trousers
and
deerstalker
into
which
he
had
number
of
flies
if
the
deerstalker
had
ever
been
joke
it
had
long
since
ceased
to
be
every
morning
he
it
with
unsmiling
on
his
grey
by
small
mirror
in
the
staff
lavatory
it
was
howard
constant
pleasure
to
open
up
in
the
mornings
he
loved
moving
around
the
shop
while
the
only
sound
was
that
of
the
softly
bringing
it
all
back
to
life
on
the
lights
pulling
up
the
to
the
of
the
chilled
counter
the
pale
grey
green
the
black
the
dried
curled
like
in
their
oil
this
morning
however
his
was
with
impatience
his
business
partner
maureen
was
already
late
and
like
miles
earlier
howard
was
afraid
that
somebody
might
beat
him
to
the
telling
of
the
news
because
she
did
not
have
mobile
phone
he
paused
beside
the
newly
in
the
wall
between
the
delicatessen
and
the
old
shop
soon
to
become
pagford
café
and
checked
the
strength
clear
plastic
that
dust
from
settling
in
the
delicatessen
they
were
planning
to
have
the
café
open
before
in
time
to
pull
in
the
to
the
west
country
for
whom
howard
filled
the
windows
with
local
and
the
bell
tinkled
behind
him
and
he
turned
his
and
heart
fast
from
excitement
maureen
was
slight
round
woman
of
sixty
two
and
the
widow
of
howard
original
partner
heard
the
news
she
at
him
barry
fairbrother
dead
her
mouth
fell
open
no
how
howard
the
side
of
his
head
something
went
up
here
miles
was
there
saw
it
all
happen
golf
club
car
park
no
she
said
again
stone
dead
said
howard
as
though
there
were
of
and
the
kind
that
barry
fairbrother
had
was
particularly
maureen
brightly
mouth
hung
as
she
crossed
herself
her
always
added
touch
to
such
moments
miles
was
there
she
croaked
he
heard
the
yearning
for
every
detail
in
her
deep
voice
you
want
to
put
on
the
kettle
mo
he
could
at
least
her
for
few
minutes
she
boiling
tea
over
her
hand
in
her
to
return
to
him
they
sat
together
behind
the
counter
on
the
high
wooden
howard
had
placed
there
for
slack
and
maureen
her
burnt
hand
on
of
ice
scraped
from
around
the
together
they
rattled
through
the
conventional
of
the
tragedy
the
widow
she
ll
be
lost
she
lived
for
barry
the
children
four
teenagers
what
burden
without
father
the
relative
youth
of
the
dead
man
he
wasn
much
older
than
miles
was
he
and
then
at
last
they
reached
the
real
point
of
departure
beside
which
all
else
was
what
ll
happen
maureen
asked
howard
ah
said
howard
well
now
that
the
question
isn
it
we
ve
got
ourselves
casual
vacancy
mo
and
it
could
make
all
the
difference
we
ve
got
asked
maureen
frightened
that
she
might
have
missed
something
crucial
casual
vacancy
repeated
howard
what
you
call
it
when
council
seat
vacant
through
death
proper
term
he
said
howard
was
the
chair
of
the
parish
council
and
first
of
pagford
the
position
came
with
and
chain
of
office
now
in
the
tiny
safe
that
he
and
shirley
had
had
at
the
bottom
of
their
fitted
if
only
pagford
district
had
been
granted
status
he
would
have
been
able
to
call
himself
but
even
so
to
all
and
that
was
what
he
was
shirley
had
made
this
perfectly
clear
on
the
of
the
council
website
where
beneath
beaming
and
photograph
of
howard
in
his
first
chain
it
was
stated
that
he
welcomed
to
attend
local
and
business
functions
just
few
weeks
previously
he
had
handed
out
the
cycling
at
the
local
primary
school
howard
his
tea
and
said
with
smile
to
take
off
the
fairbrother
was
mind
mo
he
could
be
real
oh
know
she
said
know
have
had
to
have
it
out
with
him
if
he
lived
ask
shirley
he
could
be
an
oh
know
well
we
ll
see
we
ll
see
this
should
be
the
end
of
it
mind
certainly
didn
want
to
win
like
this
he
added
with
deep
but
speaking
for
the
sake
of
pagford
for
the
community
it
not
all
bad
howard
checked
his
watch
that
nearly
half
past
mo
they
were
never
late
opening
up
never
early
closing
the
business
was
run
with
the
ritual
and
of
maureen
over
to
the
door
and
pull
up
the
the
square
was
revealed
in
as
