back
to
the
all
his
life
it
was
and
worked
by
second
cousins
who
seemed
and
the
caused
regular
arguments
among
her
mother
family
gone
off
on
one
again
jaswant
as
parminder
muffled
voice
the
door
parminder
had
taught
her
first
born
some
and
had
picked
up
lot
more
from
their
cousins
sukhvinder
had
been
too
to
her
to
learn
two
and
the
attempt
had
been
still
wants
to
sell
off
that
bit
for
the
road
sukhvinder
heard
parminder
kicking
off
her
shoes
she
wished
that
her
mother
had
not
been
bothered
about
the
tonight
of
all
nights
it
never
put
her
into
good
mood
and
when
parminder
pushed
open
the
kitchen
door
and
she
saw
her
mother
tight
mask
like
face
her
courage
failed
her
completely
parminder
acknowledged
jaswant
and
rajpal
with
slight
wave
of
her
hand
but
she
pointed
at
sukhvinder
and
then
towards
kitchen
chair
that
she
was
to
sit
down
and
wait
for
the
call
to
end
jaswant
and
rajpal
drifted
back
upstairs
sukhvinder
waited
beneath
the
wall
of
photographs
in
which
her
relative
was
for
the
world
to
see
to
her
chair
by
her
mother
silent
command
on
and
on
went
the
call
until
at
long
last
parminder
said
goodbye
and
cut
the
connection
when
she
turned
to
look
at
her
daughter
sukhvinder
knew
instantly
before
word
was
spoken
that
she
had
been
wrong
to
hope
so
said
parminder
had
call
from
tessa
while
was
at
work
expect
you
know
what
it
was
about
sukhvinder
nodded
her
mouth
seemed
to
be
full
of
cotton
wool
parminder
rage
crashed
over
her
like
wave
dragging
sukhvinder
with
it
so
that
she
was
unable
to
find
her
feet
or
right
herself
why
why
is
this
the
london
girl
again
are
you
trying
to
impress
her
and
never
behave
like
this
never
why
do
you
what
wrong
with
you
are
you
proud
of
being
and
do
you
think
it
cool
to
act
like
how
do
you
think
felt
when
tessa
told
me
called
at
work
ve
never
been
so
ashamed
by
you
do
you
hear
me
do
we
not
give
you
enough
do
we
not
help
you
enough
what
is
wrong
with
you
sukhvinder
in
desperation
sukhvinder
tried
to
break
through
her
mother
and
mentioned
the
name
krystal
weedon
krystal
weedon
shouted
parminder
that
stupid
girl
why
are
you
paying
attention
to
anything
she
says
did
you
tell
her
tried
to
keep
her
damn
great
grandmother
alive
did
you
tell
her
that
no
if
you
re
going
to
care
about
what
the
likes
of
krystal
weedon
says
there
no
hope
for
you
perhaps
that
your
natural
level
is
it
sukhvinder
you
want
to
play
and
work
in
caf√©
and
waste
all
your
for
education
because
that
easier
is
that
what
being
in
team
with
krystal
weedon
taught
you
to
sink
to
her
level
sukhvinder
thought
of
krystal
and
her
to
go
on
the
opposite
waiting
for
break
in
the
cars
what
would
it
take
to
make
her
mother
understand
an
hour
ago
she
had
had
the
fantasy
that
she
might
confide
in
her
mother
at
last
about
fats
wall
get
out
of
my
sight
go
ll
speak
to
your
father
when
he
comes
in
go
sukhvinder
walked
upstairs
jaswant
called
from
her
bedroom
what
was
all
that
shouting
about
sukhvinder
did
not
answer
she
proceeded
to
her
own
room
where
she
closed
the
door
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
what
wrong
with
you
sukhvinder
you
disgust
me
are
you
proud
of
being
and
what
had
she
expected
warm
arms
and
comfort
when
had
she
ever
been
and
held
by
parminder
there
was
more
comfort
to
be
had
from
the
blade
hidden
in
her
but
the
desire
to
need
to
cut
and
could
not
be
satisfied
by
daylight
with
the
family
awake
and
her
father
on
his
way
the
dark
of
desperation
and
pain
that
lived
in
sukhvinder
and
for
release
was
in
flames
as
if
it
had
been
all
along
let
her
see
how
it
feels
she
got
up
crossed
her
bedroom
in
few
and
dropping
into
the
chair
by
her
desk
pounded
at
the
of
her
computer
sukhvinder
had
been
just
as
interested
as
andrew
price
when
that
stupid
supply
teacher
had
tried
to
impress
them
with
his
cool
in
computing
unlike
andrew
and
couple
of
the
other
boys
sukhvinder
had
not
the
teacher
with
questions
about
the
she
had
merely
gone
home
quietly
and
looked
it
all
up
online
nearly
every
modern
website
was
against
but
when
sukhvinder
had
heard
her
mother
discussing
the
anonymous
attack
on
the
pagford
parish
council
website
it
had
occurred
to
sukhvinder
that
the
security
on
that
old
site
was
probably
sukhvinder
always
found
it
much
easier
to
type
than
to
write
and
computer
code
easier
to
read
than
long
of
words
it
did
not
take
very
long
for
her
to
site
that
gave
instructions
for
the
form
of
then
she
brought
up
the
parish
council
website
it
took
her
five
minutes
to
the
site
and
then
only
because
she
had
the
code
wrong
the
first
time
to
her
she
discovered
that
whoever
was
the
site
had
not
removed
the
details
of
from
the
but
merely
the
post
it
would
be
child
play
therefore
to
post
in
the
same
name
it
took
sukhvinder
much
longer
to
the
message
than
it
had
to
into
the
site
she
had
carried
the
secret
with
her
for
months
ever
since
new
year
when
she
had
noticed
with
wonder
her
mother
face
at
ten
to
midnight
from
the
corner
of
the
party
where
she
was
hiding
she
typed
slowly
helped
with
her
she
was
not
afraid
that
parminder
would
check
her
computer
history
her
mother
knew
so
little
about
her
and
about
what
went
on
in
this
bedroom
that
she
would
never
suspect
her
stupid
daughter
sukhvinder
pressed
the
mouse
like
krystal
did
not
take
robbie
to
nursery
on
tuesday
morning
but
dressed
him
for
nana
cath
funeral
instead
as
she
pulled
up
his
least
ripped
trousers
which
were
good
two
inches
too
short
in
the
leg
she
tried
to
explain
to
him
who
nana
cath
had
been
but
she
might
as
well
have
saved
her
breath
robbie
had
no
memory
of
nana
cath
he
had
no
idea
what
nana
meant
no
of
any
relative
other
than
mother
and
sister
in
spite
of
her
and
stories
krystal
knew
that
terri
had
no
idea
who
his
father
was
krystal
heard
her
mother
footsteps
on
the
stairs
leave
it
she
snapped
at
robbie
who
had
reached
for
an
empty
beer
can
lying
beneath
terri
usual
armchair
ere
she
pulled
robbie
by
the
hand
into
the
hall
terri
was
still
wearing
the
bottoms
and
dirty
shirt
in
which
she
had
spent
the
night
and
her
feet
were
bare
why
changed
demanded
krystal

said
terri
pushing
past
her
son
and
daughter
into
the
kitchen

terri
she
was
lighting
cigarette
off
the
ring

holding
robbie
hand
as
he
tugged
and
swung
they
re
all
said
krystal
cheryl
an
an
all
so
said
terri
aggressively
krystal
had
been
afraid
that
her
mother
would
pull
out
at
the
last
minute
the
funeral
would
bring
her
face
to
face
with
the
sister
who
pretended
that
terri
did
not
exist
not
to
mention
all
the
other
relatives
who
had
them
anne
might
be
there
krystal
had
been
holding
on
to
that
hope
like
torch
in
the
darkness
through
the
nights
she
had
sobbed
for
nana
cath
and
mr
fairbrother

krystal

krystal

krystal
her
face
hot
and
her

clutching

repeated
terri
with
pathetic
dignity

to
the
funeral
said
krystal
loudly
you

said
krystal
her
voice
an
higher
ain
said
terri
but
she
turned
away
looking
out
of
the
dirty
back
window
over
the
patch
of
strewn
grass
they
called
the
back
garden
robbie
tugged
his
hand
out
of
krystal
and
disappeared
into
the
sitting
room
with
her
fists
deep
in
her
pockets
shoulders
krystal
tried
to
decide
what
to
do
she
wanted
to
cry
at
the
thought
of
not
going
to
the
funeral
but
her
distress
was
edged
with
relief
that
she
would
not
have
to
face
the
of
eyes
she
had
sometimes
met
at
nana
cath
she
was
angry
with
terri
and
yet
felt
strangely
on
her
side
you
don
even
know
who
the
father
is
do
yeh
yer
whore
she
wanted
to
meet
anne
but
was
scared
all
righ
then
ll
stay
an
all
you
don
ave
ter
go
if
yeh
wan
don
fuckin
care
but
krystal
certain
that
obbo
would
appear
stayed
obbo
had
been
away
for
more
than
week
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
krystal
wished
that
he
had
died
that
he
would
never
come
back
for
something
to
do
she
began
to
tidy
the
house
while
smoking
one
of
the
roll
ups
fats
wall
had
given
her
she
didn
like
them
but
she
liked
that
he
had
given
them
to
her
she
had
been
keeping
them
in
nikki
plastic
jewellery
box
along
with
tessa
watch
she
had
thought
that
she
might
not
see
fats
any
more
after
their
shag
in
the
because
he
had
been
almost
silent
afterwards
and
left
her
with
barely
goodbye
but
they
had
since
met
up
on
the
she
could
tell
that
he
had
enjoyed
this
time
more
than
the
last
they
had
not
been
and
he
had
lasted
longer
he
lay
beside
her
in
the
grass
beneath
the
bushes
smoking
and
when
she
had
told
him
about
nana
cath
dying
he
had
told
her
that
sukhvinder
jawanda
mother
had
given
nana
cath
the
wrong
drugs
or
something
he
was
not
clear
exactly
what
had
happened
krystal
had
been
horrified
so
nana
cath
need
not
have
died
she
might
still
have
been
in
the
neat
little
house
on
hope
street
there
in
case
krystal
needed
her
offering
with
comfortable
clean
bed
the
tiny
kitchen
full
of
food
and
china
and
the
little
tv
in
the
corner
of
the
sitting
room
don
wanna
watch
no
filth
krystal
turn
that
off
krystal
had
liked
sukhvinder
but
sukhvinder
mother
had
killed
nana
cath
you
did
not
between
members
of
an
enemy
it
had
been
krystal
intention
to
sukhvinder
but
then
tessa
wall
had
krystal
could
not
remember
the
details
of
what
tessa
had
told
her
but
it
seemed
that
fats
had
got
the
story
wrong
or
at
least
not
exactly
right
she
had
given
tessa
grudging
promise
not
to
go
after
sukhvinder
but
such
could
only
ever
be
stop
in
krystal
ever
changing
world
put
it
down
krystal
shouted
at
robbie
because
he
was
trying
to
the
lid
off
the
biscuit
tin
where
terri
kept
her
works
krystal
snatched
the
tin
from
him
and
held
it
in
her
hands
like
living
something
that
would
fight
to
stay
alive
whose
would
have
consequences
there
was
scratched
picture
on
the
lid
with

high
on
the
roof

belly
as
he
his
own
flies
she
tried
to
scream
and
he
her
across

thick
in
her
nostrils
as

in
her
ear

was
inside

and
it

she
could
hear

tiny
she
was
ashamed
of
the
noise
she
made
so
frightened
and
so
small
he
came
and
off
her
at
once
she
pulled
up
her
tracksuit
bottoms
and
jumped
up
to
face

tears
pouring
down
her
face
as
he
at

he
up

hall
and

gone
she
was
shaking
as
she
had
never
done
in
her
life
she
thought
she
might
be
sick
she
could
smell
him
all
over
her
the
back
of
her
head
throbbed
there
was
pain
inside
her
and
into
her
pants
she
ran
out
of
the
room
into
the
living
room
and
stood
with
her
arms
wrapped
around
herself
then
she
knew
moment
of
terror
that
he
would
come
back
and
hurried
to
the
front
door
to
lock
it
back
in
the
sitting
room
she
found
long
in
the
and
lit
it
smoking
shaking
and
sobbing
she
sank
into
terri
usual
chair
then
jumped
up
because
she
heard
footsteps
on
the
stairs
terri
had
reappeared
looking
confused
and
wary
wha
matter
with
you
krystal
on
the
words
he
jus
he
jus
fucked
me
wha
said
terri
obbo
jus

was
the
instinctive
denial
with
which
terri
met
all
of
life
he
wouldn
no
never
no
didn
krystal
at
her
and
pushed
her
as
she
was
terri
crumpled
backwards
into
the
hall
and
swearing
krystal
ran
to
the
door
she
had
just
locked
fumbled
to
it
and
it
open
still
sobbing
she
was
twenty
yards
along
the
dark
street
before
she
realized
that
obbo
might
be
waiting
out
here
watching
she
cut
across
neighbour
garden
at
run
and
took
route
through
back
ways
in
the
direction
of
nikki
house
and
all
the
time
the
spread
in
her
pants
and
she
thought
she
might
throw
up
krystal
knew
that
it
was
what
he
had
done
it
had
happened
to
leanne
older
sister
in
the
car
park
of
in
some
people
would
have
gone
to
the
police
she
knew
that
but
you
did
not
invite
the
police
into
your
life
when
your
mother
was
terri
weedon
ll
tell
fairbrother
her
sobs
came
and
she
could
have
told
mr
fairbrother
he
had
known
what
real
life
was
like
one
of
his
brothers
had
done
time
he
had
told
krystal
stories
of
his
youth
it
had
not
been
like
her
youth
nobody
was
as
low
as
her
she
knew
that
but
like
nikki
like
leanne
money
had
run
out
his
mother
had
bought
her
council
house
and
then
been
unable
to
keep
up
the
they
had
lived
for
while
in
caravan
by
an
uncle
mr
fairbrother
took
care
of
things
he
things
out
he
had
come
to
their
house
and
talked
to
terri
about
krystal
and
rowing
because
there
had
been
an
argument
and
terri
was
refusing
to
sign
forms
for
krystal
to
go
away
with
the
team
he
had
not
been
or
he
had
not
shown
it
which
came
to
the
same
thing
terri
who
liked
and
trusted
nobody
had
said
seems
all
righ
and
she
had
signed
mr
fairbrother
had
once
said
to
her
it
ll
be
for
you
than
these
others
krys
it
was
for
me
but
you
can
do
better
you
don
have
to
go
the
same
way
he
had
meant
working
hard
at
school
and
stuff
but
it
was
too
late
for
that
and
anyway
it
was
all
how
would
reading
help
her
now
me
boy
he
ain
your
fuckin
boy
you
know
leanne
sister
had
had
to
get
the
morning
after
krystal
would
ask
leanne
about
the
and
go
and
get
it
she
could
not
have
obbo
baby
the
thought
of
it
made
her
gotta
get
out
of
here
she
thought
of
kay
and
then
her
as
bad
as
the
police
to
tell
social
worker
that
obbo
walked
in
and
out
of
their
house
people
she
would
take
robbie
for
sure
if
she
knew
that
clear
voice
in
krystal
head
was
speaking
to
mr
fairbrother
who
was
the
only
adult
who
had
ever
talked
to
her
the
way
she
needed
unlike
mrs
wall
so
well
and
so
and
nana
cath
refusing
to
hear
the
whole
truth
gotta
get
robbie
out
of
here
how
can
get
away
gotta
get
away
her
one
sure
the
little
house
in
hope
street
was
already
being
up
by
relatives
she
around
corner
underneath
street
lamp
looking
over
her
shoulder
in
case
he
was
watching
her
following
and
then
the
answer
came
to
her
as
though
mr
fairbrother
had
shown
her
the
way
if
she
got
knocked
up
by
fats
wall
she
would
be
able
to
get
her
own
place
from
the
council
she
would
be
able
to
take
robbie
to
live
with
her
and
the
baby
if
terri
used
again
and
obbo
would
never
enter
her
house
not
ever
there
would
be
bolts
and
and
locks
on
the
door
and
her
house
would
be
clean
always
clean
like
nana
cath
house
half
running
along
the
dark
street
krystal
sobs
slowed
and
subsided
the
walls
would
probably
give
her
money
they
were
like
that
she
could
imagine
tessa
plain
concerned
face
bending
over
krystal
would
have
their
she
would
lose
fats
in
getting
pregnant
they
always
went
once
you
were
expecting
she
had
watched
it
happen
nearly
every
time
in
the
fields
but
perhaps
he
would
be
interested
he
was
so
strange
it
did
not
much
matter
to
her
either
way
her
interest
in
him
except
as
the
in
her
plan
had
to
almost
nothing
what
she
wanted
was
the
baby
the
baby
was
more
than
means
to
an
end
she
liked
she
had
always
loved
robbie
she
would
keep
the
two
of
them
safe
together
she
would
be
like
better
younger
nana
cath
to
her
family
anne
might
come
and
visit
once
she
was
away
from
terri
their
children
would
be
cousins
very
vivid
image
of
herself
and
anne
came
to
krystal
they
were
standing
at
the
school
gates
of
st
thomas
in
pagford
off
two
little
girls
in
pale
blue
dresses
and
the
lights
were
on
in

house
as
they
always
were

seventh
edition
samantha
mollison
had
now
bought
herself
all
three
of
the
released
by
libby
favourite
boy
band
she
kept
them
hidden
in
her
and
drawer
beside
her
she
had
her
story
ready
if
miles
spotted
them
they
were
gift
for
libby
sometimes
at
work
where
business
was
than
ever
she
searched
the
internet
for
pictures
of
it
was
during
one
of
these
sessions
in
suit
but
with
no
shirt
in
jeans
and
white
that
she
discovered
that
the
band
was
playing
at
in
fortnight
time
she
had
friend
from
university
who
lived
in
west
she
could
stay
over
sell
it
to
libby
as
treat
chance
to
spend
time
together
with
more
genuine
excitement
than
she
had
felt
in
long
time
samantha
managed
to
buy
two
very
expensive
for
the
concert
when
she
let
herself
into
the
house
that
evening
she
with
delicious
secret
almost
as
though
she
were
coming
home
from
date
miles
was
already
in
the
kitchen
still
in
his
work
suit
with
the
phone
in
his
hand
he
stared
at
her
as
she
entered
and
his
expression
was
strange
difficult
to
read
what
said
samantha
little
can
get
hold
of
dad
said
miles
his
bloody
phone
there
been
another
post
and
when
samantha
looked
he
said
with
trace
of
impatience
barry
fairbrother
ghost
another
message
on
the
council
website
oh
said
samantha
her
scarf
right
yeah
met
just
now
coming
up
the
street
she
was
full
of
it
ve
checked
the
message
board
but
can
see
it
mum
must
ve
taken
it
down
already
well
bloody
hope
she
has
she
ll
be
in
the
line
if
bends
your
ear
goes
to
lawyer
about
parminder
jawanda
was
it
asked
samantha
her
tone
deliberately
casual
she
did
not
ask
what
the
had
been
first
because
she
was
determined
not
to
be
gossiping
old
bag
like
shirley
and
maureen
and
because
she
thought
she
already
knew
that
parminder
had
caused
the
death
of
old
cath
weedon
after
moment
or
two
she
asked
vaguely
amused
did
you
say
your
mother
might
be
in
the
line
well
she
the
site
administrator
so
she
if
she
doesn
get
rid
of
or
not
sure
she
and
dad
understand
how
serious
this
could
be
you
could
your
mother
she
like
that
but
miles
had
not
heard
he
was
pressing
and
scowling
because
his
father
mobile
was
still
this
is
getting
serious
he
said
you
were
all
quite
happy
when
it
was
simon
price
who
was
getting
attacked
why
this
any
different
if
it
campaign
against
anyone
on
the
council
or
standing
for
council
samantha
turned
away
to
hide
her
grin
his
concern
was
not
about
shirley
after
all
but
why
would
anyone
write
stuff
about
you
she
asked
you
haven
got
any
guilty
secrets
you
might
be
more
bloody
interesting
if
you
had
what
about
that
letter
what
letter
for
god
mum
and
dad
said
there
was
letter
an
anonymous
letter
about
me
saying
wasn
fit
to
fill
barry
fairbrother
shoes
samantha
opened
the
freezer
and
stared
at
the
contents
aware
that
miles
could
no
longer
see
her
expression
with
the
door
open
you
don
think
anyone
got
anything
on
you
do
you
she
asked
no
but
lawyer
aren
there
might
be
people
with
grudge
don
think
this
kind
of
anonymous
stuff
mean
so
far
it
all
about
the
other
side
but
there
could
be
don
like
the
way
this
thing
going
well
that
politics
miles
said
samantha
openly
amused
dirty
business
miles
out
of
the
room
but
she
did
not
care
her
thoughts
had
already
returned
to
cheekbones
eyebrows
and
taut
tight
muscles
she
could
along
with
most
of
the
now
she
would
buy
band
shirt
to
wear
and
one
for
libby
too
would
be
mere
yards
away
from
her
it
would
be
more
fun
than
she
had
had
in
years
howard
meanwhile
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
closed
delicatessen
with
his
mobile
phone
to
his
ear
the
were
down
the
lights
were
on
and
through
the
in
the
wall
shirley
and
maureen
were
busy
in
the
soon
to
be
opened
caf√©
china
and
glasses
talking
in
excited
and
half
listening
to
howard
almost
to
his
conversation
yes
yes
screaming
at
me
said
shirley
screaming
and
swearing
take
it
bloody
down
she
said
said
taking
it
down
dr
jawanda
and
ll
thank
you
not
to
swear
at
me
ve
left
it
up
there
for
another
couple
of
hours
if
she
at
me
said
maureen
shirley
smiled
as
it
happened
she
had
chosen
to
go
and
make
herself
cup
of
tea
leaving
the
anonymous
post
about
parminder
up
on
the
site
for
an
extra
forty
five
minutes
before
it
she
and
maureen
had
already
picked
over
the
of
the
post
until
it
was
and
bare
there
was
plenty
of
for
further
but
the
immediate
urge
was
instead
shirley
looked
ahead
to
parminder
reaction
to
having
her
secret
spilt
in
public
it
can
have
been
her
who
did
that
post
about
simon
price
after
all
said
maureen
no
obviously
not
said
shirley
as
she
wiped
over
the
pretty
blue
and
white
china
that
she
had
chosen
maureen
for
pink
sometimes
though
not
directly
involved
in
the
business
shirley
liked
to
remind
maureen
that
she
still
had
huge
influence
as
howard
wife
yes
said
howard
on
the
telephone
but
wouldn
it
be
better
to
so
who
do
you
think
it
is
asked
maureen
really
don
know
said
shirley
in
voice
as
though
such
knowledge
or
suspicions
were
beneath
her
someone
who
knows
the
and
the
jawandas
said
maureen
obviously
said
shirley
again
howard
hung
up
at
last
aubrey
he
told
the
two
women
through
into
the
caf√©
he
was
clutching
today
edition
of
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette
very
weak
piece
very
weak
indeed
it
took
the
two
women
several
seconds
to
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
interested
in
the
article
by
barry
fairbrother
in
the
local
newspaper
his
ghost
was
so
much
more
interesting
oh
yes
well
thought
it
was
very
poor
when
read
it
said
shirley
up
the
interview
with
krystal
weedon
was
funny
maureen
making
out
she
enjoyed
art
suppose
that
what
she
calls
graffiti
the
desks
howard
laughed
as
an
excuse
to
turn
her
back
shirley
picked
up
andrew
price
spare
from
the
counter
which
ruth
had
dropped
into
the
delicatessen
that
morning
shirley
had
looked
up
on
her
favourite
medical
website
and
felt
fully
competent
to
explain
how
worked
nobody
asked
though
so
she
put
the
small
white
tube
away
in
the
cupboard
and
closed
the
door
as
as
she
could
to
try
and
maureen
further
the
phone
in
howard
huge
hand
rang
yes
hello
oh
miles
yes
yes
we
know
all
about
it
mum
saw
it
this
morning
he
laughed
yes
she
taken
it
down
don
know
think
it
was
yesterday
oh
wouldn
say
that
we
ve
all
known
about
bends
your
ear
for
years
but
howard
faded
as
miles
talked
after
while
he
said
ah
yes
see
yes
no
hadn
considered
it
from
perhaps
we
should
get
someone
to
have
look
at
security
the
sound
of
car
in
the
square
outside
went
virtually
by
the
three
in
the
delicatessen
but
its
driver
noticed
the
enormous
shadow
of
howard
mollison
moving
behind
the
cream
gavin
put
his
foot
down
to
get
to
mary
she
had
sounded
desperate
on
the
telephone
who
doing
this
who
doing
it
who
me
this
much
nobody
you
he
had
said
who
could
hate
you
stay
there
coming
over
he
parked
outside
the
house
slammed
the
door
and
hurried
up
the
she
opened
the
front
door
before
he
had
even
knocked
her
eyes
were
puffy
with
tears
again
and
she
was
wearing
floor
length
dressing
gown
that
her
it
was
not
at
all
the
very
of
kay
scarlet
but
its
its
very
represented
new
level
of
intimacy
mary
four
children
were
all
in
the
sitting
room
mary
him
through
into
the
kitchen
do
they
know
he
asked
her
fergus
does
somebody
at
school
told
him
ve
asked
him
not
to
tell
the
others
gavin
about
at
the
end
of
my
the
spite
it
isn
true
he
said
and
then
his
curiosity
getting
the
better
of
him
is
it
no
she
said
outraged
mean
don
know
don
really
know
her
but
to
make
him
talk
like
that
putting
the
words
in
his
mouth
don
they
care
what
it
like
for
me
she
dissolved
into
tears
again
he
felt
that
he
shouldn
her
while
she
was
wearing
her
dressing
gown
and
was
glad
that
he
had
not
when
eighteen
year
old
fergus
entered
the
kitchen
moment
later
gav
the
boy
looked
tired
older
than
his
years
gavin
watched
him
put
an
arm
around
mary
and
saw
her
her
head
against
his
shoulder
mopping
her
eyes
on
her
sleeve
like
child
don
think
it
was
the
same
person
fergus
told
them
without
ve
been
looking
at
it
again
the
of
the
message
is
different
he
had
it
on
his
mobile
phone
and
began
to
read
aloud
parish
councillor
dr
parminder
jawanda
who
to
be
so
keen
on
looking
after
the
poor
and
of
the
area
has
always
had
secret
motive

mary

at
the
kitchen

as
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
sobbed
silently
gavin
noticed
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette
lying
there
he
never
read
it
without
asking
or
offering
he
moved
across
to
the
cupboard
to
make
her
drink
thanks
gav
she
said
when
he
pushed
the
glass
into
her
hand
it
might
be
howard
mollison
suggested
gavin
sitting
down
beside
her
from
what
barry
said
about
him
don
think
so
said
mary
at
her
eyes
it
so
crude
he
never
did
anything
like
that
when
barry
was
she
alive
and
then
she
snapped
at
her
son

that
paper
away
fergus
the
boy
looked
confused
and
hurt

got
dad

it
away
said
mary
with
an
edge
of
in
her
voice
can
read
it
off
the
computer
if
want
to
the
last
thing
he
ever
did
on
our
anniversary
fergus
took
the
newspaper
off
the
table
and
stood
for
moment
watching
his
mother
who
had
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
again
then
with
glance
at
gavin
he
walked
out
of
the
room
still
holding
the
gazette
after
while
when
gavin
judged
that
fergus
was
not
coming
back
he
put
out
hand
and
rubbed
mary
arm
they
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
and
gavin
felt
much
happier
with
the
newspaper
gone
from
the
table
ii
parminder
was
not
supposed
to
be
working
the
next
morning
but
she
had
meeting
in
yarvil
once
the
children
had
left
for
school
she
moved
around
the
house
making
sure
that
she
had
everything
she
needed
but
when
the
telephone
rang
she
jumped
so
much
that
she
dropped
her
bag
yes
she
almost
frightened
tessa
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
was
taken
aback
minda
it
me
are
you
all
right
yes
yes
the
phone
made
me
said
parminder
looking
at
the
kitchen
floor
now
with
keys
papers
loose
change
and
what
is
it
nothing
really
said
tessa
just
calling
for
chat
see
how
you
are
the
subject
of
the
anonymous
post
hung
between
them
like
some
dangling
from
the
line
parminder
had
barely
allowed
tessa
to
talk
about
it
during
yesterday
call
she
had
shouted
it
lie
filthy
lie
and
don
tell
me
howard
mollison
didn
do
it
tessa
had
not
dared
the
subject
can
talk
said
parminder
ve
got
meeting
in
yarvil
case
review
for
little
boy
on
the
at
risk
oh
right
sorry
maybe
later
yes
said
parminder
great
goodbye
she
up
the
contents
of
her
bag
and
hurried
from
the
house
running
back
from
the
garden
gate
to
check
that
she
had
closed
the
front
door
properly
every
so
often
as
she
drove
she
realized
that
she
had
no
recollection
of
travelling
the
last
mile
and
told
herself
to
concentrate
but
the
words
of
the
anonymous
post
kept
coming
back
to
her
she
already
knew
them
by
heart
parish
councillor
dr
parminder
jawanda
who
to
be
so
keen
on
looking
after
the
poor
and
of
the
area
has
always
had
secret
motive
until
died
she
was
in
love
with
me
which
she
could
barely
hide
whenever
she
laid
eyes
on
me
and
she
would
vote
however
told
her
to
whenever
there
was
council
meeting
now
that
am
gone
she
will
be
useless
as
councillor
because
she
has
lost
her
brain
she
had
first
seen
it
the
previous
morning
when
she
opened
up
the
council
website
to
check
the
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
the
shock
had
been
almost
physical
her
breathing
had
become
very
fast
and
as
it
had
been
during
the
most
of
when
she
had
tried
to
lift
herself
over
the
pain
to
from
the
present
everyone
would
know
by
now
there
was
nowhere
to
hide
the
thoughts
kept
coming
to
her
for
what
her
grandmother
would
have
said
if
she
had
known
that
parminder
had
been
accused
of
another
woman
husband
and
to
in
public
she
could
almost
see
covering
her
face
with
fold
of
her
shaking
her
head
backwards
and
forwards
as
she
had
always
done
when
blow
had
hit
the
family
some
vikram
had
said
to
her
late
last
night
with
strange
new
to
his
smile
might
want
to
know
whether
it
was
true
of
course
it
isn
true
parminder
had
said
with
her
own
shaking
hand
over
her
mouth
how
can
you
ask
me
that
of
course
it
isn
you
knew
him
he
was
my
friend
just
friend
she
was
already
passing
the
bellchapel
addiction
clinic
how
had
she
travelled
so
far
without
it
she
was
becoming
dangerous
driver
she
was
not
paying
attention
she
remembered
the
evening
that
she
and
vikram
had
gone
to
the
restaurant
nearly
twenty
years
ago
the
night
they
had
agreed
to
marry
she
had
told
him
about
all
the
the
family
had
made
when
she
had
walked
home
with
and
he
had
agreed
how
silly
it
was
he
had
understood
then
but
he
did
not
understand
when
it
was
howard
mollison
who
accused
her
instead
of
her
own
relatives
apparently
he
did
not
realise
that
could
be
narrow
and
and
full
of
she
had
missed
the
turning
she
must
concentrate
she
must
pay
attention
am
late
she
called
as
she
hurried
at
last
across
the
car
park
towards
kay
bawden
she
had
met
the
social
worker
once
before
when
she
had
come
in
for
of
her
for
the
not
at
all
said
kay
thought
show
you
up
to
the
office
because
it
warren
in
here
kay
led
her
down
shabby
deserted
corridor
into
meeting
room
three
more
women
were
already
sitting
there
they
greeted
parminder
with
smiles
this
is
who
works
with
robbie
mother
at
bellchapel
said
kay
sitting
down
with
her
back
to
the
windows
and
this
is
my
and
this
is
who
the
road
nursery
dr
parminder
jawanda
robbie
gp
kay
added
parminder
accepted
coffee
the
other
four
women
began
talking
without
her
parish
councillor
dr
parminder
jawanda
who
to
be
so
keen
on
looking
after
the
poor
and
of
the
area
who
to
be
so
keen
you
bastard
howard
mollison
but
he
had
always
seen
her
as
barry
had
said
so
he
thinks
that
because
came
from
the
fields
want
pagford
by
but
you
re
proper
professional
class
so
he
doesn
think
you
ve
got
any
right
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
fields
he
thinks
you
re
or
making
trouble
for
fun
understand
why
the
family
registered
with
gp
in
pagford
said
one
of
the
three
unfamiliar
social
workers
whose
names
parminder
had
already
forgotten
several
families
in
the
fields
are
registered
with
us
said
parminder
at
once
but
wasn
there
some
trouble
with
the
weedons
and
their
previous
yeah
the
cantermill
practice
threw
them
out
said
kay
in
front
of
whom
sat
pile
of
notes
than
either
of
her
colleagues
terri
nurse
there
so
they
ve
been
registered
with
you
how
long
nearly
five
years
said
parminder
who
had
looked
up
all
the
details
at
the
surgery
she
had
seen
howard
in
church
at
barry
funeral
pretending
to
with
his
big
fat
hands
clasped
in
front
of
him
and
the
fawleys
beside
him
parminder
knew
what
were
supposed
to
believe
in
love
neighbour
as
if
howard
had
been
more
honest
he
would
have
turned
sideways
and
to
aubrey
until
died
she
was
in
love
with
me
which
she
could
barely
hide
whenever
she
laid
eyes
on
me
had
she
really
not
been
able
to
hide
it
last
seen
him
parminder
asked
kay
when
his
sister
brought
him
in
for
for
an
ear
said
parminder
about
eight
weeks
ago
and
how
was
his
physical
condition
then
asked
one
of
the
other
women
well
he
not
to
said
parminder
of
notes
from
her
handbag
checked
him
quite
because
well
know
the
family
history
he
good
weight
although
doubt
his
anything
to
write
home
about
no
or
or
anything
of
that
description
his
bottom
was
bit
sore
and
remember
his
sister
said
that
he
still
himself
sometimes
they
keep
putting
him
back
in
said
kay
but
you
wouldn
asked
the
woman
who
had
first
questioned
parminder
have
any
major
concerns
health
wise
there
was
no
sign
of
said
parminder
remember
took
off
his
to
check
and
there
were
no
or
other
injuries
there
no
man
in
the
house
kay
and
this
ear
her
parminder
you
said
it
was
the
sister
who
brought
him
in
not
the
mother
are
you
terri
doctor
too
don
think
we
ve
seen
terri
for
five
years
said
parminder
and
the
turned
to
instead
how
she
doing
on
methadone
until
died
she
was
in
love
with
me
parminder
thought
perhaps
it
shirley
or
maureen
who
the
ghost
not
howard
they
would
be
much
more
likely
to
watch
her
when
she
was
with
barry
hoping
to
see
something
with
their
dirty
old
minds
she
lasted
on
the
programme
so
far
said
she
mentioned
the
case
review
quite
lot
get
the
feeling
she
knows
that
this
is
it
that
she
running
out
of
chances
she
doesn
want
to
lose
robbie
she
said
that
few
times
have
to
say
you
ve
got
through
to
her
kay
really
do
see
her
taking
some
responsibility
for
the
situation
for
the
first
time
since
ve
known
her
thank
you
but
not
going
to
get
over
excited
the
situation
still
pretty
kay
words
were
at
odds
with
her
tiny
smile
of
satisfaction
how
are
things
going
at
nursery
well
he
back
again
said
the
fourth
social
worker
he
been
in
full
for
the
past
three
weeks
which
is
dramatic
change
the
teenage
sister
him
his
clothes
are
too
small
and
usually
dirty
but
he
about
bath
and
meal
times
at
home
and
he
his
language
skills
are
very
poor
he
doesn
like
men
coming
into
the
nursery
when
turn
up
he
won
go
near
them
he
around
the
nursery
workers
and
very
anxious
and
once
or
twice
she
said
turning
page
in
her
notes
he
what
are
clearly
sexual
on
or
near
little
girls
don
think
whatever
we
decide
there
can
be
any
question
of
taking
him
off
the
at
risk
said
kay
to
murmur
of
agreement
it
sounds
like
everything
on
terri
staying
on
your
programme
said
the
to
and
staying
off
the
game
that
key
certainly
kay
agreed
but
concerned
that
even
when
she
heroin
free
she
doesn
provide
much
to
robbie
krystal
seems
to
be
raising
him
and
she
sixteen
and
got
plenty
of
her
own
issues
parminder
remembered
what
she
had
said
to
sukhvinder
couple
of
nights
previously
krystal
weedon
that
stupid
girl
is
that
what
being
in
team
with
krystal
weedon
taught
you
to
sink
to
her
level
barry
had
liked
krystal
he
had
seen
things
in
her
that
were
invisible
to
other
people
eyes
once
long
ago
parminder
had
told
barry
the
story
of
the
who
had
to
the
needs
of
those
in
whether
friend
or
when
asked
why
he
gave
aid
had
replied
that
the
light
of
god
shone
from
every
soul
and
that
he
had
been
unable
to
between
them
the
light
of
god
shone
from
every
soul
she
had
called
krystal
weedon
stupid
and
implied
that
she
was
low
barry
would
never
have
said
it
she
was
ashamed
when
there
was
great
grandmother
who
seemed
to
provide
some
back
up
in
care
but
she
died
said
parminder
rushing
to
say
it
before
anyone
else
could
and
stroke
yeah
said
kay
still
looking
at
her
notes
so
we
go
back
to
terri
she
came
out
of
care
herself
has
she
ever
attended
classes
we
offer
them
but
she
never
been
in
fit
state
to
attend
said
the
woman
from
the
nursery
if
she
agreed
to
take
them
and
actually
turned
up
it
would
be
massive
step
forward
said
kay
if
they
close
us
down
sighed
from
bellchapel
parminder
suppose
she
ll
have
to
come
to
you
for
her
methadone
concerned
that
she
wouldn
said
kay
before
parminder
could
answer
what
do
you
mean
asked
parminder
the
other
women
stared
at
her
just
that
and
remembering
appointments
isn
terri
said
kay
she
only
has
to
walk
up
the
road
to
bellchapel
oh
said
parminder
yes
sorry
yes
you
re
probably
right
she
had
thought
that
kay
was
making
to
the
complaint
about
catherine
weedon
death
that
she
did
not
think
terri
weedon
would
trust
her
concentrate
on
what
they
re
saying
what
wrong
with
you
so
big
picture
said
the
looking
down
at
her
notes
we
ve
got
with
some
care
she
sighed
but
there
was
more
than
in
the
sound
the
immediate
is
over
she
stopped
using
robbie
back
in
nursery
where
we
can
keep
proper
eye
on
him
and
there
no
immediate
concern
for
his
safety
as
kay
says
he
on
the
at
risk
certainly
think
we
ll
need
another
meeting
in
four
weeks
it
was
another
forty
minutes
before
the
meeting
broke
up
kay
walked
parminder
back
down
to
the
car
park
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
come
in
person
most
send
through
report
it
was
my
morning
off
said
parminder
she
meant
it
as
an
explanation
for
her
because
she
hated
sitting
at
home
alone
with
nothing
to
do
but
kay
seemed
to
think
that
she
was
asking
for
more
and
gave
it
at
parminder
car
kay
said
you
re
the
parish
councillor
aren
you
did
colin
pass
you
the
figures
on
bellchapel
gave
him
yes
he
did
said
parminder
it
would
be
good
to
have
talk
about
that
some
time
it
on
the
agenda
for
the
next
meeting
but
when
kay
had
given
her
her
number
and
left
with
thanks
parminder
thoughts
to
barry
the
ghost
and
the
mollisons
she
was
driving
through
the
fields
when
the
simple
thought
that
she
had
tried
to
to
out
slipped
past
her
lowered
at
last
perhaps
did
love
him
iii
andrew
had
spent
hours
deciding
which
clothes
he
ought
to
wear
for
his
first
day
work
at
the
copper
kettle
his
final
choice
was
draped
over
the
back
of
the
chair
in
his
bedroom
particularly
angry
acne
had
chosen
to
bring
itself
to
shiny
tight
on
his
left
cheek
and
andrew
had
gone
so
far
as
to
with
ruth
which
he
had
out
of
her
dressing
table
drawer
he
was
laying
the
kitchen
table
on
friday
evening
his
mind
full
of
gaia
and
the
seven
solid
hours
of
close
proximity
to
her
that
were
within
touching
distance
when
his
father
returned
from
work
in
state
that
andrew
had
never
seen
before
simon
seemed
subdued
almost
where
your
mother
ruth
came
out
of
the
walk
in
hello
si
pie
how
what
wrong
they
ve
made
me
ruth
clapped
her
hands
to
her
face
in
horror
then
to
her
husband
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
drew
him
close
why
she
whispered
that
message
said
simon
on
that
fucking
website
they
pulled
in
and
too
it
was
take
or
we
ll
sack
you
and
it
deal
it
not
even
what
they
gave
andrew
stood
perfectly
still
slowly
into
of
guilt
fuck
said
simon
into
ruth
shoulder
you
ll
get
something
else
she
whispered
not
round
here
said
simon
he
sat
down
on
kitchen
chair
still
in
his
coat
and
stared
across
the
room
apparently
too
stunned
to
speak
ruth
around
him
and
andrew
was
glad
to
in
simon
gaze
whiff
of
his
usual
ham
it
made
him
feel
slightly
less
guilty
he
continued
to
lay
the
table
without
saying
word
dinner
was
subdued
affair
paul
of
the
family
news
looked
terrified
as
though
his
father
might
him
of
causing
it
all
simon
acted
like
through
the
first
course
but
in
the
face
of
but
then
ll
pay
someone
to
punch
the
fucker
fat
face
through
the
back
of
his
neck
he
burst
out
as
he
into
himself
and
the
family
knew
that
he
meant
howard
mollison
you
know
there
been
another
message
on
that
council
website
said
ruth
breathlessly
it
not
only
you
who
had
it
si
somebody
told
me
at
work
the
same
person
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
has
put
up
something
horrible
about
dr
jawanda
so
howard
and
shirley
got
someone
in
to
look
at
the
site
and
he
realized
that
whoever
doing
these
messages
has
been
using
barry
fairbrother
in
details
so
to
be
safe

minutes
andrew
was
unnerved
by
what
his
mother
had
said
it
was
that
was
being
and
that
somebody
else
had
followed
his
lead
who
else

thought
of

table
at
his
eldest
son

si
simon
pushed

chair
away
from
the
table
threw
down
his
own
spoon
which
onto
the
floor
with
clatter
and
from
the
room
slamming
the
door
behind
him
andrew
waited
for
the
inevitable
and
was
not
disappointed

when
the
alarm
rang
at
six
thirty
the
next

andrew
slammed
it
off
within
seconds
and
virtually
out
of
bed
feeling
as
though
it
was
christmas
day
he
washed
and
dressed
at
speed
then
spent
forty
minutes
on
his
hair
and
face
of
onto
the
most
obvious
of
his
he
half
expected
simon
to
him
as
he
crept
past
his
parents
room
but
he
met
nobody
and
after
breakfast
he
wheeled
simon
racing
out
of
the
garage
and
sped
off
down
the
hill
towards
pagford
it
was
morning
that
promised
sunshine
later
the

still
down
in
the
delicatessen
but
the
door
tinkled
and
gave
when

pushed

howard
towards
him

by
narrow
tiny
patch
of
stone
yard
by
high
walls
with
sized
metal
and
that
led
down
steps
to

up
somewhere
there
out
of

way
said
howard
who
had
appeared
at
the
back
door
wheezing
and
sweaty
faced
while
andrew
fumbled
with
the
on
the
chain
howard
dabbed
at
his
forehead
with
his
apron
right
we
ll
start
with
the
he
said
when
andrew
had
secured
the
he
pointed
at
the
get
down
there
and
see
the
he
bent
over
the
as
andrew
climbed
down
the
steps
howard
had
not
been
able
to
climb
down
into
his
own
for
years
maureen
usually
up
and
down
the
steps
couple
of
times
week
but
now
that
it
was
fully
with
goods
for
the
caf√©
younger
legs

have
good
look
around
he
shouted
at
the
out
of
sight

where
we
ve
got

and
all
the
baked
goods
see
the
big
bags
of
coffee
and
the
boxes
of
and
in
the
corner
the
toilet
rolls
and
the
bin
bags
yeah
andrew
voice
echoed
up
from
the
you
can
call
me
mr
mollison
said
howard
with
slightly
edge
to
his
voice
down
in
the
andrew
wondered
whether
he
ought
to
start
straight
away
ok
mr
mollison
it
sounded
he
to
make
with
polite
question
what
in
these
big
cupboards
have
look
said
howard
that
what
you
re
down
there
for
to
know
where
you
put
everything
and
where
you
get
it
from
howard
listened
to
the
muffled
sounds
of
andrew
opening
the
heavy
doors
and
hoped
that
the
boy
would
not
prove
or
need
lot
of
direction
howard
was
particularly
bad
today
the
was
high
on
top
of
all
the
extra
work
and
the
excitement
and
petty
of
the
opening
the
way
he
was
sweating
he
might
need
to
ring
shirley
to
bring
him
new
shirt
before
they
unlocked
the
doors
here
the
van
howard
shouted
hearing
at
the
other
end
of
the
get
up
here
you
re
to
carry
the
stuff
down
to
the
and
put
it
away
all
right
and
bring
couple
of
of
milk
through
to
me
in
the
caf√©
you
got
that
yeah
mr
mollison
said
andrew
voice
from
below
howard
walked
slowly
back
inside
to
fetch
the
that
he
kept
in
his
jacket
which
was
hanging
up
in
the
staff
room
behind
the
delicatessen
counter
several
deep
later
he
felt
much
better
wiping
his
face
on
his
apron
again
he
sat
down
on
one
of
the
chairs
to
rest
several
times
since
he
had
been
to
see
her
about
his
skin
rash
howard
had
thought
about
what
dr
jawanda
had
said
about
his
weight
that
it
was
the
source
of
all
his
health
problems
nonsense
obviously
look
at
the
boy
built
like
and
shocking
howard
had
always
been
big
as
far
back
as
he
could
remember
in
the
very
few
photographs
taken
of
him
with
his
father
who
had
left
the
family
when
howard
was
four
or
five
he
was
merely
after
his
father
had
left
his
mother
had
sat
him
at
the
head
of
the
table
between
herself
and
his
grandmother
and
been
hurt
if
he
did
not
take
seconds
steadily
he
had
grown
to
fill
the
space
between
the
two
women
as
heavy
at
twelve
as
the
father
who
had
left
them
howard
had
come
to
appetite
with
his
was
one
of
his
it
had
been
built
with
pleasure
by
the
women
who
loved
him
and
he
thought
it
was
absolutely
of
bends
your
ear
that
that
she
wanted
to
strip
him
of
it
but
sometimes
in
moments
of
when
it
became
difficult
to
breathe
or
to
move
howard
knew
fear
it
was
all
very
well
for
shirley
to
act
as
though
he
had
never
been
in
danger
but
he
remembered
long
nights
in
the
hospital
after
his
bypass
when
he
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
for
worry
that
his
heart
might
and
stop
whenever
he
caught
sight
of
vikram
jawanda
he
remembered
that
those
long
dark
fingers
had
actually
touched
his
naked
beating
heart
the
with
which
he
at
each
encounter
was
way
of
driving
out
that
instinctive
terror
they
had
told
him
at
the
hospital
afterwards
that
he
needed
to
lose
some
weight
but
he
had
dropped
two
stone
naturally
while
he
was
forced
to
live
off
their
dreadful
food
and
shirley
had
been
on
him
up
again
once
he
was
out
howard
sat
for
moment
more
enjoying
the
ease
with
which
he
breathed
after
using
his
today
meant
great
deal
to
him
thirty
five
years
previously
he
had
introduced
fine
dining
to
pagford
with
the
of
century
returning
with
from
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
pagford
after
had
soon
begun
to
nose
and
into
his
he
thought
of
his
late
mother
who
had
been
so
proud
of
him
and
his
business
he
wished
that
she
could
have
seen
the
caf√©
howard
heaved
himself
back
to
his
feet
took
his
deerstalker
from
its
and
placed
it
carefully
on
his
head
in
an
act
of
self
his
new

at
half
past
