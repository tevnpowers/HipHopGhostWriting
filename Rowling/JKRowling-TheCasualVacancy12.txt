mahogany
doors
shirley
from
place

place
setting
out
papers

council
meetings
quite
apart
from
the
pride
and
she
from
listening
to
howard
chair
them
maureen

necessarily
absent
with
no
official
role
she
had
to
be
content
with
the
shirley
to
share
howard
fellow
councillors
arrived
and
in
pairs
he
boomed
out
his
voice
from
the
the
full
of
sixteen
councillors
rarely
attended
he
was
expecting
twelve
of
them
today
the
table
was
half
full
when
aubrey
fawley
arrived
walking
as
he
always
did
as
if
into
high
wind
with
an
air
of
slightly
his
head
aubrey
called
howard

for
the
first
time
he
moved
forward
to
the
newcomer

he
away
full
of
vague
parminder
jawanda
entered
as
he
approached
the
door
scowling
as
usual
she
walked
straight
past
without
greeting
him
and
for
once
howard
did
not
ask
how
parminder
out
on
the
pavement
he
found
young
blonde
woman
and
square
with
an
of
that
howard
recognized
immediately
as
determination
of
his
own
brand
she
was
holding
notebook
and
looking
up
at
the
sweetlove
initials
carved
over
the
double
doors
hello

howard
his
breathing

up
all
the
she

moving
towards
the
door
as
she
spoke
yes
yes
press
are
allowed
said
howard
following
her
and
pausing
at
the
entrance
to
let
her
through
first
unless
we
have
to
deal
with
anything
in
camera
that
is
she
glanced
back
at
him
and
he
could
make
out
her
teeth
even
in
the
light
like
all
those
anonymous
on
your
message
board
from
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
oh
dear
howard
smiling
back
at
her
they
re
not
news
surely
couple
of
silly
comments
on
the
internet
has
it
only
been
couple
somebody
told
me
the
of
them
had
been
taken
off
the
site
no
no
somebody
got
that
wrong
said
howard
there
have
only
been
two
or
three
to
my
knowledge
nasty
nonsense
personally
he
said
on
the
spot
think
it
some
kid
kid
you
know
having
fun
would
teenagers
parish
councillors
she
asked
still
smiling
heard
actually
that
one
of
the
victims
has
lost
his
job
possibly
as
result
of
the
made
against
him
on
your
site
news
to
me
said
howard
shirley
had
seen
ruth
at
the
hospital
the
previous
day
and
reported
back
to
him
see
on
the
agenda
said
as
the
pair
of
them
entered
the
brightly
lit
hall
that
you
ll
be
discussing
bellchapel
you
and
mr
fairbrother
made
good
on
both
sides
of
the
argument
in
your
we
had
quite
few
letters
to
the
paper
after
we
printed
mr
fairbrother
piece
my
liked
that
anything
that
makes
people
write
letters
yes
saw
those
said
howard
nobody
seemed
to
have
much
good
to
say
about
the
clinic
did
they
the
councillors
at
the
table
were
watching
the
pair
of
them
returned
their
gaze
still
smiling
let
me
get
you
chair
said
howard
slightly
as
he
lifted
one
down
from
and
settling
some
twelve
feet
from
the
table
thank
you
she
pulled
it
six
feet
forward
ladies
and
called
howard
we
ve
got
press
gallery
here
tonight
miss
of
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette
few
of
them
seemed
interested
and
by
appearance
but
most
looked
suspicious
howard
back
to
the
head
of
the
table
where
aubrey
and
shirley
were
questioning
him
with
their
eyes
barry
fairbrother
ghost
he
told
them
in
an
as
he
lowered
himself
into
the
plastic
chair
one
of
them
had
collapsed
under
him
two
meetings
ago
and
bellchapel
and
there
he
shouted
making
aubrey
come
on
in
we
ll
give
and
another
couple
of
minutes
shall
we
the
murmur
of
talk
around
the
table
was
slightly
more
subdued
than
usual
was
already
writing
in
her
notebook
howard
thought
this
is
all
bloody
fairbrother
fault
he
was
the
one
who
had
invited
the
press
in
for
split
second
howard
thought
of
barry
and
the
ghost
as
one
and
the
same
alive
and
dead
like
shirley
parminder
had
brought
of
papers
with
her
to
the
meeting
and
these
were
piled
up
underneath
the
agenda
she
was
pretending
to
read
so
that
she
did
not
have
to
speak
to
anybody
in
reality
she
was
thinking
about
the
woman
sitting
almost
directly
behind
her
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette
had
written
about
catherine
weedon
and
the
family
against
their
gp
parminder
had
not
been
named
but
doubtless
the
journalist
knew
who
she
was
perhaps
had
got
wind
of
the
anonymous
post
about
parminder
on
the
parish
council
website
too
calm
down
you
re
getting
like
colin
howard
was
already
taking
and
asking
for
to
the
last
set
of
minutes
but
parminder
could
barely
hear
over
the
sound
of
her
own
blood
in
her
ears
now
unless
anybody
got
any
said
howard
we
re
going
to
deal
with
eight
and
nine
first
because
district
councillor
fawley
got
news
on
both
and
he
can
stay
long
got
until
eight
thirty
said
aubrey
checking
his
watch
yes
so
unless
there
are
no
floor
yours
aubrey
aubrey
stated
the
position
simply
and
without
emotion
there
was
new
boundary
review
coming
and
for
the
first
time
there
was
an
appetite
beyond
pagford
to
the
fields
to
yarvil
pagford
relatively
small
costs
seemed
to
those
who
hoped
to
add
anti
government
votes
to
yarvil
where
they
might
make
difference
as
opposed
to
being
wasted
in
pagford
which
had
been
safe
seat
since
the
the
whole
thing
could
be
done
under
the
of
and
yarvil
provided
almost
all
services
for
the
place
as
it
was
aubrey
by
saying
that
it
would
be
helpful
should
pagford
wish
to
cut
the
estate
away
for
the
town
to
express
its
for
the
benefit
of
the
district
council
good
clear
message
from
you
he
said
and
really
think
that
this
time
it
never
worked
before
said
to
muttered
agreement
well
now
john
we
ve
never
been
invited
to
state
our
position
before
said
howard
shouldn
we
decide
what
our
position
is
before
we
it
asked
parminder
in
an
icy
voice
all
right
said
howard
would
you
like
to
kick
off
dr
jawanda
don
know
how
many
people
saw
barry
article
in
the
gazette
said
parminder
every
face
was
turned
towards
her
and
she
tried
not
to
think
about
the
anonymous
post
or
the
journalist
sitting
behind
her
thought
it
made
the
arguments
for
keeping
the
fields
part
of
pagford
very
well
parminder
saw
shirley
who
was
writing
give
her
pen
tiny
smile
by
telling
us
the
likes
of
krystal
weedon
benefit
said
an
elderly
woman
called
from
the
end
of
the
table
parminder
had
always
her
by
us
that
people
living
in
the
fields
are
part
of
our
community
too
she
answered
they
think
of
themselves
as
from
yarvil
said
the
always
have
remember
said
when
krystal
weedon
pushed
another
child
into
the
river
on
nature
walk
no
she
didn
said
parminder
my
daughter
was
there
that
was
two
boys
who
were
fighting
anyway
heard
it
was
krystal
weedon
said
you
heard
wrong
said
parminder
except
that
she
did
not
say
it
she
shouted
it
they
were
shocked
she
had
shocked
herself
the
off
the
old
walls
parminder
could
barely
she
kept
her
head
down
staring
at
the
agenda
and
heard
john
voice
from
long
way
off
barry
would
ve
done
better
to
talk
about
himself
not
that
girl
he
got
lot
out
of
st
thomas
trouble
is
for
every
barry
said
another
woman
you
get
of
they
re
yarvil
people
bottom
line
said
man
they
belong
to
yarvil
that
not
true
said
parminder
keeping
her
voice
deliberately
low
but
they
all
fell
silent
to
listen
to
her
waiting
for
her
to
shout
again
it
simply
not
true
look
at
the
weedons
that
was
the
whole
point
of
barry
article
they
were
pagford
family
going
back
years
but
they
moved
to
yarvil
said
there
was
no
here
said
parminder
fighting
her
own
temper
none
of
you
wanted
new
development
on
the
of
town
you
weren
here
sorry
said
pink
in
the
face
looking
away
from
parminder
you
don
know
the
history
talk
had
become
general
the
meeting
had
broken
into
several
little
of
conversation
and
parminder
could
not
make
out
any
of
it
her
throat
was
tight
and
she
did
not
dare
meet
anyone
eyes
shall
we
have
show
of
hands
howard
shouted
down
the
table
and
silence
fell
again
those
in
favour
of
telling
the
district
council
that
pagford
will
be
happy
for
the
parish
boundary
to
be
to
take
the
fields
out
of
our
parminder
fists
were
clenched
in
her
lap
and
the
of
both
her
hands
were
in
their
there
was
of
sleeves
all
around
her
excellent
said
howard
and
the
in
his
voice
rang
from
the
well
ll
something
with
and
and
we
ll
send
it
round
for
everyone
to
see
and
we
ll
get
it
off
excellent
couple
of
councillors
clapped
parminder
vision
and
she
hard
the
agenda
in
and
out
of
focus
the
silence
went
on
so
long
that
finally
she
looked
up
howard
in
his
excitement
had
had
to
his
and
most
of
the
councillors
were
watching
all
right
then
howard
putting
the
away
again
red
in
the
face
and
beaming
unless
anyone
got
anything
else
to
add
an
pause
nine
bellchapel
and
aubrey
got
something
to
tell
us
here
too
barry
wouldn
have
let
it
happen
he
have
he
have
made
john
laugh
and
vote
with
us
he
ought
to
have
written
about
himself
not
krystal
ve
let
him
down
thank
you
howard
said
aubrey
as
the
blood
pounded
in
parminder
ears
and
she
her
still
more
deeply
into
her
as
you
know
we
re
having
to
make
some
pretty
cuts
at
district
level
she
was
in
love
with
me
which
she
could
barely
hide
whenever
she
laid
eyes
on
me
and
one
of
the
we
ve
got
to
look
at
is
bellchapel
said
aubrey
thought
have
word
because
as
you
all
know
it
the
parish
that
owns
the
building
and
the
lease
is
almost
up
said
howard
that
right
but
nobody
else
is
interested
in
that
old
place
are
they
asked
retired
accountant
from
the
end
of
the
table
it
in
bad
state
from
what
ve
heard
oh
sure
we
could
find
new
said
howard
comfortably
but
that
not
really
the
issue
the
point
is
whether
we
think
the
clinic
is
doing
good
that
not
the
point
at
all
said
parminder
cutting
across
him
it
isn
the
parish
council
job
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
clinic
doing
good
job
we
don
their
work
they
re
not
our
responsibility
but
we
own
the
building
said
howard
still
smiling
still
polite
so
think
it
natural
for
us
to
want
to
consider
if
we
re
going
to
look
at
information
on
the
clinic
work
think
it
very
important
that
we
get
balanced
picture
said
parminder
sorry
said
shirley
blinking
down
the
table
at
parminder
but
could
you
try
not
to
the
chair
dr
jawanda
it
difficult
to
take
notes
if
people
talk
over
other
people
and
now
ve
interrupted
she
added
with
smile
sorry
the
parish
wants
to
keep
getting
from
the
building
said
parminder
ignoring
shirley
and
we
have
no
other
lined
up
as
far
as
know
so
wondering
why
we
are
even
the
clinic
lease
they
don
them
said
they
just
give
them
more
drugs
be
very
happy
to
see
them
out
we
re
having
to
make
some
very
difficult
decisions
at
district
council
level
said
aubrey
fawley
the
government
looking
for
more
than
in
from
local
government
we
continue
to
provide
services
the
way
we
have
done
that
the
reality
parminder
hated
the
way
that
her
fellow
councillors
acted
around
aubrey
drinking
in
his
deep
voice
gently
as
he
talked
she
was
well
aware
that
some
of
them
called
her
bends
your
ear
that
drug
use
during
said
parminder
it
their
choice
said
nobody
makes
them
take
drugs
she
looked
around
the
table
for
support
shirley
smiled
at
her
we
re
having
to
make
some
choices
said
aubrey
so
you
ve
got
together
with
howard
parminder
talked
over
him
and
decided
that
you
can
give
the
clinic
little
push
by
forcing
them
out
of
the
building
can
think
of
better
ways
to
spend
money
than
on
bunch
of
said
the
accountant
cut
off
all
their
personally
said
was
invited
to
this
meeting
to
put
you
all
in
the
picture
about
what
happening
at
district
level
said
aubrey
calmly
nothing
more
than
that
dr
jawanda
said
howard
loudly
pointing
to
another
councillor
whose
hand
was
raised
and
who
had
been
trying
to
make
her
views
heard
for
minute
parminder
heard
nothing
of
what
the
woman
said
she
had
quite
forgotten
about
the
of
papers
lying
underneath
her
agenda
on
which
kay
bawden
had
spent
so
much
time
the
the
of
successful
cases
the
explanation
of
the
of
methadone
as
against
heroin
showing
the
cost
financial
and
social
of
heroin
addiction
everything
around
her
had
become
slightly
liquid
she
knew
that
she
was
going
to
as
she
had
never
erupted
in
her
life
and
there
was
no
room
to
regret
it
or
to
prevent
it
or
do
anything
except
watch
it
happen
it
was
too
late
far
too
late
of
said
aubrey
fawley
people
who
have
not
worked
day
in
their
lives
and
let
face
it
said
howard
this
is
problem
with
simple
solution
stop
taking
the
drugs
he
turned
smiling
and
to
parminder
they
call
it
cold
isn
that
right
dr
jawanda
oh
you
think
that
they
should
take
responsibility
for
their
addiction
and
change
their
behaviour
said
parminder
in
yes
before
they
cost
the
state
any
more
money
and
you
said
parminder
loudly
as
the
silent
her
do
you
know
how
many
of
thousands
of
pounds
you
howard
mollison
have
cost
the
health
service
because
of
your
total
to
stop
yourself
rich
red
was
spreading
up
howard
neck
into
his
cheeks
do
you
know
how
much
your
bypass
cost
and
your
drugs
and
your
long
stay
in
hospital
and
the
doctor
appointments
you
take
up
with
your
and
your
blood
pressure
and
the
nasty
skin
rash
which
are
all
caused
by
your
to
lose
weight
as
parminder
voice
became
scream
other
councillors
began
to
protest
on
howard
shirley
was
on
her
feet
parminder
was
still
shouting
together
the
papers
that
had
somehow
been
as
she
what
about
patient
shouted
shirley
absolutely
parminder
was
at
the
door
of
the
hall
and
striding
through
it
and
she
heard
over
her
own
furious
sobs
calling
for
her
immediate
from
the
council
she
was
half
running
away
from
the
hall
and
she
knew
that
she
had
done
something
and
she
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
be
swallowed
up
by
the
darkness
and
to
for
ever

and

side
of

what
had
been

pagford

than
the
original
we
should
have
up
security
on
the
site
as
soon
as
that
first
post
appeared
he
said
his
wife
and
business
partner
from
in
front
of
his
gas
fire
silent
spring
rain
the
window
and
the
back
lawn
with
tiny
red
of
light
howard
was
feeling
and
was
all
the
heat
from
the
for
several
days
nearly
every
visitor
to
the
delicatessen
and
the
café
had
been
gossiping
about
the
anonymous
about
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
and
about
parminder
jawanda
at
the
council
meeting
howard
hated
the
things
that
she
had
shouted
being
about
in
public
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
uncomfortable
in
his
own
shop
and
concerned
about
his
previously
position
in
pagford
the
election
for
the
replacement
of
barry
fairbrother
would
take
place
the
following
day
and
where
howard
had
felt
and
excited
he
was
worried
and
this
has
done
lot
of
damage
lot
of
damage
he
repeated
his
hand
to
his
belly
to
but
he
pulled
it
away
the
with
expression
he
would
not
soon
forget
what
dr
jawanda
had
screamed
to
the
council
and
the
press
he
and
shirley
had
already
checked
the
details
of
the
general
medical
council
gone
to
see
dr
and
made
formal
complaint
parminder
had
not
been
seen
at
work
since
so
no
doubt
she
was
already
her
howard
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
sight
of
her
expression
as
she
screamed
at
him
it
had
shaken
him
to
see
such
hatred
on
another
human
face
it
ll
all
blow
over
said
shirley
not
so
sure
said
howard
not
so
sure
it
doesn
make
us
look
good
the
council
rows
in
front
of
the
press
we
look
divided
aubrey
says
they
re
not
happy
at
district
level
this
whole
thing
our
statement
about
the
fields
in
public
everything
getting
dirty
it
doesn
look
like
the
council
speaking
for
the
town
but
we
are
said
shirley
with
little
laugh
nobody
in
pagford
wants
the
fields
hardly
anyone
the
article
makes
it
look
like
our
side
went
after
pro
fielders
tried
to
them
said
howard
to
the
temptation
to
and
doing
it
all
right
aubrey
knows
it
wasn
any
of
our
side
but
that
not
how
that
journalist
made
it
look
and
ll
tell
you
this
if
yarvil
makes
us
look
or
dirty
they
ve
been
looking
for
chance
to
take
us
over
for
years
that
won
happen
said
shirley
at
once
that
couldn
happen
thought
it
was
over
said
howard
ignoring
his
wife
and
thinking
of
the
fields
thought
we
done
it
thought
we
got
rid
of
them
the
article
over
which
he
had
spent
so
much
time
why
the
estate
and
the
bellchapel
addiction
clinic
were
and
on
pagford
had
been
completely
by
the
of
parminder
and
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
howard
had
completely
forgotten
now
how
much
pleasure
the
against
simon
price
had
given
him
and
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
remove
them
until
price
wife
had
asked
district
council
emailed
me
he
told
maureen
with
bunch
of
questions
about
the
website
they
want
to
hear
what
steps
we
ve
taken
against
they
think
the
security
shirley
who
detected
personal
in
all
of
this
said
coldly
ve
told
you
ve
taken
care
of
it
howard
the
of
friends
of
howard
and
shirley
had
come
round
the
previous
day
while
howard
was
at
work
the
boy
was
halfway
through
degree
in
computing
his
to
shirley
had
been
that
they
take
down
the
immensely
website
bring
in
someone
who
knows
what
they
re
doing
and
set
up
new
one
shirley
had
understood
barely
one
word
in
ten
of
the
that
the
young
man
had
at
her
she
knew
that
meant
to
and
when
the
student
stopped
talking
his
she
was
left
with
the
confused
impression
that
the
ghost
had
somehow
managed
to
find
out
people
maybe
by
questioning
them
in
casual
conversation
she
had
therefore
emailed
everybody
to
request
that
they
change
their
and
make
sure
not
to
share
the
new
one
with
anybody
this
was
what
she
meant
by
ve
taken
care
of
it
as
to
the
suggestion
of
closing
down
the
site
of
which
she
was
and
she
had
taken
no
steps
nor
had
she
mentioned
the
idea
to
howard
shirley
was
afraid
that
site
containing
all
the
security
that
the
young
man
had
suggested
would
be
way
beyond
the
of
her
and
skills
she
was
already
stretched
to
the
of
her
and
she
was
determined
to
to
the
post
of
administrator
if
miles
is
shirley
began
but
maureen
interrupted
in
her
deep
voice
let
hope
it
hasn
hurt
him
this
nasty
stuff
let
hope
there
isn
against
him
people
will
know
miles
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
shirley
coolly
will
they
though
said
maureen
and
shirley
simply
hated
her
how
dare
she
sit
in
shirley
and
her
and
what
was
worse
howard
was
his
agreement
with
maureen
that
my
worry
he
said
and
we
need
miles
more
than
ever
now
get
some
back
on
the
council
after
bends
your
ear
said
what
she
said
after
all
the
we
didn
even
take
the
vote
on
bellchapel
we
need
miles
shirley
had
already
walked
out
of
the
room
in
silent
protest
at
howard
with
maureen
she
herself
with
the
in
the
kitchen
silently
wondering
why
she
did
not
set
out
only
two
cups
to
give
maureen
the
hint
that
she
so
deserved
shirley
continued
to
feel
nothing
but
admiration
for
the
ghost
his
had
exposed
the
truth
about
people
whom
she
disliked
and
despised
people
who
were
and
wrong
headed
she
was
sure
that
the
of
pagford
would
see
things
her
way
and
vote
for
miles
rather
than
that
man
colin
wall
when
shall
we
go
and
vote
shirley
asked
howard
re
entering
the
room
with
the
tea
tray
and
ignoring
maureen
for
it
was
their
son
whose
name
they
would
on
the
but
to
her
intense
irritation
howard
suggested
that
all
three
of
them
go
after
closing
time
miles
mollison
was
quite
as
concerned
as
his
father
that
the
ill
humour
next
day
vote
would
his
chances
that
very
morning
he
had
entered
the
newsagent
behind
the
square
and
caught
of
conversation
between
the
woman
behind
the
till
and
her
elderly
mollison
always
thought
he
was
of
pagford
the
old
man
was
saying
oblivious
to
the
wooden
expression
on
the
face
liked
barry
fairbrother
tragedy
that
was
tragedy
the
mollison
boy
did
our
wills
and
thought
he
was
very
pleased
with
himself
miles
had
lost
his
at
that
and
slipped
back
out
of
the
shop
his
face
like
schoolboy
he
wondered
whether
the
well
spoken
old
man
was
the
of
that
anonymous
letter
miles
comfortable
belief
in
his
own
was
shaken
and
he
kept
trying
to
imagine
how
it
would
feel
if
nobody
for
him
the
following
day
as
he
for
bed
that
night
he
watched
his
silent
wife
reflection
in
the
dressing
table
mirror
for
days
samantha
had
been
nothing
but
if
he
mentioned
the
election
he
could
have
done
with
some
support
some
comfort
this
evening
he
also
felt
it
had
been
long
time
thinking
back
he
supposed
that
it
had
been
the
night
before
barry
fairbrother
dropped
dead
she
had
been
little
bit
drunk
it
often
took
little
bit
of
drink
these
days
how
was
work
he
asked
watching
her
her
bra
in
the
mirror
samantha
did
not
answer
immediately
she
rubbed
the
deep
red
in
the
flesh
beneath
her
arms
left
by
the
tight
bra
then
said
without
looking
at
miles
ve
been
meaning
to
talk
to
you
about
that
actually
she
hated
having
to
say
it
she
had
been
trying
to
avoid
doing
so
for
several
weeks
thinks
ought
to
close
the
shop
it
not
doing
well
exactly
how
badly
the
shop
was
doing
would
be
shock
to
miles
it
had
been
shock
to
her
when
her
accountant
had
laid
out
the
position
in
the
terms
she
had
both
known
and
not
known
it
was
strange
how
your
brain
could
know
what
your
heart
refused
to
accept
oh
said
miles
but
you
keep
the
website
yeah
she
said
we
keep
the
website
well
that
good
said
miles
he
waited
for
almost
minute
out
of
respect
for
the
death
of
her
shop
then
he
said
don
suppose
you
saw
the
gazette
today
she
reached
over
for
the
on
her
pillow
and
he
had
glimpse
of
her
breasts
sex
would
definitely
help
him
it
real
shame
sam
he
said
across
the
bed
behind
her
and
waiting
to
put
his
arms
around
her
as
she
into
the
about
the
shop
it
was
great
little
place
and
you
ve
had
it
what
ten
years
fourteen
said
samantha
she
knew
what
he
wanted
she
considered
telling
him
to
go
and
himself
and
to
the
spare
room
but
the
trouble
was
that
there
would
then
be
row
and
an
atmosphere
and
what
she
wanted
more
than
anything
in
the
world
was
to
be
able
to
head
off
to
london
with
libby
in
two
days
time
wearing
the
shirts
that
she
had
bought
them
both
and
to
be
within
close
proximity
of
and
his
band
mates
for
whole
evening
this
constituted
the
entire
sum
of
samantha
happiness
what
was
more
sex
might
miles
continuing
that
she
was
missing
howard
birthday
party
so
she
let
him
and
then
kiss
her
she
closed
her
eyes
climbed
on
top
of
him
and
imagined
herself
on
deserted
white
beach
nineteen
years
old
to
his
twenty
one
she
came
while
imagining
miles
watching
them
furiously
through
from
distant
at
nine
clock
on
the
morning
of
the
election
for
barry
seat
parminder
left
the
old
vicarage
and
walked
up
church
row
to
the
walls
house
she
on
the
door
and
waited
until
at
last
colin
appeared
there
were
shadows
around
his
bloodshot
eyes
and
beneath
his
cheekbones
his
skin
seemed
to
have
and
his
clothes
grown
too
big
he
had
not
yet
returned
to
work
the
news
that
parminder
had
screamed
confidential
medical
information
about
howard
in
public
had
set
back
his
recovery
the
more
colin
of
few
nights
ago
who
had
sat
on
the
leather
and
pretended
to
be
confident
of
might
never
have
been
is
everything
all
right
he
asked
closing
the
door
behind
her
looking
wary
yes
fine
she
said
thought
you
might
like
to
walk
down
the
church
hall
with
me
to
vote
no
he
said
sorry

how
you
feel
colin
said
parminder
in
small
tight
voice
but
if
you
don
vote
it
means
they
ve
won
not
going
to
let
them
win
going
to
go
down
there
and
vote
for
you
and
want
you
to
come
with
me
parminder
was
from
work
the
mollisons
had
complained
to
every
professional
body
for
which
they
could
find
an
address
and
dr
had
parminder
to
take
time
off
to
her
great
surprise
she
felt
strangely
but
colin
was
shaking
his
head
she
thought
she
saw
tears
in
his
eyes
can
minda
you
can
she
said
you
can
colin
you
ve
got
to
stand
up
to
them
think
of
barry
can
sorry
he
made
noise
and
burst
into
tears
colin
had
cried
in
her
surgery
before
now
sobbed
in
desperation
at
the
burden
of
fear
he
carried
with
him
every
day
of
his
life
come
on
she
said
and
she
took
his
arm
and
him
through
to
the
kitchen
where
she
handed
him
kitchen
roll
and
let
him
sob
himself
into
again
where
tessa
at
work
he
gasped
mopping
his
eyes
there
was
an
invitation
to
howard
mollison
sixty
fifth
birthday
party
lying
on
the
kitchen
table
somebody
had
it
neatly
in
two
got
one
of
those
as
well
said
parminder
before
shouted
at
him
listen
colin
can
whispered
colin
shows
them
they
haven
beaten
us
but
they
have
said
colin
parminder
burst
out
laughing
after
contemplating
her
with
his
mouth
open
for
moment
colin
started
to
laugh
too
big
booming
like
the
of
all
right
they
ve
run
us
out
of
our
jobs
said
parminder
and
neither
of
us
wants
to
leave
the
house
but
other
than
that
think
we
re
in
very
good
shape
indeed
colin
took
off
his
glasses
and
dabbed
his
wet
eyes
grinning
come
on
colin
want
to
vote
for
you
it
isn
over
yet
after
blew
my
top
and
told
howard
mollison
he
was
no
better
than
in
front
of
the
whole
council
and
the
local
press
he
burst
out
laughing
again
and
she
was
delighted
she
had
not
heard
him
laugh
so
much
since
new
year
and
then
it
had
been
barry
making
him
do
it
they
forgot
to
vote
on
forcing
the
addiction
clinic
out
of
bellchapel
so
please
get
your
coat
we
ll
walk
down
there
together
colin
and
died
away
he
stared
down
at
the
big
hands
fumbled
over
each
other
as
if
he
were
washing
them
clean
colin
it
not
over
you
ve
made
difference
people
don
like
the
mollisons
if
you
get
in
we
be
in
much
stronger
position
to
fight
please
colin
all
right
he
said
after
few
moments
by
his
own
daring
it
was
short
walk
in
the
fresh
clean
air
each
of
them
clutching
their
cards
the
church
hall
was
empty
of
voters
apart
from
themselves
each
put
thick
cross
beside
colin
name
and
left
with
the
sense
that
they
had
got
away
with
something
miles
mollison
did
not
vote
until
midday
he
paused
at
his
partner
door
on
the
way
out
off
to
vote
gav
he
said
gavin
indicated
the
telephone
pressed
against
his
ear
he
was
on
hold
with
mary
insurance
company
oh
right
off
to
vote
said
miles
turning
to
their
secretary
there
was
no
harm
in
them
both
that
he
was
in
need
of
their
support
miles
downstairs
and
proceeded
to
the
copper
kettle
where
during
brief
post
chat
he
had
arranged
to
meet
his
wife
so
that
they
could
go
down
to
the
church
hall
together
samantha
had
spent
the
morning
at
home
leaving
her
assistant
in
charge
at
the
shop
she
knew
that
she
could
no
longer
put
off
telling
that
they
were
out
of
business
and
that
was
out
of
job
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
do
it
before
the
weekend
and
the
concert
in
london
when
miles
appeared
and
she
saw
his
excited
little
grin
she
experienced
rush
of
fury
dad
not
coming
were
his
first
words
they
re
going
down
after
closing
time
said
samantha
there
were
two
old
ladies
in
the
when
she
and
miles
got
there
samantha
waited
looking
at
the
backs
of
their
iron
grey
their
thick
coats
and
their
that
was
how
she
would
look
one
day
the
more
of
the
two
old
women
noticed
miles
as
they
left
and
said
ve
just
for
you
well
thank
you
very
much
said
miles
delighted
samantha
entered
the
and
stared
down
at
the
two
names
miles
mollison
and
colin
wall
the
tied
to
the
end
of
piece
of
in
her
hand
then
she
hate
bloody
pagford
across
the
paper
folded
it
over
crossed
to
the
box
and
dropped
it
unsmiling
through
the
thanks
love
said
miles
quietly
with
on
her
back
tessa
wall
who
had
never
failed
to
vote
in
an
election
before
drove
past
the
church
hall
on
her
way
back
home
from
school
and
did
not
stop
ruth
and
simon
price
spent
the
day
talking
more
seriously
than
ever
about
the
possibility
of
moving
to
reading
ruth
threw
out
their
cards
while
clearing
the
kitchen
table
for
supper
gavin
had
never
intended
to
vote
if
barry
had
been
alive
to
stand
he
might
have
done
so
but
he
had
no
desire
to
help
miles
achieve
another
of
his
life
at
half
past
five
he
packed
up
his
briefcase
and
depressed
because
he
had
finally
run
out
of
excuses
not
to
have
dinner
at
kay
it
was
particularly
because
there
were
hopeful
signs
that
the
insurance
company
was
in
mary
favour
and
he
had
very
much
wanted
to
go
over
and
tell
her
so
this
meant
that
he
would
have
to
store
up
the

gavin
sat
down
at
the
table
that
kay
would
make
gaia
turn
the
music
down
she
had
virtually
to
shout
at
him
over
the
of
the
the
rattling
and
the
he
again
for
the
calm
of
mary
big
kitchen
for
mary
her
need

tell
that

just
asked
him

said
did
you
vote
vote
in
the
council
election
she
said
no
he
replied
couldn
care
less
he
was
not
sure
whether
she
had
heard
she
was
talking
again
and
only
when
she
turned
to
the
table
with
and
could
he
hear
her
clearly
absolutely
actually
that
the
parish
is
with
aubrey
fawley
expect
bellchapel
will
be
finished
if
miles
gets
in
she
drained
the
potatoes
and
the
and
crash
drowned
her
temporarily
again
if
that
silly
woman
hadn
lost
her
temper
we
might
be
in
with
better
shot
gave
her
of
stuff
on
the
clinic
and
don
think
she
used
any
of
it
she
just
screamed
at
howard
mollison
that
he
was
too
fat
talk
about
gavin
had
heard
about
dr
jawanda
public
he
had
found
it
all
this
very
to
the
people
who
work
at
that
clinic
not
to
mention
the
clients
but
gavin
could
neither
pity
nor
all
he
felt
was
at
the
firm
grip
kay
seemed
to
have
on
the
and
involved
in
this
local
issue
it
was
yet
another
of
how
she
was
driving
deeper
and
deeper
into
pagford
it
would
take
lot
to
her
now
he
turned
his
head
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
onto
the
garden
beyond
he
had
offered
to
help
fergus
with
mary
garden
this
weekend
with
luck
he
thought
mary
would
invite
him
to
stay
for
dinner
again
and
if
she
did
he
would
howard
mollison
sixty
fifth
birthday
party
to
which
miles
seemed
to
think
he
was
looking
forward
with
excitement
wanted
to
keep
the
weedons
but
no
says
we
can
pick
would
you
call
that
picking
sorry
what
asked
gavin
mattie
back
she
said
and
he
had
to
struggle
to
that
this
was
colleague
of
hers
whose
cases
she
had
been
covering
wanted
to
keep
working
with
the
weedons
because
sometimes
you
do
get
particular
feeling
for
family
but
won
let
me
it
you
must
be
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
ever
wanted
to
keep
the
weedons
said
gavin
from
what
ve
heard
anyway
it
took
nearly
all
kay
not
to
at
him
she
pulled
the
she
had
been
out
of
the
gaia
music
was
so
loud
that
she
could
feel
it
through
the
tray
which
she
slammed
down
on
the
gaia
she
screamed
making
gavin
as
she
strode
past
him
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
gaia
turn
it
down
mean
it
turn
it
down
the
diminished
by
perhaps
kay
marched
back
into
the
kitchen
the
row
with
gaia
before
gavin
arrived
had
been
one
of
their
worst
ever
gaia
had
stated
her
intention
of
her
father
and
asking
to
move
in
with
him
well
good
luck
with
that
kay
had
shouted
but
perhaps
would
say
yes
he
had
left
her
when
gaia
was
only
month
old
was
married
now
with
three
other
children
he
had
huge
house
and
good
job
what
if
he
said
yes
gavin
was
glad
that
he
did
not
have
to
talk
as
they
ate
the
music
filled
the
silence
and
he
could
think
about
mary
in
peace
he
would
tell
her
tomorrow
that
the
insurance
company
was
making
noises
and
receive
her
and
admiration
he
had
almost
cleared
his
plate
when
he
realized
that
kay
had
not
eaten
single
mouthful
she
was
staring
at
him
across
the
table
and
her
expression
him
perhaps
he
had
somehow
revealed
his
inner
thoughts
gaia
music
came
to
an
the
quiet
was
dreadful
to
gavin
he
wished
that
gaia
would
put
something
else
on
quickly
you
don
even
try
kay
said
miserably
you
don
even
pretend
to
care
gavin
he
attempted
to
take
the
easy
way
out
kay
ve
had
long
day
he
said
sorry
if
not
up
to
the
of
local
politics
the
second
walk
not
talking
about
local
politics
she
said
you
sit
there
looking
as
if
you
rather
be
anywhere
else
it
it
what
do
you
want
gavin
he
saw
mary
kitchen
and
her
sweet
face
have
to
to
see
you
kay
said
and
when
you
come
round
here
you
couldn
make
it
that
you
don
want
to
come
she
wanted
him
to
say
that
not
true
the
last
point
at
which
denial
might
have
counted
past
they
were
sliding
at
speed
towards
that
which
gavin
both
urgently
and
dreaded
tell
me
what
you
want
she
said
just
tell
me
both
could
feel
the
relationship
to
pieces
beneath
the
weight
of
everything
that
gavin
refused
to
say
it
was
with
sense
of
putting
them
both
out
of
their
misery
that
he
reached
for
words
that
he
had
not
intended
to
speak
aloud
perhaps
ever
but
which
in
some
way
seemed
to
excuse
both
of
them
didn
want
this
to
happen
gavin
said
didn
mean
it
to
kay
really
sorry
but
think
in
love
with
mary
fairbrother
he
saw
from
her
expression
that
she
had
not
been
prepared
for
this
mary
fairbrother
she
repeated
think
he
said
and
there
was
pleasure
in
talking
about
it
even
though
he
knew
he
was
her
he
had
not
been
able
to
say
it
to
anyone
else
it
been
there
for
long
time
never
acknowledged
mean
when
barry
was
alive
never
have
thought
he
was
your
best
friend
whispered
kay
he
was
he
only
been
dead
few
weeks
gavin
did
not
like
hearing
that
look
he
said
trying
to
be
honest
with
you
trying
to
be
fair
you
re
trying
to
be
fair
he
had
always
imagined
it
ending
in
blaze
of
fury
but
she
simply
watched
him
putting
on
his
coat
with
tears
in
her
eyes
sorry
he
said
and
walked
out
of
her
house
for
the
last
time
on
the
pavement
he
experienced
rush
of
and
hurried
to
his
car
he
would
be
able
to
tell
mary
about
the
insurance
company
tonight
after
all
person
who
has
made
statement
may
claim
for
it
if
he
can
show
that

seventh
edition
terri
weedon
was
used
to
people
leaving
her
the
first
and
departure
had
been
her
mother
who
had
never
said
goodbye
but
had
simply
walked
out
one
day
with
suitcase
while
terri
was
at
school
there
had
been
of
social
workers
and
care
workers
after
she
ran
away
at
fourteen
and
some
of
them
had
been
nice
enough
but
they
all
left
at
the
end
of
the
working
day
every
fresh
departure
added
fine
new
to
the
building
over
her
core
she
had
had
friends
in
care
but
at
sixteen
they
were
all
on
their
own
and
life
had
them
she
met
and
she
bore
him
two
children
tiny
little
pink
things
and
beautiful
like
nothing
in
the
whole
world
and
they
had
come
out
of
her
and
for
shining
hours
in
the
hospital
twice
it
had
been
like
her
own
and
then
they
took
the
children
from
her
and
she
never
saw
them
again
either
had
left
her
nana
cath
had
left
her
nearly
everybody
went
hardly
anyone
stayed
she
ought
to
be
used
to
it
by
now
when
mattie
her
regular
social
worker
reappeared
terri
demanded
where
the
other
one
kay
she
was
only
covering
for
me
while
was
ill
said
mattie
so
where
no
mean
robbie
don
terri
did
not
like
mattie
for
one
thing
she
did
not
have
kids
and
how
could
people
who
didn
have
kids
tell
you
how
to
raise
them
how
could
they
understand
she
had
not
liked
kay
exactly
either
except
that
kay
gave
you
funny
feeling
the
same
feeling
that
nana
cath
had
once
given
terri
before
she
had
called
her
whore
and
told
her
she
never
wanted
to
see
her
again
you
felt
with
kay
even
though
she
carried
like
the
rest
of
them
even
though
she
had
the
case
review
you
felt
that
she
wanted
things
to
go
right
for
you
and
not
only
for
the
forms
you
really
did
feel
that
but
she
was
gone
and
she
probably
don
even
think
about
us
now
thought
terri
furiously
on
friday
afternoon
mattie
told
terri
that
bellchapel
would
almost
certainly
close
it
she
said
briskly
they
want
to
save
money
but
methadone
treatment
with
the
district
council
pagford
wants
them
out
of
the
building
it
was
all
in
the
local
paper
maybe
you
saw
it
sometimes
she
spoke
to
terri
like
that
into
kind
of
after
all
we
re
in
this
together
small
talk
that
because
it
sat
alongside
enquiries
as
to
whether
terri
was
remembering
to
feed
her
son
but
this
time
it
was
what
she
said
rather
than
how
she
said
it
that
upset
terri
they
re
it
she
repeated
it
looks
that
way
said
mattie
but
it
won
make
any
difference
to
you
well
obviously
three
times
terri
had
upon
the
programme
at
bellchapel
the
dusty
interior
of
the
church
with
its
walls
and
its
the
bathroom
with
its
blue
light
so
you
could
not
find
and
up
in
there
had
become
familiar
and
almost
friendly
lately
she
had
begun
to
sense
in
the
workers
there
change
in
the
way
they
spoke
to
her
they
had
all
expected
her
to
fail
again
in
the
beginning
but
they
had
started
talking
to
her
the
way
kay
had
talked
as
if
they
knew
real
person
lived
inside
her
body
obviously
it
will
be
different
but
you
can
get
your
methadone
from
your
gp
instead
said
mattie
she
over
pages
in
the
file
that
was
the
state
record
of
terri
life
you
re
registered
with
dr
jawanda
in
pagford
right
pagford
why
are
you
going
all
the
way
out
there
nurse
at
cantermill
said
terri
almost
absent
mindedly
after
mattie
had
left
terri
sat
for
long
time
in
her
filthy
chair
in
the
sitting
room
at
her
until
they
the
moment
krystal
came
home
bringing
robbie
back
from
nursery
she
told
her
that
they
were
closing
bellchapel
they
ain
decided

said
krystal
with
authority
the
fuck

demanded
terri
they
re
it
and
now
they
say

gotta
go
to
fuckin
pagford
to

mother

said
terri
furiously
little
bitch
she
added
for
good
measure
if

start
fuckin

said
krystal
scarlet
in
the
face
they
ll
take
robbie
away
he
was
still
holding
krystal
hand
and
burst
into
tears
see
both
women
shouted
at
each
other
you
re
fuckin
it
to
him
shouted
krystal
an
anyway
that
doctor

do

an

terri
you

krystal
spat

her

terri
and
because
krystal
was
bigger
and
she
seized
lying
on
the
floor
and
it

yelled
krystal
an
ll
take
robbie
an
all
an
you

an
fuckin
obbo
an
make

one
she
dragged
the
robbie
out
with
her
before
terri
could
stop
her
krystal
marched
him
all
the
way
to
her
usual
forgetting
that
at
this
time
in
the
afternoon
nikki
would
still
be
hanging
around
outside
somewhere
not
at
home
it
was
nikki
mum
who
opened
the
door
in
her
uniform
he
ain
ere
she
told
krystal
firmly
while
robbie
and
tried
to
pull
his
hand
from
krystal
tight
grip
where
your
mum
home
said
krystal
and
everything
else
she
wanted
to
say
in
the
older
woman
gaze
so
she
returned
to
foley
road
with
robbie
where
terri
bitterly
grabbed
her
son
arm
pulled
him
inside
and
krystal
from
entering
ad
enough
of
him
already
ave
yeh
terri
over
robbie
fuck
off
and
she
slammed
the
door
terri
had
robbie
sleep
beside
her
on
her
own
mattress
that
night
she
lay
awake
and
thought
about
how
little
she
needed
krystal
and
for
her
as
badly
as
she
had
ever
smack
krystal
had
been
angry
for
days
the
thing
that
krystal
had
said
about
obbo
she
said
what
he
had
laughed
when
they
had
met
in
the
street
and
terri
had
muttered
something
about
krystal
being
upset
he
wouldn
have
done
it
he
couldn
have
obbo
was
one
of
the
few
people
who
had
hung
around
terri
had
known
him
since
she
was
fifteen
they
had
gone
to
school
together
hung
out
in
yarvil
while
she
was
in
care
together
beneath
the
trees
on
the
that
cut
its
way
through
the
small
patch
of
remaining
beside
the
fields
they
had
shared
their
first
joint
krystal
had
never
liked
him
thought
terri
watching
robbie
sleep
in
the
street
light
pouring
through
the
thin
curtains
just
he
done
more
for
me
than
anyone
thought
terri
defiantly
because
when
she
she
all
of
nana
cath
care
had
been
by
her
but
obbo
had
hidden
her
once
from
the
father
of
her
first
two
children
when
she
had
the
house
and
sometimes
he
gave
her
free
bags
of
smack
she
saw
them
as
his
were
more
than
the
little
house
in
hope
street
that
she
had
once
for
three
glorious
days
thought
was
home
krystal
did
not
return
on
saturday
morning
but
that
was
nothing
new
terri
knew
she
must
be
at
nikki
in
rage
because
they
were
low
on
food
and
she
was
out
of
cigarettes
and
robbie
was
whining
for
his
sister
she
into
her
daughter
room
and
kicked
her
clothes
around
searching
for
money
or
the
odd
overlooked
something
as
she
threw
aside
krystal
crumpled
old
rowing
and
she
saw
the
little
plastic
jewellery
box
with
the
rowing
that
krystal
had
won
and
tessa
wall
watch
lying
beneath
it
terri
picked
up
the
watch
and
stared
at
it
she
had
never
seen
it
before
she
wondered
where
krystal
had
got
it
her
first
was
that
krystal
had
stolen
it
but
then
she
wondered
whether
she
might
have
been
given
it
by
nana
cath
or
even
left
it
in
nana
cath
will
that
was
much
more
thought
than
the
idea
of
the
watch
being
stolen
the
idea
of
the
little
bitch
hiding
it
away
it
never
it
terri
put
the
watch
inside
the
pocket
of
her
tracksuit
bottoms
and
for
robbie
to
come
with
her
to
the
shops
it
took
ages
to
get
him
into
his
shoes
and
terri
lost
her
temper
and
slapped
him
she
wished
she
could
go
to
the
shop
alone
but
the
social
workers
did
not
like
you
leaving
kids
behind
in
the
house
even
though
you
could
get
things
done
much
quicker
without
them
where
krystal
robbie
as
she
him
out
of
the
door

almost
to
constant
criticism
and
assessment

the
sideways
glance

pretty
little
school
that

sent
horrible
letters
home
about
krystal
saying
that
her
clothes
were
too
small
and
too
dirty
that
her
behaviour
was
she
was
afraid
of
long
forgotten
relatives
emerging
from
hope
street
as
they
over
nana
cath
house
and
of
what
cheryl
would
say
if
she
knew
that
terri
had
entered
into
voluntary

the
bitch
who

killed
nana
cath

she

then
sorry

actually
she
lied
out
of
excitement
at
her
imminent
escape
touched
miles
leaned
forward
and
squeezed
her
hand
libby
appeared
in
the
kitchen
in
tears
she
was
clutching
her
mobile
in
her
hand
what
said
samantha
startled
please
will
you
call
mum
why
please
will
you
but
why
libby
because
she
wants
to
talk
to
you
because
libby
wiped
her
eyes
and
nose
on
the
back
of
her
hand
and
ve
had
big
row
please
will
you
call
her
samantha
took
the
telephone
through
to
the
sitting
room
she
had
only
the
idea
who
this
woman
was
since
the
girls
had
started
at
school
she
had
virtually
no
contact
with
their
friends
parents
so
desperately
sorry
to
do
this
said
mother
told
speak
to
you
because
ve
been
telling
her
it
not
that
libby
doesn
want
her
to
go
you
know
how
close
they
are
and
hate
seeing
them
like
this
samantha
checked
her
watch
they
needed
to
leave
in
ten
minutes
at
the
got
it
into
her
head
that
libby
had
spare
but
didn
want
to
take
her
ve
told
her
it
not
true
you
re
taking
the
because
you
don
want
libby
going
alone
aren
you
well
naturally
said
samantha
she
can
go
alone
knew
it
said
the
other
woman
she
sounded
strangely
and
absolutely
understand
your
and
would
never
suggest
it
if
didn
think
it
would
save
you
an
awful
lot
of
bother
it
just
that
the
girls
are
so
close
and
absolutely
wild
about
this
silly
group
and
think
from
what
libby
just
told
on
the
phone
that
libby
really
desperate
for
her
to
go
too
totally
understand
why
you
want
to
keep
an
eye
on
libby
but
the
thing
is
my
sister
taking
her
two
girls
so
there
would
be
an
adult
there
with
them
could
drive
libby
and
up
together
this
afternoon
we
meet
up
with
the
others
outside
the
and
we
could
all
stay
overnight
at
my
sister
place
absolutely
that
my
sister
or
will
be
with
libby
at
all
times
oh
that
so
kind
but
my
friend
said
samantha
with
strange
ringing
in
her
ears
is
expecting
us
you
see
but
if
you
still
wanted
to
go
and
visit
your
friend
all
saying
is
there
really
no
need
for
you
to
attend
is
there
if
somebody
else
is
with
the
girls
and
absolutely
desperate
really
desperate
wasn
going
to
get
involved
but
now
it
putting
strain
on
their
friendship
then
on
less
note
we
buy
the
from
you
of
course
there
was
nowhere
to
go
nowhere
to
hide
oh
said
samantha
yes
just
thought
it
might
be
nice
to
go
with
her
they
much
prefer
to
be
with
each
other
said
mother
firmly
and
you
won
have
to
down
and
hide
among
all
the
little
it
all
right
for
my
sister
she
only
five
foot
two
iii
to
gavin
disappointment
it
seemed
that
he
would
have
to
attend
howard
mollison
birthday
party
after
all
if
mary
client
of
the
firm
and
the
widow
of
his
best
friend
had
asked
him
to
stay
for
dinner
he
would
have
considered
himself
more
than
in
it
but
mary
had
not
asked
him
to
stay
she
had
family
visiting
and
she
had
been
oddly
when
he
had
turned
up
she
doesn
want
them
to
know
he
thought
taking
comfort
in
her
self
consciousness
as
she
him
towards
the
door
he
drove
back
to
the
his
conversation
with
kay
in
his
mind
thought
he
was
your
best
friend
he
only
been
dead
few
weeks
yeah
and
was
looking
after
her
for
barry
he
in
his
head
which
is
what
he
have
wanted
neither
of
us
expected
this
to
happen
barry
dead
it
can
hurt
him
now
alone
in
the
he
looked
out
clean
suit
for
the
party
because
the
invitation
said
formal
and
tried
to
imagine
little
pagford
relishing
the
story
of
gavin
and
mary
so
what
he
thought
by
his
own
is
she
supposed
to
be
alone
for
ever
it
happens
was
looking
after
her
and
in
spite
of
his
reluctance
to
attend
party
that
was
sure
to
be
and
he
was
inside
by
little
of
excitement
and
happiness
up
in
hilltop
house
andrew
price
was
his
hair
with
his
mother
blow
he
had
never
looked
forward
to
disco
or
party
as
much
as
he
had
longed
for
tonight
he
gaia
and
sukhvinder
were
being
paid
by
howard
to
serve
food
and
drinks
at
the
party
howard
had
him
uniform
for
the
occasion
white
shirt
black
trousers
and
tie
he
would
be
working
alongside
gaia
not
as
but
as
but
there
was
more
to
his
anticipation
than
this
gaia
had
split
