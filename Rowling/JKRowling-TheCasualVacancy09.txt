my
fucking
he
yelled
as
he
pulled
himself
up
and
towards
ruth
get
out
of
my
way
she
out
of
the
chair
and
watched
him
read
the
paragraph
through
again
he
kept
like
an
animal
to
clear
his
andrew
thought
that
he
might
be
able
to
his
father
as
he
sat
there
if
only
there
was
to
hand
someone
got
all
this
from
work
said
simon
as
if
he
had
just
reached
this
conclusion
and
had
not
heard
his
wife
or
son
the
on
him
he
placed
his
hands
on
the
and
turned
to
andrew
how
do
get
rid
of
it
what
you
do
fucking
computing
how
do
get
this
off
here
you
can
get
you
can
said
andrew
you
need
to
be
the
administrator
make
yourself
the
administrator
then
said
simon
jumping
up
and
pointing
andrew
into
the
swivel
chair
can
make
myself
the
administrator
said
andrew
he
was
afraid
that
simon
was
working
himself
up
into
second
of
violence
you
need
to
the
right
name
and
you
re
real
fucking
waste
of
space
aren
you
simon
shoved
andrew
in
the
middle
of
his
as
he
past
knocking
him
back
into
the
mantelpiece
pass
me
the
phone
simon
shouted
at
his
wife
as
he
sat
back
down
in
the
armchair
ruth
took
the
telephone
and
carried
it
the
few
feet
to
simon
he
ripped
it
out
of
her
hands
and
in
number
andrew
and
ruth
waited
in
silence
as
simon
called
first
and
then
the
men
with
whom
he
had
completed
the
after
hours
jobs
at
the
printworks
simon
fury
his
suspicion
of
his
own
was
down
the
telephone
in
short
full
of
paul
had
not
returned
perhaps
he
was
still
trying
to
his
nose
but
more
likely
he
was
too
scared
andrew
thought
his
brother
unwise
it
was
to
leave
only
after
simon
had
given
you
permission
his
calls
completed
simon
held
out
the
telephone
to
ruth
without
speaking
she
took
it
and
hurried
it
back
into
its
stand
simon
sat
thinking
while
his
sweating
in
the
heat
of
the
wood
with
fury
the
beating
to
which
he
had
his
wife
and
son
was
nothing
he
did
not
give
them
thought
terrible
thing
had
just
happened
to
him
and
naturally
his
rage
had
on
those
nearest
him
that
was
how
life
worked
in
any
case
ruth
the
silly
bitch
had
admitted
to
telling
shirley
simon
was
building
his
own
chain
of
evidence
as
he
thought
things
must
have
happened
some
fucker
and
he
suspected
that
gum
chewing
driver
whose
expression
as
simon
had
sped
away
from
him
in
the
fields
had
been
outraged
talking
about
him
to
the
mollisons
somehow
ruth
admission
that
she
had
mentioned
the
computer
to
shirley
made
this
seem
more
likely
and
they
the
mollisons
the
the
smooth
and
the
their
access
to
power
had
put
up
this
message
on
their
website
shirley
the
old
cow
managed
the
site
which
set
the
seal
on
the
theory
it
your
fucking
friend
simon
told
his
wet
faced
trembling
wife
it
your
fucking
shirley
she
done
this
she
got
some
dirt
on
me
to
get
me
off
her
son
case
that
who
it
is
but
si
shut
up
shut
up
you
silly
cow
thought
andrew
still
on
her
side
are
you
roared
simon
making
to
stand
again
no
ruth
and
he
sank
back
into
the
chair
glad
to
keep
the
weight
off
his
pounding
foot
the
management
would
not
be
happy
about
those
after
hours
jobs
simon
thought
he
wouldn
put
it
past
the
bloody
police
to
come
around
the
computer
desire
for
urgent
action
filled
him
you
he
said
pointing
at
andrew
that
computer
all
of
it
the
and
everything
you
re
coming
with
me
vi
things
things
things
hidden
and
disguised
the
river
over
the
of
the
stolen
computer
thrown
from
the
old
stone
bridge
at
midnight
simon
to
work
on
his
and
told
everyone
that
he
had
slipped
on
the
garden
path
ruth
pressed
ice
to
her
and
concealed
them
with
an
old
tube
of
andrew
lip
over
like
dane
tully
and
paul
had
another
on
the
bus
and
had
to
go
straight
to
the
nurse
on
arrival
at
school
shirley
mollison
who
had
been
shopping
in
yarvil
did
not
answer
ruth
repeated
telephone
calls
until
late
afternoon
by
which
time
ruth
sons
had
arrived
home
from
school
andrew
listened
to
the
one
conversation
from
the
stairs
outside
the
sitting
room
he
knew
that
ruth
was
trying
to
take
care
of
the
problem
before
simon
came
home
because
simon
was
more
than
capable
of
the
receiver
from
her
and
shouting
and
swearing
at
her
friend
just
silly
lies
she
was
saying
brightly
but
we
be
very
grateful
if
you
could
remove
it
shirley
he
and
the
cut
on
his
fat
lip
threatened
to
burst
open
again
he
hated
hearing
his
mother
asking
the
woman
for
favour
in
that
moment
he
was
annoyed
that
the
post
had
not
been
taken
down
already
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
written
it
that
he
had
caused
everything
his
mother
battered
face
his
own
cut
lip
and
the
atmosphere
of
dread
that
the
house
at
the
prospect
of
simon
return
do
understand
you
ve
got
lot
of
things
on
ruth
was
saying
but
you
can
see
how
this
might
do
simon
damage
if
people
believe
yes
ruth
sounded
tired
she
going
to
take
those
things
about
dad
off
the
site
so
that
ll
be
the
end
of
it
andrew
knew
his
mother
to
be
intelligent
and
much
around
the
house
than
his
ham
father
she
was
capable
of
her
own
living
why
didn
she
take
the
post
down
straight
away
if
you
re
friends
he
asked
following
her
into
the
kitchen
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
his
pity
for
ruth
was
mingled
with
feeling
of
frustration
that
amounted
to
anger
she
been
busy
snapped
ruth
one
of
her
eyes
was
bloodshot
from
simon
punch
did
you
tell
her
she
could
be
in
trouble
for
leaving
stuff
on
there
if
she
the
boards
we
did
that
stuff
in
ve
told
you
she
taking
it
down
andrew
said
ruth
she
was
not
frightened
of
showing
temper
to
her
sons
was
it
because
they
did
not
hit
her
or
for
some
other
reason
andrew
knew
that
her
face
must
ache
as
badly
as
his
own
so
who
you
reckon
wrote
that
stuff
about
dad
he
asked
her
she
turned
face
of
fury
upon
him
don
know
she
said
but
whoever
they
are
it
was
thing
to
do
everyone
got
something
they
like
to
hide
how
would
it
be
if
dad
put
some
of
the
things
he
knows
about
other
people
on
the
internet
but
he
wouldn
do
it
that
be
against
his
moral
code
would
it
said
andrew
you
don
know
your
father
as
well
as
you
think
you
do
shouted
ruth
with
tears
in
her
eyes
get
out
go
and
do
your
don
care
just
get
out
yet
the
of
the
post
could
not
remove
it
from
the
consciousness
of
those
who
were
interested
in
the
for
barry
seat
parminder
jawanda
had
the
message
about
simon
price
onto
her
computer
and
kept
opening
it
each
sentence
to
the
of
forensic
on
corpse
searching
for
of
howard
mollison
he
would
have
done
all
he
could
to
his
distinctive
but
she
was
sure
that
she
recognized
his
in
mr
price
is
certainly
no
stranger
to
keeping
down
costs
and
in
the
benefit
of
his
many
useful
minda
you
don
know
simon
price
said
tessa
wall
she
and
colin
were
having
supper
with
the
jawandas
in
the
old
vicarage
kitchen
and
parminder
had
started
on
the
subject
of
the
post
almost
the
moment
they
had
crossed
the
threshold
he
very
unpleasant
man
and
he
could
have
upset
any
number
of
people
don
think
it
howard
mollison
can
see
him
doing
anything
so
obvious
don
kid
yourself
tessa
said
parminder
howard
will
do
anything
to
make
sure
miles
is
you
watch
he
ll
go
for
colin
next
tessa
saw
colin
knuckles
on
his
handle
and
wished
that
parminder
would
think
before
she
spoke
she
of
anyone
knew
what
colin
was
like
she
his
vikram
was
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
table
in
silence
his
beautiful
face
fell
naturally
into
slightly
smile
tessa
had
always
been
intimidated
by
the
surgeon
as
she
was
by
all
very
good
looking
men
although
parminder
was
one
of
tessa
best
friends
she
barely
knew
vikram
who
worked
long
hours
and
involved
himself
much
less
in
pagford
matters
than
his
wife
told
you
about
the
agenda
didn
parminder
rattled
on
for
the
next
meeting
he
on
the
fields
for
us
to
pass
to
the
yarvil
doing
the
boundary
review
and
resolution
on
forcing
the
drug
clinic
out
of
their
building
he
trying
to
rush
it
all
through
while
barry
seat
empty
she
kept
leaving
the
table
to
fetch
things
opening
more
cupboard
doors
than
was
necessary
and
unfocused
twice
she
forgot
why
she
had
got
up
and
sat
down
again
empty
handed
vikram
watched
her
everywhere
she
moved
from
beneath
his
thick
rang
howard
last
night
parminder
said
and
told
him
we
ought
to
wait
until
we
re
back
up
to
the
full
of
councillors
before
we
vote
on
such
big
issues
he
laughed
he
says
we
can
wait
yarvil
wants
to
hear
our
views
he
said
with
the
boundary
review
coming
up
what
he
really
scared
of
is
that
colin
going
to
win
barry
seat
because
it
won
be
so
easy
to
it
all
on
us
then
ve
emailed
everyone
think
will
vote
with
us
to
see
if
they
can
put
pressure
on
him
to
delay
the
votes
for
one
meeting
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
parminder
added
breathlessly
the
bastard
he
not
using
barry
death
to
beat
him
not
if
can
help
it
tessa
thought
she
saw
vikram
lips
old
pagford
led
by
howard
mollison
generally
vikram
the
that
it
could
not
forget
in
his
wife
and
all
of
which
to
shirley
mollison
nostrils
had
the
whiff
of
it
was
tessa
thought
parminder
worked
hard
at
every
of
her
pagford
life
school
and
the
local
surgery
and
the
parish
council
and
her
reward
was
dislike
from
the
pagford
old
guard
vikram
who
rarely
joined
or
in
anything
was
upon
and
spoken
of
with
approval
mollison
parminder
said
pushing
food
around
her
plate
and
vikram
laid
down
his
knife
and
and
sat
back
in
his
chair
so
why
he
asked
is
he
happy
being
chair
of
the
parish
council
why
hasn
he
tried
to
get
on
the
district
council
because
he
thinks
that
pagford
is
the
of
the
snapped
parminder
you
don
understand
he
wouldn
being
chair
of
pagford
parish
council
for
being
prime
anyway
he
doesn
need
to
be
on
the
council
in
yarvil
he
already
got
aubrey
fawley
there
pushing
through
the
big
agenda
all
up
for
the
boundary
review
they
re
working
together
parminder
felt
barry
absence
like
ghost
at
the
table
he
would
have
explained
it
all
to
vikram
and
made
him
laugh
in
the
process
barry
had
been
of
howard
speech
of
his
walk
of
his
sudden
keep
telling
her
she
letting
herself
get
too
vikram
told
tessa
who
was
appalled
to
find
herself
slightly
with
his
dark
eyes
upon
her
you
know
about
this
stupid
complaint
the
old
woman
with
yes
tessa
knows
everyone
knows
do
we
have
to
discuss
it
at
the
dinner
table
snapped
parminder
and
she
jumped
to
her
feet
and
began
clearing
the
plates
tessa
tried
to
help
but
parminder
told
her
to
stay
where
she
was
vikram
gave
tessa
small
smile
of
that
made
her
stomach
she
could
not
help
remembering
as
parminder
around
the
table
that
vikram
and
parminder
had
had
an
arranged
marriage
it
only
an
through
the
family
parminder
had
told
her
in
the
early
days
of
their
friendship
and
annoyed
at
something
she
had
seen
in
tessa
face
nobody
makes
you
marry
you
know
but
she
had
spoken
at
other
times
of
the
immense
pressure
from
her
mother
to
take
husband
all
parents
want
their
kids
married
it
an
obsession
parminder
said
bitterly
colin
saw
his
plate
snatched
away
without
regret
the
in
his
stomach
was
even
worse
than
when
he
and
tessa
had
arrived
he
might
have
been
in
thick
glass
so
separate
did
he
feel
from
his
three
dining
it
was
sensation
with
which
he
was
only
too
familiar
that
of
walking
in
of
worry
by
it
watching
his
own
roll
by
the
outside
world
tessa
was
no
help
she
was
being
deliberately
cool
and
about
his
campaign
for
barry
seat
the
whole
point
of
this
supper
was
so
that
colin
could
consult
parminder
on
the
little
he
had
produced
his
tessa
was
refusing
to
get
involved
discussion
of
the
fear
that
was
slowly
him
she
was
refusing
him
an
trying
to
her
pretending
that
he
was
not
after
all
under
self
imposed
pressure
he
had
not
told
her
about
the
telephone
call
from
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette
that
he
had
received
at
school
that
day
the
journalist
on
the
end
of
the
line
had
wanted
to
talk
about
krystal
weedon
had
he
touched
her
colin
had
told
the
woman
that
the
school
could
not
possibly
discuss
and
that
krystal
must
be
approached
through
her
parents
ve
already
talked
to
krystal
said
the
voice
on
the
end
of
the
line
only
wanted
to
get
your
but
he
had
put
the
receiver
down
and
terror
had
out
everything
why
did
they
want
to
talk
about
krystal
why
had
they
called
him
had
he
done
something
had
he
touched
her
had
she
complained
the
had
taught
him
not
to
try
and
confirm
or
the
content
of
such
thoughts
he
was
supposed
to
acknowledge
their
existence
then
carry
on
as
normal
but
it
was
like
trying
not
to
the
worst
you
had
ever
known
the
public
of
simon
price
dirty
secrets
on
the
council
website
had
stunned
him
the
terror
of
exposure
which
had
dominated
so
much
of
colin
life
now
wore
face
its
features
those
of
an
with
brain
beneath
deerstalker
on
tight
grey
behind
bulging
eyes
he
kept
remembering
barry
of
the
delicatessen
owner
brain
and
of
the
of
that
bound
the
sixteen
members
of
pagford
parish
council
colin
had
often
imagined
how
he
would
find
out
that
the
game
was
up
article
in
the
paper
faces
turned
away
from
him
when
he
entered
mollison
and
lowe
the
headmistress
calling
him
into
her
office
for
quiet
word
he
had
his
thousand
times
his
shame
exposed
and
hung
around
his
neck
like
bell
so
that
no
would
be
possible
ever
again
he
would
be
he
might
end
up
in
colin
tessa
quietly
vikram
was
offering
him
wine
she
knew
what
was
going
on
inside
that
big
forehead
not
the
but
the
of
his
anxiety
had
been
constant
for
years
she
knew
that
colin
could
not
help
it
it
was
the
way
he
was
made
many
years
before
she
had
read
and
recognized
as
true
the
words
of
pity
beyond
all
telling
is
hid
at
the
heart
of
love
she
had
smiled
over
the
and
the
page
because
she
had
known
both
that
she
loved
colin
and
that
formed
huge
part
of
her
love
sometimes
though
her
wore
thin
sometimes
she
wanted
little
concern
and
reassurance
too
colin
had
erupted
into
panic
when
she
had
told
him
that
she
had
received
firm
of
type
but
once
she
had
convinced
him
that
she
was
not
in
imminent
danger
of
dying
she
had
been
taken
aback
by
how
quickly
he
dropped
the
subject
how
completely
he
himself
in
his
election
plans
that
morning
at
breakfast
she
had
tested
her
blood
sugar
with
the
for
the
first
time
then
taken
out
the
needle
and
it
into
her
own
belly
it
had
hurt
much
more
than
when
parminder
did
it
fats
had
seized
his
bowl
and
swung
round
in
his
chair
away
from
her
milk
over
the
table
the
sleeve
of
his
school
shirt
and
onto
the
kitchen
floor
colin
had
let
out
an
shout
of
as
fats
spat
his
mouthful
of
back
into
his
bowl
and
demanded
of
his
mother
have

got
to
do
that

the
bloody
table

be
so
damn
rude
and
shouted
colin
sit

up
that
mess
how
dare
you
speak
to
your
mother
like
that
tessa
the
needle
too
fast

had
made
herself
sorry
that

at
breakfast

under
the
table
where
he
was

of
kitchen
roll

colin

stu
said
tessa
but
her
eyes
were
she
had
hurt
herself
and
felt
shaken
and
angry
with
both
of
them
feelings
that
were
still
with
her
this
evening
tessa
wondered
why
parminder
did
not
vikram
concern
colin
never
noticed
when
she
was
perhaps
tessa
thought
there
something
in
this
arranged
marriage
business
my
mother
certainly
wouldn
have
chosen
colin
for
me
parminder
was
of
cut
fruit
across
the
table
for
pudding
tessa
wondered
little
what
she
would
have
offered
guest
who
was
not
and
herself
with
the
thought
of
bar
of
chocolate
lying
at
home
in
the
fridge
parminder
who
had
talked
five
times
as
much
as
anybody
else
all
through
supper
had
started
about
her
daughter
sukhvinder
she
had
already
told
tessa
on
the
telephone
about
the
girl
betrayal
she
went
through
it
all
again
at
the
table
with
howard
mollison
don
really
don
know
what
she
thinking
but
vikram
they
don
think
minda
colin
proclaimed
breaking
his
long
silence
that
teenagers
they
don
care
they
re
all
the
same
colin
what
rubbish
snapped
tessa
they
aren
all
the
same
at
all
we
be
delighted
if
stu
went
and
got
himself
saturday
job
not
that
there
the
chance
of
that
but
vikram
doesn
mind
parminder
pressed
on
ignoring
the
he
can
see
anything
wrong
with
it
can
you
vikram
answered
easily
it
work
experience
she
probably
won
make
university
there
no
shame
in
it
it
not
for
everyone
can
see
married
early
quite
happy
well
they
can
all
be
academic
can
they
no
she
certainly
isn
academic
said
parminder
who
was
almost
with
anger
and
tension
her
marks
are
absolutely
no
no
ambition
let
face
it
not
going
to
get
into
no
you
certainly
won
with
that
attitude
with
howard
mollison
oh
he
must
have
absolutely
loved
it
my
daughter
going
cap
in
hand
for
job
what
was
she
thinking
what
was
she
thinking
you
wouldn
like
it
if
stu
took
job
with
someone
like
mollison
colin
told
tessa
wouldn
care
said
tessa
be
he
was
showing
any
kind
of
work
as
far
as
can
tell
all
he
seems
to
care
about
is
computer
and
but
colin
did
not
know
that
stuart
smoked
she
broke
off
and
colin
said
actually
this
would
be
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
stuart
would
do
himself
with
somebody
he
knew
we
didn
like
to
get
at
us
he
love
that
for
sake
colin
sukhvinder
isn
trying
to
get
at
minda
said
tessa
so
you
think
being
parminder
shot
at
tessa
no
no
said
tessa
appalled
at
how
quickly
they
had
been
sucked
into
the
family
row
just
saying
there
aren
many
places
for
kids
to
work
in
pagford
are
there
and
why
does
she
need
to
work
at
all
said
parminder
raising
her
hands
in
gesture
of
furious
don
we
give
her
enough
money
money
you
yourself
is
always
different
you
know
that
said
tessa
tessa
chair
faced
wall
that
was
covered
in
photographs
of
the
jawanda
children
she
had
sat
here
often
and
had
counted
how
many
each
child
made
jaswant
eighteen
rajpal
nineteen
and
sukhvinder
nine
there
was
only
one
photograph
on
the
wall
sukhvinder
individual
the
picture
of
the
winterdown
rowing
team
on
the
day
that
they
had
beaten
st
anne
barry
had
given
all
the
parents
an
copy
of
this
picture
in
which
sukhvinder
and
krystal
weedon
were
in
the
middle
of
the
line
of
eight
with
their
arms
around
each
other
shoulders
beaming
and
jumping
up
and
down
so
that
they
were
both
slightly
barry
she
thought
would
have
helped
parminder
see
things
the
right
way
he
had
been
bridge
between
mother
and
daughter
both
of
whom
had
him
not
for
the
first
time
tessa
wondered
how
much
difference
it
made
that
she
had
not
given
birth
to
her
son
did
she
find
it
easier
to
accept
him
as
separate
individual
than
if
he
had
been
made
from
her
flesh
and
blood
her
heavy
blood
fats
had
recently
stopped
calling
her
mum
she
had
to
pretend
not
to
care
because
it
made
colin
so
angry
but
every
time
fats
said
tessa
it
was
like
needle
to
her
heart
the
four
of
them
finished
their
cold
fruit
in
silence
viii
up
in
the
little
white
house
that
sat
high
above
the
town
simon
price
and
days
passed
the
post
had
vanished
from
the
message
boards
but
simon
remained
to
his
might
seem
like
an
admission
of
guilt
the
police
had
not
come
knocking
about
the
computer
simon
half
regretted
throwing
it
off
the
old
bridge
now
on
the
other
hand
he
could
not
decide
whether
he
had
imagined
knowing
grin
from
the
man
behind
the
till
when
he
handed
over
his
credit
card
in
the
garage
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
there
was
lot
of
talk
about
at
work
and
simon
was
still
afraid
of
the
contents
of
that
post
coming
to
the
ears
that
they
might
save
themselves
pay
by
himself
and
andrew
watched
and
waited
losing
hope
every
day
he
had
tried
to
show
the
world
what
his
father
was
and
the
world
it
seemed
had
merely
andrew
had
imagined
that
someone
from
the
printworks
or
the
council
would
rise
up
and
tell
simon
firmly
no
that
he
was
not
fit
to
set
himself
up
in
with
other
people
that
he
was
and
standard
and
must
not
himself
or
his
family
yet
nothing
had
happened
except
that
simon
stopped
talking
about
the
council
or
making
telephone
calls
in
the
hope
of
votes
and
the
that
he
had
had
printed
out
of
hours
at
work
sat
in
box
in
the
porch
then
without
warning
or
came
heading
down
the
dark
stairs
in
search
of
food
on
friday
evening
andrew
heard
simon
talking
on
the
telephone
in
the
sitting
room
and
paused
to
listen
my
he
was
saying
yes
well
my
personal
circumstances
have
changed
yes
yes
yeah
that
right
ok
thank
you
andrew
heard
simon
replace
the
receiver
well
that
that
his
father
said
to
his
mother
well
out
of
it
if
that
the
kind
of
shit
they
re
throwing
around
he
heard
his
mother
return
some
muffled
and
before
andrew
had
time
to
move
simon
had
emerged
into
the
hall
below
drawn
breath
into
his
lungs
and
yelled
the
first
of
andrew
name
before
that
his
son
was
right
in
front
of
him
what
are
you
doing
simon
face
was
half
in
shadow
lit
only
by
the
light
the
sitting
room
wanted
drink
andrew
lied
his
father
did
not
like
the
boys
helping
themselves
to
food
you
start
work
with
mollison
this
weekend
don
you
yeah
right
well
you
listen
to
me
want
anything
you
can
get
on
that
bastard
you
hear
me
all
the
dirt
you
can
get
and
on
his
son
if
you
hear
anything
all
right
said
andrew
and
ll
put
it
up
on
the
fucking
website
for
them
said
simon
and
he
walked
back
into
the
sitting
room
barry
fairbrother
fucking
ghost
as
he
an
of
food
that
might
not
be
missed
off
here
there
ran
through
andrew
mind
stopped
you
you
bastard
stopped
you
he
had
done
exactly
what
he
had
set
out
to
do
simon
had
no
idea
who
had
brought
his
to
dust
the
silly
was
even
demanding
andrew
help
in
getting
his
complete
about
turn
because
when
andrew
had
first
told
his
parents
that
he
had
job
at
the
delicatessen
simon
had
been
furious
you
stupid
little
what
about
your
fucking
thought
try
not
eating
any
of
the
said
andrew
don
get
with
me
pizza
face
what
if
you
eat
one
accidentally
like
at
st
thomas
you
think
we
want
to
go
through
that
again
but
ruth
had
supported
andrew
telling
simon
that
andrew
was
old
enough
to
take
care
to
know
better
when
simon
had
left
the
room
she
had
tried
to
tell
andrew
that
simon
was
only
worried
about
him
the
only
thing
he
worried
about
is
that
he
have
to
miss
bloody
match
of
the
day
to
take
me
to
hospital
andrew
returned
to
his
bedroom
where
he
sat
food
into
his
mouth
with
one
hand
and
fats
with
the
other
he
thought
that
it
was
all
over
finished
done
with
andrew
had
never
yet
had
reason
to
the
first
tiny
of
in
which
was
contained
an
inevitable
viii
the
move
to
pagford
had
been
the
worst
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
gaia
bawden
occasional
visits
to
her
father
in
reading
london
was
all
that
she
had
ever
known
so
had
gaia
been
when
kay
had
first
said
that
she
wanted
to
move
to
tiny
west
country
town
that
it
had
been
weeks
before
she
took
the
threat
seriously
she
had
thought
it
one
of
kay
mad
ideas
like
the
two
she
had
bought
for
their
tiny
back
garden
in
hackney
killed
by
week
after
or
deciding
to
half
their
and
permanently
scar
her
own
hand
by
making
when
she
hardly
ever
cooked
from
friends
she
had
had
since
primary
school
from
the
house
she
had
known
since
she
was
eight
from
weekends
that
were
increasingly
about
every
kind
of
fun
gaia
had
been
over
her
threats
and
into
life
she
had
never
dreamed
streets
and
no
shops
open
past
six
clock
life
that
seemed
to
around
the
church
and
where
you
could
often
hear
and
nothing
else
gaia
felt
as
though
she
had
fallen
through
into
land
lost
in
time
she
and
kay
had
clung
tightly
to
each
other
all
gaia
life
for
her
father
had
never
lived
with
them
and
kay
two
had
never
been
and
growing
steadily
more
like
flat
mates
with
the
passing
years
now
though
gaia
saw
nothing
but
an
enemy
when
she
looked
across
the
kitchen
table
her
only
ambition
was
to
return
to
london
by
any
means
possible
and
to
make
kay
as
unhappy
as
she
could
in
she
could
not
decide
whether
it
would
punish
kay
more
to
fail
all
her
or
to
pass
them
and
try
and
get
her
father
to
agree
to
house
her
while
she
attended
sixth
form
college
in
london
in
the
meantime
she
had
to
exist
in
alien
where
her
looks
and
her
accent
once
instant
to
the
most
social
had
become
foreign
gaia
had
no
desire
to
become
one
of
the
popular
students
at
winterdown
she
thought
they
were
with
their
west
country
and
their
pathetic
ideas
of
what
constituted
her
determined
of
sukhvinder
jawanda
was
in
part
way
of
showing
the
in
crowd
that
she
found
them
laughable
and
partly
because
she
was
in
mood
to
feel
with
anybody
who
seemed
to
have
status
the
fact
that
sukhvinder
had
agreed
to
join
gaia
as
waitress
had
moved
their
friendship
to
different
level
in
their
next
period
of
double
gaia
as
she
had
never
done
before
and
sukhvinder
glimpsed
at
last
part
of
the
mysterious
reason
why
this
beautiful
cool
newcomer
had
selected
her
as
friend
the
focus
on
their
shared
gaia
muttered
it
so
white
here
isn
it
sukhvinder
heard
herself
saying
yeah
before
she
had
fully
considered
the
question
gaia
was
still
talking
but
sukhvinder
was
only
half
listening
so
white
she
supposed
that
it
was
at
st
thomas
she
had
been
made
to
get
up
the
only
brown
person
in
the
class
and
talk
about
the
religion
she
had
stood
at
the
front
of
the
class
and
told
the
story
of
the
religion
who
disappeared
into
river
and
was
believed
drowned
but
re
emerged
after
three
days
to
there
is
no
there
is
no
the
other
children
had
at
the
idea
of
anyone
for
three
days
sukhvinder
had
not
had
the
courage
to
point
out
that
had
died
and
then
come
back
to
life
she
had
cut
the
story
of
short
desperate
to
get
back
to
her
seat
she
had
only
ever
visited
handful
of
times
in
her
life
there
was
none
in
pagford
and
the
one
in
yarvil
was
tiny
and
dominated
according
to
her
parents
by
different
from
their
own
sukhvinder
did
not
even
know
why
that
mattered
because
she
knew
that
it
was
all
very
confusing
and
she
continued
to
enjoy
eggs
and
the
christmas
tree
and
found
the
books
that
parminder
pressed
upon
her
children
the
lives
of
the
and
the
of
extremely
difficult
to
read
because
my
mother
wanted
to
be
near
her
of
boyfriend
muttered
gaia
gavin
hughes
you
know
him
sukhvinder
shook
her
head
you
ve
probably
heard
them
shagging
said
gaia
the
whole
street
when
they
re
at
it
just
keep
your
windows
open
some
night
sukhvinder
tried
not
to
look
shocked
but
the
idea
of
her
parents
her
married
parents
having
sex
was
quite
bad
enough
gaia
herself
was
flushed
not
sukhvinder
thought
with
embarrassment
but
with
anger
he
going
to
her
she
so
he
can
wait
to
leave
after
they
ve
done
it
sukhvinder
would
never
have
talked
about
her
mother
like
this
and
nor
would
the
fairbrother
twins
still
in
theory
her
best
friends
niamh
and
siobhan
were
working
together
at
not
far
away
since
their
father
had
died
they
seemed
to
have
closed
in
on
themselves
each
other
company
away
from
sukhvinder
andrew
price
was
staring
almost
constantly
at
gaia
through
gap
in
the
white
faces
all
around
them
sukhvinder
who
had
noticed
this
thought
that
gaia
had
not
but
she
was
wrong
gaia
was
simply
not
bothering
to
back
or
herself
because
she
was
used
to
boys
staring
at
her
it
had
been
happening
since
she
was
twelve
two
boys
in
the
lower
sixth
kept
turning
up
in
the
corridors
as
she
moved
between
classes
far
more
often
than
the
law
of
would
seem
to
and
both
were
better
looking
than
andrew
however
none
of
them
could
to
the
boy
to
whom
gaia
had
lost
her
shortly
before
moving
to
pagford
gaia
could
hardly
bear
that
marco
de
luca
was
still
physically
alive
in
the
and
separated
from
her
by
hundred
and
thirty
two
miles
of
useless
space
he
eighteen
she
told
sukhvinder
he
half
he
football
really
well
he
supposed
to
be
getting
try
out
for
youth
squad
gaia
had
had
sex
with
marco
four
times
before
leaving
hackney
each
time
out
of
kay
bedside
table
she
had
half
wanted
kay
to
know
to
what
she
was
driven
to
brand
herself
on
marco
memory
because
she
was
being
forced
to
leave
him
sukhvinder
listened
fascinated
but
not
to
gaia
that
she
had
already
seen
marco
on
her
new
friend
facebook
page
there
was
nobody
like
that
in
the
whole
of
winterdown
he
looked
like
gaia
slumped
against
the
desk
playing
absent
mindedly
with
the
focus
on
the
and
across
the
room
andrew
price
continued
to
at
gaia
whenever
he
thought
fats
would
not
notice
maybe
he
ll
be
having
party
on
saturday
night
she
invited
him
she
she
won
let
him
get
up
to
anything
but
shit
wish
she
stared
at
the
desk
with
her
eyes
out
of
focus
and
sukhvinder
watched
her
at
her
good
looks
lost
in
admiration
for
her
life
the
idea
of
having
another
world
where
you
belonged
completely
where
you
had
boyfriend
and
of
cool
friends
seemed
to
her
even
if
you
had
been
removed
from
it
all
an
and
state
of
affairs
they
walked
together
to
the
shops
at
lunchtime
something
sukhvinder
almost
never
did
she
and
the
fairbrother
twins
usually
ate
in
the
as
they
hung
about
on
the
pavement
outside
the
newsagent
where
they
had
bought
sandwiches
they
heard
words
in
scream
your
fucking
mum
killed
my
all
the
winterdown
students
by
the
newsagent
looked
around
for
the
source
of
the
shouting
puzzled
and
sukhvinder
them
as
confused
as
everyone
else
then
she
spotted
krystal
weedon
who
was
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
pointing
finger
like
she
had
four
other
girls
with
her
all
of
them
along
the
pavement
in
line
held
back
by
the
traffic
your
fucking
mum
killed
my
she
gonna
get
fucking
done
and
so
are
you
sukhvinder
stomach
seemed
to
clean
away
people
were
staring
at
her
couple
of
third
year
girls
out
of
sight
sukhvinder
sensed
the
into
watchful
pack
krystal
and
her
were
dancing
on
waiting
for
break
in
the
cars
what
she
talking
about
gaia
asked
sukhvinder
whose
mouth
was
so
dry
that
she
could
not
reply
there
was
no
point
in
running
she
would
never
make
it
leanne
was
the
girl
in
their
year
all
that
seemed
to
move
in
the
world
were
the
passing
cars
giving
her
few
final
seconds
of
safety
and
then
jaswant
appeared
accompanied
by
several
sixth
year
boys
all
right
she
said
what
up
jaswant
had
not
heard
krystal
it
was
mere
luck
that
she
had
drifted
this
way
with
her
over
the
road
krystal
and
her
friends
had
gone
into
nothing
much
said
sukhvinder
with
relief
at
her
temporary
she
could
not
tell
what
was
happening
in
front
of
the
boys
two
of
them
were
nearly
six
feet
tall
all
were
staring
at
gaia
and
her
friends
moved
towards
the
newsagent
door
and
sukhvinder
with
an
urgent
look
at
gaia
followed
them
she
and
gaia
watched
through
the
window
as
krystal
and
her
moved
on
glancing
back
every
few
steps
what
was
that
about
gaia
asked
her
great
gran
was
my
mum
patient
and
she
died
said
sukhvinder
she
wanted
to
cry
so
much
that
the
muscles
in
her
throat
were
painful
silly
bitch
said
gaia
but
sukhvinder
sobs
were
born
not
only
from
the
shaky
of
fear
she
had
liked
krystal
very
much
and
she
knew
that
krystal
had
liked
her
too
all
those
on
the
canal
all
those
in
the
she
knew
the
of
krystal
back
and
shoulders
better
than
she
knew
her
own
they
returned
to
school
with
jaswant
and
her
friends
the
best
looking
of
the
boys
struck
up
conversation
with
gaia
by
the
time
they
had
turned
in
at
the
gates
he
was
her
about
her
london
accent
sukhvinder
could
not
see
krystal
anywhere
but
she
spotted
fats
wall
at
distance
along
with
andrew
price
she
would
have
known
his
shape
and
his
walk
anywhere
the
way
something
inside
you
helped
you
recognize
moving
across
floor
wave
upon
wave
of
through
her
as
she
approached
the
school
building
there
would
be
two
of
them
from
now
on
fats
and
krystal
together
everyone
knew
that
they
were
seeing
each
other
and
into
sukhvinder
mind
dropped
coloured
picture
of
herself
on
the
floor
and
krystal
and
her
kicking
her
and
fats
wall
watching
laughing
need
the
she
told
gaia
meet
you
up
there
she
into
the
first
girls
bathroom
they
passed
locked
herself
in
and
sat
down
on
the
closed
seat
if
she
could
have
died
if
she
could
have
disappeared
for
ever
but
the
solid
surface
of
things
refused
to
around
her
and
her
body
her
body
continued
in
its
way
to
live
she
heard
the
bell
for
the
start
of
afternoon
jumped
up
and
hurried
out
of
the
bathroom
were
along
the
corridor
she
turned
her
back
on
all
of
them
and
marched
out
of
the
building
other
people
krystal
did
it
and
so
did
fats
wall
if
she
could
only
get
away
and
stay
away
this
afternoon
she
might
be
able
to
think
of
something
to
her
before
she
had
to
go
back
in
or
she
could
walk
in
front
of
car
she
imagined
it
slamming
into
her
body
and
her
bones
how
quickly
would
she
die
broken
in
the
road
she
still
preferred
the
thought
of
of
cool
clean
water
putting
her
to
sleep
for
ever
sleep
without
dreams
sukhvinder
sukhvinder
her
stomach
turned
over
tessa
wall
was
hurrying
towards
her
across
the
car
park
for
one
mad
moment
sukhvinder
considered
running
but
then
the
of
it
her
and
she
stood
waiting
for
tessa
to
reach
her
her
with
her
stupid
plain
face
and
her
evil
son
sukhvinder
what
are
you
doing
where
are
you
going
she
could
not
even
think
of
lie
with
hopeless
gesture
of
her
shoulders
she
tessa
had
no
appointments
until
three
she
ought
to
have
taken
sukhvinder
to
the
office
and
reported
her
attempted
flight
instead
she
took
sukhvinder
upstairs
to
the
guidance
room
with
its
wall
hanging
and
the
for
sukhvinder
had
never
been
there
before
tessa
spoke
and
left
little
then
spoke
again
and
sukhvinder
sat
with
sweaty
her
gaze
fixed
on
her
shoes
tessa
knew
her
mother
tessa
would
tell
parminder
that
she
had
tried
to
but
if
she
explained
why
would
tessa
could
tessa
not
with
her
son
she
could
not
control
fats
that
was
common
knowledge
but
with
krystal
krystal
came
to
guidance
how
bad
would
the
beating
be
if
she
told
but
there
would
be
beating
even
if
she
did
not
tell
krystal
had
been
ready
to
set
her
whole
on
her
anything
happened
sukhvinder
she
nodded
tessa
said
can
you
tell
me
what
it
was
so
sukhvinder
told
she
was
sure
she
could
read
in
the
minute
of
tessa
as
she
listened
something
other
than
sympathy
for
herself
perhaps
tessa
was
thinking
about
how
parminder
might
to
the
news
that
her
treatment
of
mrs
catherine
weedon
was
being
screamed
about
in
the
street
sukhvinder
had
not
forgotten
to
worry
about
that
as
she
had
sat
in
the
bathroom
for
death
or
perhaps
tessa
look
of
unease
was
reluctance
to
krystal
weedon
doubtless
krystal
was
her
favourite
too
as
she
had
been
mr
fairbrother
sense
of
burst
through
sukhvinder
misery
her
fear
and
her
self
it
swept
aside
that
of
and
that
her
daily
she
thought
of
krystal
and
her
mates
waiting
to
charge
she
thought
of
fats
whispering
words
from
behind
her
in
every
maths
lesson
and
of
the
message
that
she
had
wiped
off
her
facebook
page
the
previous
evening
sexual
of
women
to
women
also
called
or
of
don
know
how
she
knows
said
sukhvinder
with
the
blood
in
her
ears
knows
asked
tessa
her
expression
still
troubled
that
there
been
complaint
about
mum
and
her
great
gran
krystal
and
her
mum
don
talk
to
the
rest
of
the
family
maybe
said
sukhvinder
fats
told
her
fats
tessa
repeated
you
know
because
they
re
seeing
each
other
said
sukhvinder
him
and
krystal
going
out
together
so
maybe
he
told
her
it
gave
her
some
satisfaction
to
see
every
of
professional
calm
from
tessa
face
ix
kay
bawden
never
wanted
to
set
foot
in
miles
and
samantha
house
again
she
could
not
forgive
them
for
gavin
of
indifference
nor
could
she
forget
miles
patronizing
laughter
his
attitude
to
bellchapel
or
the
way
that
he
and
samantha
had
spoken
about
krystal
weedon
in
spite
of
gavin
and
his
of
affection
kay
could
not
stop
him
nose
to
nose
with
mary
on
the
sofa
jumping
up
to
help
her
with
the
plates
walking
her
home
in
the
dark
when
gavin
told
her
few
days
later
that
he
had
had
dinner
at
mary
house
she
had
to
fight
down
an
angry
response
because
he
had
never
eaten
more
than
toast
at
her
house
in
hope
street
she
might
not
be
allowed
to
say
anything
bad
about
the
widow
about
whom
gavin
spoke
as
though
she
were
the
holy
mother
but
the
mollisons
were
different
can
say
like
miles
very
much
he
not
exactly
my
best
mate

you
ask
me

could
make

in

drive
three
houses
along

extra
to
her
desire

opened
by
short
plain
woman
in
tie
skirt
hello
said
kay
my
name
kay
bawden
and
was
wondering
whether
could
speak
to
colin
wall
for
split
second
tessa
simply
stared
at
the
attractive
young
woman
on
the
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
the
idea
across
her
mind
that
colin
was
having
an
affair
and
that
his
lover
had
come
to
tell
her
so
oh
yes
come
in
tessa
kay
wiped
her
feet
on
the
and
followed
tessa
into
sitting
room
that
was
smaller
but
than
the
mollisons
tall
man
with
high
forehead
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
with
notebook
in
his
lap
and
pen
in
his
hand
colin
this
is
kay
bawden
said
tessa
she
like
to
speak
to
you
tessa
saw
colin
startled
and
wary
expression
and
knew
at
once
that
the
woman
was
stranger
to
him
really
she
thought
little
ashamed
what
were
you
thinking
sorry
to
in
on
you
like
this
said
kay
as
colin
stood
up
to
shake
her
hand
would
have
telephoned
but
you
re
we
re
yes
said
colin
he
over
kay
his
eyes
tiny
behind
the
of
his
glasses
please
sit
down
thank
you
it
about
the
election
said
kay
this
parish
council
election
you
re
standing
aren
you
against
miles
mollison
that
right
said
colin
he
knew
who
she
must
be
the
who
had
wanted
to
talk
to
krystal
they
had
him
down
tessa
ought
not
to
have
let
her
in
was
wondering
whether
could
help
in
any
way
said
kay
social
worker
mostly
working
in
the
fields
there
are
some
facts
and
figures
could
give
you
about
the
bellchapel
addiction
clinic
which
mollison
seems
quite
keen
on
closing
ve
been
told
that
you
re
for
the
clinic
that
you
like
to
keep
it
open
the
of
relief
and
pleasure
made
him
almost
oh
yes
said
colin
yes
would
yes
that
was
my
that
to
say
the
previous
of
the
seat
barry
fairbrother
was
certainly
opposed
to
closing
the
clinic
and
am
too
well
ve
had
conversation
with
miles
mollison
and
he
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
doesn
think
the
clinic
worth
keeping
open
frankly
think
he
rather
ignorant
and
naive
about
the
and
treatment
of
addiction
and
about
the
very
real
difference
bellchapel
is
making
if
the
parish
to
the
lease
on
the
building
and
the
district
cuts
then
there
danger
that
some
very
vulnerable
people
will
be
left
without
support
yes
yes
see
said
colin
oh
yes
agree
he
was
and
that
this
attractive
young
woman
would
have
walked
through
the
evening
to
find
him
and
offer
herself
as
an
would
you
like
cup
of
tea
or
coffee
kay
asked
tessa
oh
thanks
very
much
said
kay
tea
please
tessa
no
sugar
fats
was
in
the
kitchen
helping
himself
from
the
fridge
he
ate
and
but
remained
never
putting
on
an
of
weight
in
spite
of
his
openly
disgust
for
them
he
seemed
by
tessa
pack
of
ready
filled
which
sat
in
white
box
next
to
the
tessa
moved
to
the
kettle
and
her
thoughts
returned
to
the
subject
that
had
her
ever
since
sukhvinder
had
suggested
it
earlier
that
fats
and
krystal
were
seeing
each
other
she
had
not
questioned
fats
and
she
had
not
told
colin
the
more
that
tessa
thought
about
it
the
more
certain
she
was
that
it
could
not
be
true
she
was
sure
that
fats
held
himself
in
such
high
that
no
girl
would
be
good
enough
especially
girl
like
krystal
surely
he
would
not
himself
is
that
it
is
that
what
you
think
who
here
fats
asked
tessa
through
mouthful
of
cold
as
she
put
on
the
kettle
woman
who
wants
to
help
dad
get
to
the
council
replied
tessa
in
the
cupboard
for
biscuits
why
does
she
fancy
him
grow
up
stu
said
tessa
he
several
of
thin
ham
out
of
an
open
pack
and
them
bit
by
bit
into
his
crammed
mouth
like
into
his
fist
fats
sometimes
stood
for
ten
minutes
at
time
at
the
open
fridge
open
and
and
putting
of
food
directly
into
his
mouth
it
was
habit
colin
along
with
almost
every
other
of
fats
behaviour
why
she
want
to
help
him
seriously
he
asked
having
swallowed
his
mouthful
of
meat
she
wants
the
bellchapel
addiction
clinic
to
stay
open
what
is
she
no
she
isn
said
tessa
with
that
fats
had
finished
the
last
three
chocolate
biscuits
and
left
the
empty
on
the
shelf
she
social
worker
and
she
thinks
the
clinic
is
doing
good
job
dad
wants
to
keep
it
open
but
miles
mollison
doesn
think
it
very
it
can
be
doing
that
well
the
fields
are
full
of
and
tessa
knew
that
if
she
had
said
that
colin
wanted
to
close
the
clinic
fats
would
have
instantly
produced
an
argument
for
its
you
ought
to
be
stu
she
said
as
the
kettle
lid
started
to
when
tessa
returned
to
the
sitting
room
with
her
tray
she
found
kay
talking
colin
through
of
printed
material
she
had
brought
out
of
her
big
bag
two
drugs
workers
part
by
the
council
and
partly
by
action
on
addiction
which
is
really
good
charity
then
there
social
worker
to
the
clinic
she
the
one
who
gave
me
all
this
oh
thanks
very
much
said
kay
beaming
up
at
tessa
who
had
set
down
mug
of
tea
on
the
table
beside
her
kay
had
taken
to
the
walls
in
just
few
minutes
as
she
had
not
taken
to
anybody
else
in
pagford
there
had
been
no
sweeping
up
and
down
glance
from
tessa
as
she
walked
in
no
eyed
assessment
of
her
physical
and
dress
sense
her
husband
though
nervous
seemed
decent
and
in
his
determination
to
the
of
the
fields
is
that
london
accent
kay
asked
tessa
plain
biscuit
in
her
tea
kay
nodded
what
you
to
pagford
relationship
said
kay
she
took
no
pleasure
saying
it
even
though
she
and
gavin
were
she
turned
back
to
colin
don
quite
understand
the
situation
with
to
the
parish
council
and
the
clinic
oh
it
owns
the
building
said
colin
it
an
old
church
the
lease
is
coming
up
for
so
that
would
be
an
easy
way
to
force
them
out
exactly
when
did
you
say
you
spoken
to
miles
mollison
asked
colin
both
hoping
and
to
hear
that
miles
had
mentioned
him
we
had
dinner
friday
before
last
kay
explained
gavin
and
oh
you
re
gavin
tessa
yes
and
anyway
the
subject
of
the
fields
came
up
it
would
said
tessa
and
miles
mentioned
bellchapel
and
was
quite
quite
by
the
way
he
talked
about
the
issues
involved
told
him
dealing
with
family
at
the
moment
kay
remembered
her
mention
of
the
weedons
names
and
proceeded
carefully
and
if
the
mother
is
of
methadone
she
ll
almost
certainly
end
up
back
on
the
game
that
sounds
like
the
weedons
said
tessa
with
lowering
sensation
yes
am
talking
about
the
weedons
actually
said
kay
tessa
reached
for
another
biscuit
krystal

second
time

through

kay

since
she
was

in
our

had
an
awful
life

she
as
sweet
as

is
actually
oh
agree
said
colin
remembering
colin
absolute
to
krystal
after
the
incident
in
assembly
tessa
raised
her
eyebrows
then
she
wondered
with
sick
in
her
stomach
what
colin
would
say
if
sukhvinder
was
not
lying
or
mistaken
but
surely
sukhvinder
was
wrong
she
was
naive
girl
probably
she
had
got
the
wrong
end
of
the
stick
something
the
point
is
about
the
only
thing
that
terri
is
the
fear
of
losing
her
kids
said
kay
she
back
on
at
the
moment
her
key
worker
at
the
clinic
told
me
she
bit
of
in
terri
attitude
if
bellchapel
it
all
goes
belly
up
again
and
god
knows
what
ll
happen
to
the
family
this
is
all
very
useful
said
colin
and
starting
to
make
notes
on
clean
page
in
his
notebook
very
useful
indeed
did
you
say
you
ve
got
on
people
going
clean
kay
the
printed
pages
looking
for
the
information
tessa
had
the
impression
that
colin
wanted
to
kay
attention
for
himself
he
had
always
been
to
good
looks
and
sympathetic
tessa
another
biscuit
still
thinking
about
krystal
their
recent
guidance
sessions
had
not
been
very
krystal
had
been
today
had
been
no
different
she
had
promise
from
krystal
that
she
would
not
or
sukhvinder
jawanda
again
but
krystal
demeanour
suggested
that
tessa
had
let
her
down
that
trust
was
broken
possibly
colin
was
to
blame
tessa
had
thought
that
she
and
krystal
had
strong
enough
to
that
although
it
had
never
been
quite
like
the
one
krystal
had
with
barry
tessa
had
been
there
on
the
spot
the
day
that
barry
had
come
into
school
with
rowing
machine
looking
for
to
the
he
was
trying
to
start
she
had
been
summoned
from
the
staff
room
to
the
because
the
teacher
was
off
sick
and
the
only
supply
teacher
they
could
find
at
such
short
notice
was
male
the
fourth
year
girls
in
their
and
had
been
when
they
had
arrived
in
the
to
find
miss
absent
replaced
by
two
strange
men
tessa
had
had
to
krystal
nikki
and
leanne
who
had
pushed
to
the
front
of
the
class
and
were
making
about
the
supply
teacher
he
was
handsome
young
man
with
an
unfortunate
tendency
to
barry
short
haired
and
bearded
was
wearing
tracksuit
he
had
taken
morning
off
work
to
do
this
everybody
thought
his
idea
was
strange
and
schools
like
winterdown
did
not
have
rowing
niamh
and
siobhan
had
seemed
half
amused
half
by
their
dad
presence
barry
explained
what
he
was
trying
to
do
put
together
he
had
secured
the
use
of
the
old
down
on
the
canal
at
yarvil
it
was
and
an
opportunity
to
for
themselves
for
their
school
tessa
had
herself
right
next
to
krystal
and
her
friends
to
keep
them
in
check
the
worst
of
their
giggling
had
subsided
but
was
not
entirely
barry
the
rowing
machine
and
asked
for
nobody
stepped
forward
krystal
weedon
said
barry
pointing
at
her
ve
seen
you
dangling
off
the
bars
down
the
park
that
proper
upper
body
strength
you
ve
got
there
come
here
and
give
it
go
krystal
was
only
too
happy
to
step
into
the
she
up
to
the
machine
and
sat
down
on
it
even
with
tessa
beside
them
nikki
and
leanne
had
with
laughter
and
the
rest
of
the
class
joined
in
barry
showed
krystal
what
to
do
the
silent
supply
teacher
had
watched
in
professional
alarm
as
barry
her
hands
on
the
wooden
handle
she
heaved
on
the
handle
making
stupid
face
at
nikki
and
leanne
and
everyone
laughed
again
look
at
that
barry
had
said
beaming
she
natural
had
krystal
really
been
natural
tessa
did
not
know
anything
about
rowing
she
could
not
tell
your
back
barry
told
krystal
or
you
ll
it
that
it
pull
pull
look
at
that
have
you
done
this
before
then
krystal
really
had
straightened
her
back
and
she
really
had
done
it
properly
she
stopped
looking
at
nikki
and
leanne
she
hit
excellent
said
barry
look
at
that
excellent
that
how
you
do
it
girl
and
again
and
again
and
it
shouted
krystal
know
it
does
that
how
you
end
up
with
arms
like
doing
that
said
barry
there
had
been
little
of
laughter
but
this
time
they
laughed
with
him
what
was
it
that
barry
had
had
he
was
always
so
present
so
natural
so
entirely
without
self
consciousness
teenagers
tessa
knew
were
with
the
fear
of
those
who
were
without
it
and
god
knew
there
were
few
enough
of
them
in
the
adult
world
had
natural
authority
among
the
young
they
ought
to
be
forced
to
teach
and
rest
barry
said
and
krystal
slumped
red
in
the
face
and
her
arms
you
ll
have
to
give
up
the
fags
krystal
said
barry
and
he
got
big
laugh
this
time
ok
who
else
wants
try
when
krystal
her
watching
she
was
no
longer
laughing
she
watched
each
new
her
eyes
constantly
to
barry
bearded
face
to
see
what
he
thought
of
them
when
it
up
completely
barry
said
show
em
krystal
and
her
face
lit
up
as
she
returned
to
the
machine
but
at
the
end
of
the
when
barry
asked
those
who
were
interested
in
trying
out
for
the
team
to
raise
their
hands
krystal
kept
her
arms
folded
tessa
watched
her
shake
her
head
as
nikki
muttered
to
her
barry
carefully
down
the
names
of
the
interested
girls
then
looked
up
and
you
krystal
weedon
he
said
pointing
at
her
you
re
coming
too
don
you
shake
your
head
at
me
ll
be
very
annoyed
if
don
see
you
that
natural
talent
you
ve
got
there
don
like
seeing
natural
talent
wasted
krys
he
said
loudly
her
name
don
had
krystal
thought
about
her
natural
talent
as
she
showered
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
had
she
carried
the
thought
of
her
new
around
with
her
that
day
like
an
unexpected
tessa
did
not
know
but
to
the
of
all
except
perhaps
barry
krystal
had
turned
up
at
try
colin
was
vigorously
as
kay
took
him
through
at
bellchapel
parminder
should
see
this
he
said
ll
make
sure
she
gets
copy
yes
yes
very
useful
indeed
feeling
slightly
sick
tessa
took
fourth
biscuit
parminder
worked
late
on
monday
evenings
and
as
vikram
was
usually
at
the
hospital
the
three
jawanda
children
laid
the
table
and
cooked
for
themselves
sometimes
they
occasionally
they
had
laugh
but
today
each
was
absorbed
in
their
own
particular
thoughts
and
the
job
was
completed
with
unusual
in
near
silence
sukhvinder
had
not
told
her
brother
or
her
sister
that
she
had
tried
to
or
about
krystal
weedon
threat
to
beat
her
up
the
habit
of
secrecy
was
very
strong
in
her
these
days
she
was
frightened
of
because
she
feared
that
they
might
the
world
of
that
lived
inside
her
the
world
that
fats
wall
seemed
able
to
with
such
terrifying
ease
all
the
same
she
knew
that
the
events
of
the
day
could
not
be
kept
quiet
tessa
had
told
her
that
she
intended
to
telephone
parminder
going
to
have
to
call
your
mum
sukhvinder
it
what
we
always
do
but
going
to
explain
to
her
why
you
did
it
sukhvinder
had
felt
almost
warm
towards
tessa
even
though
she
was
fats
wall
mother
frightened
though
she
was
of
her
mother
reaction
tiny
little
glow
of
hope
had
inside
her
at
the
thought
of
tessa
for
her
would
the
of
sukhvinder
desperation
lead
at
last
to
some
crack
in
her
mother
her
disappointment
her
endless
stone
faced
criticism
when
the
front
door
opened
at
last
she
heard
her
mother
speaking
oh
not
the
bloody
again
jaswant
who
had
an
ear
to
the
door
the
jawandas
owned
patch
of
land
in
the
which
parminder
the
oldest
had
inherited
from
their
father
in
the
absence
of
sons
the
occupied
place
in
the
family
consciousness
that
jaswant
and
sukhvinder
had
sometimes
discussed
to
their
slightly
amused
few
of
their
older
relatives
seemed
to
live
in
the
expectation
that
the
whole
family
would
move
back
there
one
day
parminder
father
had
sent
money
