told
the
girls
to
leave
the
and
go
to
bed
then
she
returned
to
the
sitting
room
where
she
was
three
of
the
way
down
the
bottle
of
wine
she
had
not
turned
on
the
lamps
she
pressed
play
and
kept
drinking
when
the
finished
she
put
it
back
to
the
beginning
and
watched
the
bit
she
had
missed
one
of
the
boys
appeared
more
than
the
other
three
he
was
across
the
shoulders
beneath
the
short
sleeves
of
his
shirt
he
had
thick
strong
neck
and
square
jaw
samantha
watched
him
staring
into
the
camera
with
detached
serious
expression
on
his
handsome
face
which
was
all
and
angles
and
black
eyebrows
she
thought
of
sex
with
miles
it
had
last
happened
three
weeks
previously
his
was
as
as
one
of
his
favourite
was
if
it
not
broke
don
it
samantha
the
last
of
the
bottle
into
her
glass
and
imagined
making
love
to
the
boy
on
the
screen
her
breasts
looked
better
in
bra
these
days
they
everywhere
when
she
lay
down
it
made
her
feel
and
awful
she
herself
forced
back
against
wall
one
leg
propped
up
dress
pushed
up
to
her
waist
and
that
strong
dark
boy
with
his
jeans
round
his
knees
in
and
out
of
her
with
in
the
of
her
stomach
that
was
almost
like
happiness
she
heard
the
car
turning
back
into
the
drive
and
the
of
the
swung
around
the
dark
sitting
room
she
fumbled
with
the
to
turn
over
to
the
news
which
took
her
much
longer
than
it
ought
to
have
done
she
shoved
the
empty
wine
bottle
under
the
sofa
and
clutched
her
almost
empty
glass
as
the
front
door
opened
and
closed
miles
entered
the
room
behind
her
why
are
you
sitting
here
in
the
dark
he
turned
on
lamp
and
she
glanced
up
at
him
he
was
as
well
as
he
had
been
when
he
left
except
for
the
on
the
shoulders
of
his
jacket
how
was
dinner
fine
he
said
you
were
missed
aubrey
and
julia
were
sorry
you
couldn
make
it
oh
sure
and
ll
bet
your
mother
cried
with
disappointment
he
sat
down
in
an
armchair
at
right
angles
to
her
staring
at
her
she
pushed
her
hair
out
of
her
eyes
what
this
all
about
sam
if
you
don
know
miles
but
she
was
not
sure
herself
or
at
least
she
did
not
know
how
to
this
sense
of
ill
into
can
see
how
me
standing
for
the
parish
council
oh
for
god
sake
miles
she
shouted
and
was
then
slightly
taken
aback
by
how
loud
her
voice
was
explain
to
me
please
he
said
what
possible
difference
it
can
make
to
you
she
glared
at
him
struggling
to
it
for
his
legal
mind
which
was
like
fiddling
pair
of
in
the
way
that
it
seized
on
poor
choices
of
word
yet
so
often
failed
to
grasp
the
bigger
picture
what
could
she
say
that
he
would
understand
that
she
found
howard
and
shirley
endless
talk
about
the
council
boring
as
hell
that
he
was
quite
tedious
enough
already
with
his
about
the
good
old
days
back
at
the
club
and
his
self
stories
about
work
without
adding
about
the
fields
well
was
under
the
impression
said
samantha
in
their
lit
sitting
room
that
we
had
other
plans
like
what
said
miles
what
are
you
talking
about
we
said
samantha
carefully
over
the
of
her
trembling
glass
that
once
the
girls
were
out
of
school
we
go
travelling
we
promised
each
other
that
remember
the
rage
and
misery
that
had
her
since
miles
announced
his
intention
to
stand
for
the
council
had
not
once
led
her
to
the
year
travelling
she
had
missed
but
at
this
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
that
was
the
real
problem
or
at
least
that
it
came
closest
to
both
the
and
the
yearning
inside
her
miles
seemed
completely
what
are
you
talking
about
when
got
pregnant
with
lexie
samantha
said
loudly
and
we
couldn
go
travelling
and
your
bloody
mother
made
us
get
married
in
double
quick
time
and
your
father
got
you
job
with
you
said
we
agreed
that
we
do
it
when
the
girls
were
grown
up
we
said
we
go
away
and
do
all
the
things
we
missed
out
on
he
shook
his
head
slowly
this
is
news
to
me
he
said
where
the
hell
has
this
come
from
miles
we
were
in
the
black
canon
told
you
was
pregnant
and
you
said
for
christ
sake
miles
told
you
was
pregnant
and
you
promised
me
you
promised
you
want
holiday
said
miles
is
that
it
you
want
holiday
no
miles
don
want
bloody
holiday
want
don
you
remember
we
said
we
take
year
out
and
do
it
later
when
the
kids
were
grown
up
fine
then
he
seemed
unnerved
determined
to
her
aside
fine
when
libby
eighteen
in
four
years
time
we
ll
talk
about
it
again
don
see
how
me
becoming
councillor
any
of
this
well
apart
from
the
bloody
of
listening
to
you
and
your
parents
whining
about
the
fields
for
the
rest
of
our
natural
lives
our
natural
lives
he
as
opposed
to
piss
off
she
spat
don
be
such
bloody
miles
it
might
impress
your
mother
well
frankly
still
don
see
what
the
problem
the
problem
she
shouted
is
that
this
is
about
our
future
miles
our
future
and
don
want
to
bloody
talk
about
it
in
four
years
time
want
to
talk
about
it
now
think
you
better
eat
something
said
miles
he
got
to
his
feet
you
ve
had
enough
to
drink
you
miles
sorry
if
you
re
going
to
be
he
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
room
she
barely
stopped
herself
throwing
her
wine
glass
after
him
the
council
if
he
got
on
it
he
would
never
get
off
he
would
never
his
seat
the
chance
to
be
proper
pagford
big
shot
like
howard
he
was
himself
to
pagford
his
to
the
town
of
his
birth
to
future
quite
different
from
the
one
he
had
promised
his
new
as
she
sat
sobbing
on
his
bed
when
had
they
last
talked
about
travelling
the
world
she
was
not
sure
years
and
years
ago
perhaps
but
tonight
samantha
decided
that
she
at
least
had
never
changed
her
mind
yes
she
had
always
expected
that
some
day
they
would
pack
up
and
leave
in
search
of
heat
and
freedom
half
the
away
from
pagford
shirley
mollison
and
lowe
the
rain
the
and
the
perhaps
she
had
not
thought
of
the
white
of
and
with
for
many
years
but
she
would
rather
be
there
even
with
her
heavy
and
her
stretch
marks
than
here
trapped
in
pagford
forced
to
watch
as
miles
turned
slowly
into
howard
she
slumped
back
down
on
the
sofa
for
the
and
switched
back
to
libby
the
band
now
in
black
and
white
was
walking
slowly
along
long
empty
beach
singing
the
broad
boy
shirt
was
open
in
the
breeze
fine
of
hair
led
from
his
down
into
his
jeans
the
journalist
from
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette

at
last
established
which

the
many
weedon
in

krystal

terri
suspicious
and
refused
to

she
would
be

confirm
that
she
lived
there
krystal
arrived

twenty
minutes
after
the

rows

by
her
mother
demanding

krystal
pretending
that

somehow
and
call

krystal
lowered
the
mobile

at

screen

pressed
with
her
until
she
saw
the
word

aunt

walked
back
to
nikki
and
leanne
they

nikki
checking

time

her

krystal
she
thought
of
fetching
her
mother
of
taking
her
and
robbie
to
go
and
see
nana
cath
too
but
there
had
been
huge
row
year
before
and
her
mother
and
nana
cath
had
had
no
contact
since
krystal
was
sure
that
terri
would
take
an
immense
amount
of
to
go
to
the
hospital
and
was
not
sure
that
nana
cath
would
be
happy
to
see
her
it
serious
they
re
saying
she
might
not
recover
ave
yeh
enough
cash
said
leanne
rummaging
in
her
pockets
as
the
three
of
them
walked
up
the
road
towards
the
bus
stop
yeah
said
krystal
checking
it
on
up
the
hospital
they
had
time
to
share
cigarette
before
the
number
twenty
seven
arrived
nikki
and
leanne
her
off
as
though
she
were
going
somewhere
nice
at
the
very
last
moment
krystal
felt
scared
and
wanted
to
shout
come
with
me
but
then
the
bus
pulled
away
from
the
and
nikki
and
leanne
were
already
turning
away
gossiping
the
seat
was
covered
in
some
old
the
bus
onto
the
road
that
ran
by
the
and
turned
right
into
one
of
the
main
that
led
through
all
the
big
name
shops
fear
inside
krystal
belly
like
she
had
known
that
nana
cath
was
getting
older
and
but
somehow
vaguely
she
had
expected
her
to
to
return
to
the
that
had
seemed
to
last
so
long
for
her
hair
to
turn
black
again
her
to
and
her
memory
to
like
her
tongue
she
had
never
thought
about
nana
cath
dying
always
her
with
and
if
she
had
considered
them
at
all
krystal
would
have
thought
of
the
to
nana
cath
chest
and
the
criss
her
face
as
scars
during
her
successful
to
nobody
close
to
krystal
had
ever
died
of
old
age
death
came
to
the
young
in
her
mother
circle
sometimes
even
before
their
faces
and
bodies
had
become
and
the
body
that
krystal
had
found
in
the
bathroom
when
she
was
six
had
been
of
handsome
young
man
as
white
and
lovely
as
or
that
was
how
she
remembered
him
but
sometimes
she
found
that
memory
confusing
and
doubted
it
it
was
hard
to
know
what
to
believe
she
had
often
heard
things
as
child
that
later
and
she
could
have
that
terri
had
said
it
was
yer
dad
but
then
much
later
she
had
said
don
be
so
silly
yer
dad
not
dead
in
so
krystal
had
had
to
try
and
herself
to
the
idea
of
which
was
what
everybody
called
the
man
they
said
was
her
father
but
always
in
the
background
there
had
been
nana
cath
she
had
escaped
foster
care
because
of
nana
cath
ready
and
waiting
in
pagford
strong
if
uncomfortable
safety
net
swearing
and
furious
she
had
equally
aggressive
to
terri
and
to
the
social
workers
and
taken
her
equally
angry
great
granddaughter
home
krystal
did
not
know
whether
she
had
loved
or
hated
that
little
house
in
hope
street
it
was
and
it
smelt
of
it
gave
you
in
feeling
at
the
same
time
it
was
safe
entirely
safe
nana
cath
would
only
let
in
through
the
door
there
were
old
bath
in
glass
on
the
end
of
the
bath
what
if
there
were
other
people
at
nana
cath
bedside
when
she
got
there
she
would
not
recognize
half
her
own
family
and
the
idea
that
she
might
come
across
strangers
tied
to
her
by
blood
scared
her
terri
had
several
half
sisters
of
her
father
whom
even
terri
had
never
met
but
nana
cath
tried
to
keep
up
with
them
all
contact
with
the
large
family
her
sons
had
produced
occasionally
over
the
years
relatives
krystal
did
not
recognize
had
turned
up
at
nana
cath
while
she
was
there
krystal
thought
that
they
eyed
her
and
said
things
about
her
under
their
voices
to
nana
cath
she
pretended
not
to
notice
and
waited
for
them
to
leave
so
that
she
could
have
nana
cath
to
herself
again
she
especially
disliked
the
idea
that
there
were
any
other
children
in
nana
cath
life
are
they
krystal
had
asked
nana
cath
when
she
was
nine
pointing
at
framed
photograph
of
two
boys
in
high
on
nana
cath
them
two
my
great
said
nana
cath

did
not
want

golden
hair

an
married

do
yeh
yer
whore
my
of
yeh
ve
ad
enough
terri
ve
ad
it
you
can
look
after
it
yourself
the
bus
on
through
town
past
all
the
sunday
afternoon
when
krystal
had
been
small
terri
had
taken
her
into
the
centre
of
yarvil
nearly
every
weekend
forcing
her
into
long
past
the
age
when
krystal
needed
it
because
it
was
so
much
easier
to
hide
stuff
with
push
it
down
under
the
kid
legs
hide
it
under
the
bags
in
the
under
the
seat
sometimes
terri
would
go
on
with
the
sister
she
spoke
to
cheryl
who
was
married
to
tully
cheryl
and
terri
lived
four
streets
away
from
each
other
in
the
fields
and
the
air
with
their
language
when
they
which
was
frequently
krystal
never
knew
whether
she
and
her
tully
cousins
were
supposed
to
be
on
speaking
terms
or
not
and
no
longer
bothered
keeping
but
she
spoke
to
dane
whenever
she
ran
across
him
they
had
once
after
bottle
of
out
on
the
when
they
were
fourteen
neither
of
them
had
ever
mentioned
it
afterwards
krystal
was
hazy
on
whether
or
not
it
was
legal
doing
your
cousin
something
nikki
had
said
had
made
her
think
that
maybe
it
wasn
the
bus
rolled
up
the
road
that
led
to
the
main
entrance
of
south
west
general
and
stopped
twenty
yards
from
an
enormous
long
rectangular
grey
and
glass
building
there
were
patches
of
neat
grass
few
small
trees
and
of
krystal
followed
two
old
ladies
out
of
the
bus
and
stood
with
her
hands
in
her
tracksuit
pockets
looking
around
she
had
already
forgotten
what
kind
of
had
told
her
nana
cath
was
on
she
recalled
only
the
number
twelve
she
approached
the
nearest
with
casual
air
at
it
almost
it
bore
line
upon
line
of
with
words
as
long
as
krystal
arm
and
pointing
left
right
krystal
did
not
read
well
being
with
large
of
words
made
her
feel
intimidated
and
aggressive
after
several
at
the
she
decided
that
there
were
no
numbers
there
at
all
so
she
followed
the
two
old
ladies
towards
the
double
glass
doors
at
the
front
of
the
main
building
the
was
crowded
and
more
confusing
than
the
there
was
shop
which
was
separated
from
the
main
hall
by
floor
to
ceiling
windows
there
were
rows
of
plastic
chairs
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
people
eating
sandwiches
there
was
packed
café
in
the
corner
and
kind
of
counter
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
where
women
were
answering
enquiries
as
they
checked
their
computers
krystal
headed
there
her
hands
still
in
her
pockets
where
twelve
krystal
asked
one
of
the
women
in
voice
third
floor
said
the
woman
matching
her
tone
krystal
did
not
want
to
ask
anything
else
out
of
pride
so
she
turned
and
walked
away
until
she
spotted
at
the
far
end
of
the
and
entered
one
going
up
it
took
her
nearly
fifteen
minutes
to
find
the
why
didn
they
put
up
numbers
and
not
these
stupid
long
words
but
then
walking
along
pale
green
corridor
with
her
trainers
on
the
floor
someone
called
her
name
krystal
it
was
her
aunt
cheryl
big
and
broad
in
skirt
and
tight
white
with
yellow
black

was
suddenly
frightened

did
not
like
the
smell
nana
cath
was
almost
one
side
of
her
face
was
twisted
as
though

been
pulled
with
her
mouth
dragged
to
one
side
even
her
eye
seemed
to
there

needle
in
her
arm
lying
down

chest

much
more
obvious

sheet

and
fell
in
odd
places
as
if
the
grotesque
head
on
its
neck
from
when
krystal
sat
down
beside
her
nana
cath
made
no
movement
she
simply
gazed

little
hand
slightly

cheryl
told
her
staring
over
the
of
her
can
there

not
know
whether
it
would
hurt
nana
cath
to
hold
her

edged
her

fingers
to

inches
of

she
had
been
in

with
the
idea
of
anne
who
had
been
taken
away
before
krystal
was
born
into
another
like
character
as
beautiful
and
mysterious
as
the
dead
man
in
terri
bathroom
nana
cath
lips

wha
said
krystal
bending
low
half
scared
half
yeh
wan
nana
cath

cheryl
so
loudly
that
whispering
guests
at
other
beds
stared
over
krystal
could
hear
wheezing
rattling
noise
but
nana
cath
seemed
to
be
making
attempt
to
form
word
cheryl
was
leaning
over
the
other
side
one
hand
the
metal
bars
at
the
head
of
the
bed
oh
said
nana
cath
wha
said
krystal
and
cheryl
together
the
eyes
had
moved
eyes
looking
at
krystal
smooth
young
face
her
open
mouth
as
she
leaned
over
her
great
grandmother
puzzled
and
said
the
cracked
old
voice
she
dunno
wha
she
cheryl
shouted
over
her
shoulder
at
the
couple
visiting
at
the
next
bed
three
days
on
the
fuckin
floor
not
is
it
but
tears
had
krystal
eyes
the
with
its
high
windows
dissolved
into
white
light
and
shadow
she
seemed
to
see
of
bright
sunlight
on
dark
green
water
into
by
the
rise
and
fall
of
yeah
she
whispered
to
nana
cath
yeah
goes
nana
but
it
was
no
longer
true
because
mr
fairbrother
was
dead
vi
the
fuck
have
you
done
to
your
face
come
off
the
bike
again
asked
fats
no
said
andrew
si
pie
hit
me
was
trying
to
tell
the
stupid
he
got
it
wrong
about
fairbrother
he
and
his
father
had
been
in
the
the
that
sat
on
either
side
of
the
wood
in
the
sitting
room
simon
had
hit
andrew
around
the
head
with
knocking
him
into
the
pile
of
wood
his
acne
covered
cheek
you
think
you
know
more
about
what
goes
on
than
do
you
little
shit
if
hear
you
ve
breathed
word
of
what
goes
on
in
this
house
haven
ll
fucking
skin
you
alive
you
hear
me
how
do
you
know
fairbrother
wasn
on
the
too
and
the
other
fucker
was
the
only
one
dumb
enough
to
get
caught
and
then
whether
out
of
pride
or
defiance
or
because
his
fantasies
of
easy
money
had
taken
too
strong
hold
on
his
imagination
to
become
by
facts
simon
had
sent
in
his
forms
humiliation
for
which
the
whole
family
would
surely
pay
was
andrew
on
the
word
he
wanted
to
bring
his
father
crashing
down
from
the
to
which
his
dreams
of
easy
money
had
raised
him
and
he
wanted
to
do
it
if
at
all
possible
for
he
preferred
glory
without
death
in
such
way
that
simon
would
never
know
whose
had
brought
his
to
he
confided
in
nobody
not
even
fats
he
told
fats
nearly
everything
but
the
few
were
the
the
ones
that
occupied
nearly
all
his
interior
space
it
was
one
thing
to
sit
in
fats
room
with
hard
and
look
up
girl
on
girl
action
on
the
internet
quite
another
to
how
he
ways
of
gaia
bawden
in
conversation
it
was
easy
to
sit
in
the
cubby
hole
and
call
his
father
but
never
would
he
have
told
how
simon
turned
his
hands
cold
and
his
stomach
but
then
came
the
hour
that
changed
everything
it
started
with
nothing
more
than
yearning
for
and
beauty
the
rain
had
passed
off
at
last
and
the
pale
spring
sun
shone
brightly
on
the
fish
dirt
on
the
school
bus
windows
as
it
and
through
the
narrow
streets
of
pagford
andrew
was
sitting
near
the
back
unable
to
see
gaia
who
was
in
at
the
front
by
sukhvinder
and
the
fairbrother
girls
newly
returned
to
school
he
had
barely
seen
gaia
all
day
and
faced
evening
with
only
stale
facebook
pictures
to
him
as
the
bus
approached
hope
street
it
struck
andrew
that
neither
of
his
parents
was
at
home
to
notice
his
absence
three
cigarettes
that
fats
had
given
him
in
his
inside
pocket
and
gaia
was
getting
up
holding
tightly
to
the
bar
on
the
back
of
the
seat
herself
to
still
talking
to
sukhvinder
jawanda
why
not
why
not
so
he
got
up
too
swung
his
bag
over
his
shoulder
and
when
the
bus
stopped
walked
briskly
up
the
aisle
after
the
two
girls
as
they
got
out
see
you
at
home
he
threw
out
to
startled
paul
as
he
passed
he
reached
the
pavement
and
the
bus
away
lighting
up
he
watched
gaia
and
sukhvinder
over
the
top
of
his
hands
they
were
not
heading
towards
gaia
house
in
hope
street
but
up
towards
the
square
smoking
and
scowling
slightly
in
unconscious
of
the
most
conscious
person
he
knew
fats
andrew
followed
them
his
eyes
on
gaia
copper
brown
hair
as
it
on
her
shoulder
the
swing
of
her
skirt
as
her
beneath
it
the
two
girls
slowed
down
as
they
approached
the
square
towards
mollison
and
lowe
which
had
the
most
impressive
of
them
all
blue
and
gold
across
the
front
and
four
hanging
andrew
hung
back
the
girls
paused
to
examine
small
white
sign
to
the
window
of
the
new
café
then
disappeared
into
the
delicatessen
andrew
walked
once
around
the
square
past
the
black
canon
and
the
george
hotel
and
stopped
at
the
sign
it
was
hand
advertisement
for
weekend
staff
of
his
acne
which
was
particularly
at
the
moment
he
knocked
out
the
end
of
his
cigarette
put
the
long
back
into
his
pocket
and
followed
gaia
and
sukhvinder
inside
the
girls
were
standing
beside
little
table
piled
high
with
and
watching
the
enormous
man
in
the
deerstalker
behind
the
counter
talking
to
an
elderly
gaia
looked
around
when
the
bell
over
the
door
tinkled
hi
andrew
said
his
mouth
dry
hi
she
replied
by
his
own
daring
andrew
walked
and
the
school
bag
over
his
shoulder
into
the
stand
of
to
pagford
and
west
country
he
seized
the
stand
and
it
then
hastily
lowered
his
bag

asked

quietly
in
her
london
accent

said

howard
eyes
over
the
three
teenagers
waiting
quietly
beside
the
biscuits
they
were
wearing
the
half
hearted
uniform
of
winterdown
which
permitted
so
much
and
that
it
was
barely
uniform
at
all
unlike
that
of
st
anne
which
neat
skirt
and
for
all
that
the
white
girl
was
cut
set
off
by
the
plain
jawanda

mouse
haired
boy
with
violently

forwards
about

small
sign
in
the
window

howard

she

perfect
exactly
what
he
had
been
imagining
fresh
faced
and
he
could
just
imagine
her
in
figure
black
dress
with
edged
white
apron
he
would
teach
her
to
use
the
till
and
show
her
around
the
there
would
be
bit
of
and
perhaps
little
on
days
when
the
were
up
howard
out
from
behind
the
counter
and
ignoring
sukhvinder
and
andrew
took
gaia
by
the
upper
arm
and
led
her
through
the
in
the
wall
there
were
no
tables
and
chairs
there
yet
but
the
counter
had
been
and
so

black
and
cream
on
the
wall
behind
it
which
showed
the
square
in
women
and
men
in
top
everywhere

drawn
up
outside
clearly
marked
mollison
and
lowe
and
beside
it
was
the
little
café
the
copper
kettle
the
had
an
instead
of
the
war
memorial
andrew
and
sukhvinder
were
left
behind
awkward
and
vaguely
to
each
other
yes
can
help
you
woman
with
black
had
emerged
from
out
of
back
room
andrew
and
sukhvinder
muttered
that
they
were
waiting
and
then
howard
and
gaia
reappeared
in
the
when
he
saw
maureen
howard
dropped
gaia
arm
which
he
had
been
holding
absent
mindedly
while
he
explained
to
her
what
waitress
duties
would
be
might
have
found
us
some
more
help
for
the
kettle
mo
he
said
oh
yes
said
maureen
her
hungry
gaze
to
gaia
have
you
got
experience
but
howard
boomed
over
her
telling
gaia
all
about
the
delicatessen
and
how
he
liked
to
think
it
was
bit
of
pagford
institution
bit
of
landmark
thirty
five
years
it
been
said
howard
with
of
his
own
the
young
lady
new
to
town
mo
he
added
and
you
two
are
after
jobs
as
well
are
you
maureen
asked
sukhvinder
and
andrew
sukhvinder
shook
her
head
andrew
made
an
movement
with
his
shoulders
but
gaia
said
with
her
eyes
on
the
girl
go
on
you
said
you
might
howard
considered
sukhvinder
who
would
most
certainly
not
appear
to
advantage
in
tight
black
dress
and
frilly
apron
but
his
and
mind
was
in
all
directions
compliment
to
her
father
something
of
hold
over
her
mother
an
favour
granted
there
were
matters
beyond
the
purely
that
ought
perhaps
to
be
considered
here
well
if
we
get
the
business
we
re
expecting
we
could
probably
do
with
two
he
said
scratching
his
with
his
eyes
on
sukhvinder
who
had
don
she
said
but
gaia
urged
her
go
on
together
sukhvinder
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
were
go
on
whispered
gaia
all
right
we
ll
give
you
trial
then
miss
jawanda
said
howard
in
fear
sukhvinder
could
hardly
breathe
what
would
her
mother
say
and
suppose
you
re
wanting
to
be
are
you
howard
boomed
at
andrew
it
heavy
we
need
my
friend
said
howard
while
andrew
at
him
he
had
only
read
the
large
type
at
the
top
of
the
sign
into
the
of
milk
up
from
the
and
rubbish
up
at
the
back
proper
do

said
andrew
would
he
be
there
when
gaia
was
there
that
was
all
that
mattered
we

need

clock

till

and

period
of

weeks
yeah
fine
said
andrew
what
your
name
when
howard
heard
it
he
raised
his
eyebrows
is
your
father
simon
simon
price
yeah
andrew
was
unnerved
nobody
knew
who
his
father
was
usually
howard
told
the
two
girls
to
come
back
on
sunday
afternoon
when
the
till
was
to
be
and
he
would
be
at
to
them
then
though
he
showed
an
to
keep
gaia
in
conversation
entered
and
the
teenagers
took
their
chance
to
slip
outside
andrew
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
once
they
found
themselves
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
door
but
before
he
could
his
thoughts
gaia
threw
him
careless
and
walked
away
with
sukhvinder
andrew
lit
up
the
second
of
fats
three
fags
this
was
no
time
for
half
smoked
which
gave
him
an
excuse
to
remain
while
he
watched
her
walk
away
into
the
shadows
why
do
they
call
him
peanut
that
boy
gaia
asked
sukhvinder
once
they
were
out
of
of
andrew
he
said
sukhvinder
she
was
horrified
at
the
prospect
of
telling
parminder
what
she
had
done
her
voice
sounded
like
somebody
else
he
nearly
died
at
st
thomas
somebody
gave
him
one
hidden
in
oh
said
gaia
thought
it
might
be
because
he
had
tiny
she
laughed
and
so
did
sukhvinder
forcing
herself
as
though
jokes
about
were
all
she
heard
day
in
day
out
andrew
saw
them
both
glance
back
at
him
as
they
laughed
and
knew
that
they
were
talking
about
him
the
giggling
might
be
hopeful
sign
he
knew
that
much
about
girls
anyway
grinning
at
nothing
but
the
air
he
walked
off
school
bag
over
his
shoulder
cigarette
in
his
hand
across
the
square
towards
church
row
and
to
forty
minutes
of
steep
up
out
of
town
to
hilltop
house
the
were
pale
with
white
in
the
on
either
side
of
him
the
lane
with
tiny
glossy
heart
shaped
leaves
the
smell
of
the
flowers
the
deep
pleasure
of
the
cigarette
and
the
promise
of
weekends
with
gaia
everything
together
into
glorious
of
and
beauty
as
andrew
up
the
hill
the
next
time
simon
said
got
job
pizza
face
he
would
be
able
to
say
yes
he
was
going
to
be
gaia
bawden
weekend
and
to
cap
it
all
he
knew
at
last
exactly
how
he
might
an
anonymous
straight
between
his
father
shoulder
vii
once
the
first
impulse
of
spite
had
worn
off
samantha
bitterly
regretted
gavin
and
kay
to
dinner
she
spent
friday
morning
joking
with
her
assistant
about
the
dreadful
evening
she
was
bound
to
have
but
her
mood
once
she
had
left
in
charge
of
over
the
shoulder
name
that
had
made
howard
laugh
so
hard
the
first
time
he
had
heard
it
that
it
had
brought
on
an
attack
and
which
made
shirley
whenever
it
was
spoken
in
her
presence
driving
back
to
pagford
ahead
of
the
rush
hour
so
that
she
could
shop
for
and
start
samantha
tried
to
herself
up
by
thinking
of
nasty
questions
to
ask
gavin
perhaps
she
might
wonder
aloud
why
kay
had
not
moved
in
with
him
that
would
be
good
one
walking
home
from
the
square
with
bulging
mollison
and
lowe
carrier
bags
in
each
hand
she
came
across
mary
fairbrother
beside
the
cash
point
machine
in
the
wall
of
barry
bank
mary
hi
how
are
you
mary
was
thin
and
pale
with
grey
patches
around
her
eyes
their
conversation
was
and
strange
they
had
not
spoken
since
the
journey
in
the
ambulance
brief
awkward
at
the
funeral
ve
been
meaning
to
drop
in
mary
said
you
were
so
kind
and
wanted
to
thank
miles
no
need
samantha
said
oh
but
like
oh
but
then
please
do
after
mary
had
walked
away
samantha
had
the
awful
feeling
that
she
might
have
given
the
impression
that
that
evening
would
be
perfect
time
for
mary
to
come
round
once
home
she
dropped
the
bags
in
the
hall
and
telephoned
miles
at
work
to
tell
him
what
she
had
done
but
he
an
about
the
prospect
of
adding
newly
woman
to
their
can
see
what
the
problem
is
really
he
said
nice
for
mary
to
get
out
but
didn
say
we
were
having
gavin
and
kay
over
mary
likes
gav
said
miles
wouldn
worry
about
it
he
was
samantha
thought
being
deliberately
no
doubt
in
for
her
to
go
to
sweetlove
house
after
she
had
hung
up
she
wondered
whether
to
call
mary
to
tell
her
not
to
come
that
evening
but
she
was
afraid
of
rude
and
settled
for
hoping
that
mary
would
find
herself
to
calling
in
after
all
into
the
sitting
room
she
put
on
libby
boy
band
at
full
so
that
she
would
be
able
to
hear
it
in
the
kitchen
then
carried
the
bags
through
and
set
to
work
preparing
and
her
fall
back
pudding
pie
she
would
have
liked
to
buy
one
of
mollison
and
lowe
large
to
save
herself
some
work
but
it
would
have
got
straight
back
to
shirley
who
frequently
that
samantha
was
over
on
food
and
ready
meals
samantha
knew
the
boy
band
so
well
by
now
that
she
was
able
to
the
images
matching
the
music
through
to
the
kitchen
several
times
that
week
while
miles
was
upstairs
in
his
home
study
or
on
the
telephone
to
howard
she
had
watched
it
again
when
she
heard
the
opening
bars
of
the
where
the
boy
walked
with
his
shirt
open
along
the
beach
she
went
through
to
watch
in
her
apron
absent
mindedly
her
fingers
she
had
planned
on
having
long
shower
while
miles
laid
the
table
forgetting
that
he
would
be
late
home
because
he
had
to
drive
into
yarvil
to
pick
up
the
girls
from
st
anne
when
samantha
realized
why
he
had
not
returned
and
that
their
daughters
would
be
with
him
when
he
did
she
had
to
fly
around
to
the
dining
room
herself
then
find
something
to
feed
lexie
and
libby
before
the
guests
arrived
miles
found
his
wife
in
her
work
clothes
at
half
past
seven
sweaty
cross
and
inclined
to
blame
him
for
what
had
been
her
own
idea
fourteen
year
old
libby
marched
into
the
sitting
room
without
greeting
samantha
and
removed
the
from
the
player
oh
good
was
wondering
what
done
with
that
she
said
why
the
tv
on
have
you
been
playing
it
sometimes
samantha
thought
that
her
younger
daughter
had
look
of
shirley
about
her
was
watching
the
news
libby
haven
got
time
to
watch
come

your
pizza
ready
we
ve
got
people
coming
round
pizza
again
miles
need
to
change
can
you
the
potatoes
for
me
miles
but
he
had
disappeared
upstairs
so
samantha
pounded
the
potatoes
herself
while
her
daughters
ate
at
the
island
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
libby
had
propped
the
cover
against
her
glass
of
and
was
it
so
she
said
with
groan
that
took
samantha
aback
but
the
boy
was
called
samantha
was
glad
they
did
not
like
the
same
one
loud
and
confident
lexie
was
about
school
machine
of
information
about
girls
whom
samantha
did
not
know
with
whose
and
and
she
could
not
keep
up
all
right
you
two
ve
got
to
change
clear
away
when
you
re
done
all
right
she
turned
down
the
heat
under
the
and
hurried
upstairs
miles
was
up
his
shirt
in
the
bedroom
watching
himself
in
the
wardrobe
mirror
the
whole
room
smelt
of
soap
and
everything
under
control
yes
thanks
so
glad
you
ve
had
time
to
shower
spat
samantha
pulling
out
her
favourite
long
skirt
and
top
slamming
the
wardrobe
door
you
could
have
one
now
they
ll
be
here
in
ten
minutes
won
have
time
to
dry
my
hair
and
put
on
make
up
she
kicked
off
her
shoes
one
of
them
hit
the
with
loud
when
you
ve
finished
could
you
please
go
downstairs
and
sort
out
drinks
after
miles
had
left
the
room
she
tried
to
her
thick
hair
and
her
make
up
she
looked
awful
only
when
she
had
changed
did
she
realize
that
she
was
wearing
the
wrong
bra
for
her
clinging
top
after
search
she
remembered
that
the
right
one
was
in
the
room
she
hurried
out
onto
the
landing
but
the
doorbell
rang
swearing
she
back
to
the
bedroom
the
boy
band
music
was
out
of
libby
room
gavin
and
kay
had
arrived
on
the
of
eight
because
gavin
was
afraid
of
what
samantha
might
say
if
they
turned
up
late
he
could
imagine
her
suggesting
that
they
had
lost
of
time
because
they
were
shagging
or
that
they
must
have
had
row
she
seemed
to
think
that
one
of
the
of
marriage
was
that
it
gave
you
of
comment
and
over
single
people
love
lives
she
also
thought
that
her
way
of
talking
especially
when
drunk
constituted
humour
hello
said
miles
moving
back
to
let
gavin
and
kay
inside
come
in
come
in
welcome
to
mollison
he
kissed
kay
on
both
cheeks
and
relieved
her
of
the
she
was
holding
for
us
thanks
very
much
lovely
to
meet
you
properly
at
last
gav
been
keeping
you
under
for
far
too
long
miles
shook
the
wine
out
of
gavin
hand
then
clapped
him
on
the
back
which
gavin
come
on
through
sam
ll
be
down
in
mo
what
ll
you
have
to
drink
kay
would
have
found
miles
rather
smooth
and
over
familiar
but
she
was
determined
to
judgement
had
to
with
each
other
and
manage
to
get
along
in
them
this
evening
represented
progress
in
her
to
the
of
his
life
to
which
gavin
had
never
admitted
her
and
she
wanted
to
show
him
that
she
was
at
home
in
the
mollisons
big
house
that
there
was
no
need
to
her
any
more
so
she
smiled
at
miles
asked
for
red
wine
and
admired
the
room
with
its
stripped
pine
its
over
sofa
and
its
framed
prints
been
here
for
getting
on
for
fourteen
years
said
miles
busy
with
the
you
re
down
in
hope
street
aren
you
nice
little
houses
some
great
upper
down
there
samantha
appeared
smiling
without
warmth
kay
who
had
previously
seen
her
only
in
an
overcoat
the
of
her
top
beneath
which
every
detail
of
her
bra
was
clearly
visible
her
face
was
even
darker
than
her
chest
her
eye
make
up
was
thick
and
and
her
gold
and
high
golden
were
in
kay
opinion
samantha
struck
her
as
the
kind
of
woman
who
would
have
girls
nights
out
and
find
and
with
everyone
else
partner
at
parties
hi
there
said
samantha
she
kissed
gavin
and
smiled
at
kay
great
you
ve
got
drinks
ll
have
the
same
as
kay
miles
she
turned
away
to
sit
down
having
already
taken
stock
of
the
other
woman
appearance
kay
was
small
and
heavy
and
had
certainly
chosen
her
black
trousers
to
the
size
of
her
bottom
she
would
have
done
better
in
samantha
opinion
to
wear
heels
given
the
of
her
legs
her
face
was
attractive
enough
with
even
skin
large
dark
eyes
and
mouth
but
the
closely
cropped
boy
hair
and
the
flat
shoes
were
undoubtedly
to
certain
gavin
had
done
it
again
he
had
gone
and
picked
another
woman
who
would
make
his
life
misery
so
said
samantha
brightly
raising
her
glass
gavin
and
kay
she
saw
with
satisfaction
gavin
of
smile
but
before
she
could
make
him
more
or
private
information
out
of
them
both
to
over
shirley
and
maureen
heads
the
doorbell
rang
again
mary
appeared
fragile
and
especially
beside
miles
who
her
into
the
room
her
shirt
hung
from
oh
she
said
coming
to
startled
on
the
threshold
didn
realize
you
were
having
gavin
and
kay
just

said
samantha
little
come
in
mary
please

drink
mary

is
kay
said
miles
kay
this
is
mary
fairbrother
oh
said
kay
thrown
she
had
thought
that
it
would
only
be
the
four
of
them
yes
hello
gavin
who
could
tell
that
mary
had
not
meant
to
drop
in
on
dinner
party
and
was
on
the
point
of
walking
straight
back
out
again
patted
the
sofa
beside
him
mary
sat
down
with
weak
smile
he
was
to
see
her
here
was
his
even
samantha
must
realize
that
her
particular
brand
of
would
be
inappropriate
in
front
of
woman
the
of
had
been
broken
up
how
are
you
he
said
quietly
was
going
to
give
you
ring
actually
there
ve
been
with
the
insurance
haven
we
got
any
sam
asked
miles
samantha
walked
from
the
room
at
miles
the
smell
of
meat
met
her
as
she
opened
the
kitchen
door
oh
shit
shit
shit
she
had
completely
forgotten
the
which
had
dried
out
of
meat
and
vegetables
sat
of
the
on
the
bottom
of
the
pot
samantha
in
wine
and
stock
the
bits
off
the
with
her
spoon
vigorously
sweating
in
the
heat
miles
high
pitched
laugh
rang
out
from
the
sitting
room
samantha
put
on
long
to
drained
her
glass
of
wine
ripped
open
bag
of
chips
and
of
and
them
into
mary
and
gavin
were
still
quietly
on
the
sofa
when
she
returned
to
the
sitting
room
while
miles
was
showing
kay
framed
photograph
of
pagford
and
giving
her
lesson
in
the
town
history
samantha
set
down
the
on
the
coffee
table
poured
herself
another
drink
and
settled
into
the
armchair
making
no
effort
to
join
either
conversation
it
was
uncomfortable
to
have
mary
there
with
her
grief
hanging
so
heavily
around
her
she
might
as
well
have
walked
in
surely
though
she
would
leave
before
dinner
gavin
was
determined
that
mary
should
stay
as
they
discussed
the
in
their
with
the
insurance
company
he
felt
much
more
and
in
control
than
he
usually
did
in
miles
and
samantha
presence
nobody
was
away
at
him
or
patronizing
him
and
miles
was
him
temporarily
of
all
responsibility
for
kay
and
just
here
just
out
of
sight
miles
was
saying
pointing
to
spot
two
inches
past
the
frame
of
the
picture
you

got
sweetlove
house
the
fawley
place
big
queen
anne
manor
house
stone
you
should
visit
it
open
to
the
public
on
in
the
summer
important
family
the
fawleys
stone
important
family
god
you
are
an
miles
samantha
herself
out
of
her
armchair
and
returned
to
the
kitchen
though
the
was
the
burnt
dominated
the
was
and
the
cool
and
dry
past
caring
she
it
all
into
and
slammed
it
down
on
the
dining
room
table
dinner
ready
she
called
at
the
sitting
room
door
oh
must
go
said
mary
jumping
up
didn
mean
no
no
no
said
gavin
in
tone
that
kay
had
never
heard
before
kindly
and
it
ll
do
you
good
to
eat
kids
ll
be
all
right
for
an
hour
miles
added
his
support
and
mary
looked
towards
samantha
who
was
forced
to
add
her
voice
to
theirs
then
back
through
into
the
dining
room
to
lay
another
setting
she
invited
mary
to
sit
between
gavin
and
miles
because
placing
her
next
to
woman
seemed
to
her
husband
absence
kay
and
miles
had
moved
on
to
discussing
social
work
don
you
he
said
kay
large
full
of
samantha
could
see
black
in
the
spreading
across
the
white
plate
bloody
difficult
job
well
we
re
perennially
under
said
kay
but
it
can
be
especially
when
you
can
feel
you
re
making
difference
and
she
thought
of
the
weedons
terri
had
tested
at
the
clinic
yesterday
and
robbie
had
had
full
week
in
nursery
the
recollection
her
her
slight
irritation
that
gavin
attention
was
still
entirely
on
mary
that
he
was
doing
nothing
to
help
ease
her
conversation
with
his
friends
you
ve
got
daughter
haven
you
kay
that
right
gaia
she
sixteen
same
age
as
lexie
we
should
get
them
together
said
miles
divorced
asked
samantha
no
said
kay
we
weren
married
he
was
university
boyfriend
and
we
split
up
not
long
after
she
was
born
yeah
miles
and
had
barely
left
university
ourselves
said
samantha
kay
did
not
know
whether
samantha
meant
to
draw
distinction
between
herself
who
had
married
the
big
father
of
her
children
and
kay
who
had
been
left
not
that
samantha
could
know
that
had
left
her
gaia
taken
saturday
job
with
your
father
actually
kay
told
miles
at
the
new
café
miles
was
delighted
he
took
enormous
pleasure
in
the
idea
that
he
and
howard
were
so
much
part
of
the
of
the
place
that
everybody
in
pagford
was
connected
to
them
whether
as
friend
or
client
or
gavin
who
was
chewing
and
chewing
on
bit
of
meat
that
was
refusing
to
to
his
teeth
experienced
further
lowering
in
the
of
his
stomach
it
was
news
to
him
that
gaia
had
taken
job
with
miles
father
somehow
he
had
forgotten
that
kay
possessed
in
gaia
another
powerful
for
herself
to
pagford
when
not
in
the
immediate
of
her
slamming
doors
her
vicious
looks
and
gavin
tended
to
forget
that
gaia
had
any
independent
existence
at
all
that
she
was
not
simply
part
of
the
uncomfortable
of
stale
sheets
bad
and
against
which
his
relationship
with
kay
on
does
gaia
like
pagford
samantha
asked
well
it
bit
quiet
compared
to
hackney
said
kay
but
she
settling
in
well
she
took
large
of
wine
to
wash
out
her
mouth
after
the
enormous
lie
there
had
been
yet
another
row
before
leaving
tonight
what
the
matter
with
you
kay
had
asked
while
gaia
sat
at
the
kitchen
table
over
her
laptop
wearing
dressing
gown
over
her
clothes
four
or
five
boxes
of
dialogue
were
open
on
the
screen
kay
knew
that
gaia
was
online
with
the
friends
she
had
left
behind
in
hackney
friends
she
had
had
in

of
the
conversations

the
screen
kay
both
wanting
to
press
her
and
afraid
of

though
it

awful

miles
with
smile
yes
well
the
fields
do
belong
to
pagford
they
do
painful
subject
kay
really
why
asked
kay
hoping
to
make
conversation
general
because
gavin
was
still
talking
in
an
to
the
widow
well
you
see
this
is
back
in
the
miles
seemed
to
be
on
well
speech
yarvil
wanted
to
the
cantermill
estate
and
instead
of
building
out
to
the
west
where
the
bypass
is
now
gavin
mary
more
wine
samantha
called
over
miles
they
were
little
bit
land
was
bought
without
it
being
very
clear
what
they
wanted
it
for
and
then
they
went
and
the
estate
over
the
into
pagford
parish
why
aren
you
old
aubrey
fawley
miles
asked
samantha
she
had
at
last
reached
that
delicious
point
of
where
her
tongue
became
and
she
became
from
fear
of
consequences
to
and
to
seeking
nothing
but
her
own
amusement
the
truth
is
that
old
aubrey
fawley
who
used
to
own
all
those
lovely
stone
or
whatever
miles
was
telling
you
about
did
deal
behind
everyone
backs
that
not
fair
sam
said
miles
but
she
talked
over
him
again
he
off
the
land
where
the
fields
are
built
don
know
must
have
been
quarter
of
or
so
don
talk
rubbish
sam
back
in
the
but
then
once
he
realized
everyone
was
pissed
off
with
him
he
pretended
he
hadn
known
it
would
cause
trouble
upper
class
and
drunk
added
samantha
simply
not
true
afraid
miles
said
firmly
to
fully
understand
the
problem
kay
you
need
to
bit
of
local
history
samantha
holding
her
chin
in
her
hand
pretended
to
her
elbow
off
the
table
in
though
she
could
not
like
samantha
kay
laughed
and
gavin
and
mary
broke
off
their
quiet
conversation
we
re
talking
about
the
fields
said
kay
in
tone
intended
to
remind
gavin
that
she
was
there
that
he
ought
to
be
giving
her
moral
support
miles
samantha
and
gavin
realized
that
the
fields
was
most
subject
to
raise
in
front
of
mary
when
they
had
been
such
bone
of
between
barry
and
howard
apparently
they
re
bit
of
sore
subject
said
kay
wanting
to
force
gavin
to
express
view
to
him
in
he
replied
and
turning
back
to
mary
he
said
so
how
declan
football
coming
on
kay
experienced
powerful
of
fury
mary
might
be
recently
but
gavin
seemed
unnecessarily
pointed
she
had
imagined
this
evening
quite
differently
in
which
gavin
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
they
really
were
couple
yet
nobody
looking
on
would
imagine
that
they
enjoyed
closer
relationship
than
also
the
food
was
horrible
kay
put
her
knife
and
together
with
three
of
her
helping
an
act
that
was
not
lost
on
samantha
and
addressed
miles
again
did
you
grow
up
in
pagford
afraid
so
said
miles
smiling
born
in
the
old
hospital
along
the
road
they
closed
it
in
the
and
you
kay
asked
samantha
who
cut
across
her
god
no
here
by
accident
sorry
don
know
what
you
do
samantha
asked
kay
ve
got
my
own
she
said
miles
samantha
got
up
abruptly
and
went
to
fetch
another
bottle
of
wine
when
she
returned
to
the
table
miles
was
telling
kay
the
doubtless
intended
to
how
everyone
knew
everyone
in
pagford
of
how
he
had
been
pulled
over
in
the
car
one
night
by
policeman
who
turned
out
to
be
friend
he
had
known
since
primary
school
the
blow
by
blow
re
of
the
between
himself
and
was
familiar
to
samantha
as
she
moved
around
the
table
all
the
glasses
she
watched
kay
expression
kay
did
not
find
drink
driving
laughing
matter
so
holding
out
the
and
about
to
blow
in
it
and
out
of
nowhere
we
both
start
up
his
partner
got
no
idea
what
the
hell
going
on
he
like
this
miles
man
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
and
bent
double
himself
because
all
we
can
think
of
is
the
last
time
he
was
holding
something
steady
for
me
to
blow
into
which
was
on
twenty
years
ago
and
it
was
blow
up
said
samantha
unsmiling
dropping
back
into
her
seat
beside
miles
miles
and
put
it
in
their
friend
parents
bed
during
eighteenth
birthday
party
anyway
in
the
end
miles
was
and
got
three
on
his
licence
because
it
was
the
second
time
he
been
caught
over
the
limit
so
that
was
funny
miles
grin
remained
in
place
like
forgotten
after
party
stiff
little
seemed
to
blow
through
the
temporarily
silent
room
though
miles
struck
her
as
an
bore
kay
was
on
his
side
he
was
the
only
one
at
the
