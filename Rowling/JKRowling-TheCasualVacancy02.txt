his

after
another
long
pause
terri
out
of
her
chair
and
her
way
into
the
hall
kay
leaned
forward
and
shifted
the
loose
lid
of
the
biscuit
tin
terri
had
when
she
sat
down
inside
was
bit
of
cotton
wool
looking
spoon
and
dusty
bag
kay
snapped
the
lid
back
on
firmly
while
robbie
watched
her
terri
returned
after
some
distant
carrying
cup
of
which
she
shoved
at
the
little
boy
there
she
said
more
to
kay
than
to
her
son
and
she
sat
back
down
again
she
missed
the
seat
and
with
the
arm
of
the
chair
on
her
first
attempt
kay
heard
the
bone
with
wood
but
terri
seemed
to
feel
no
pain
she
settled
herself
back
into
the
and
the
social
worker
with
indifference
kay
had
read
the
file
from
cover
to
cover
she
knew
that
nearly
everything
of
in
terri
weedon
life
had
been
sucked
into
the
black
hole
of
her
addiction
that
it
had
cost
her
two
children
that
she
barely
clung
to
two
more
that
she
herself
to
pay
for
heroin
that
she
had
been
involved
in
every
sort
of
petty
crime
and
that
she
was
for
the
time
but
not
to
feel
not
to
care
right
now
kay
thought
she
happier
than
am
iii
at
the
start
of
the
second
post
lunch
period
stuart
fats
wall
walked
out
of
school
his
in
was
in
no
rash
spirit
he
had
decided
the
previous
night
that
he
would
miss
the
double
period
of
computing
that
finished
the
afternoon
he
might
have
chosen
to
any
lesson
but
it
so
happened
that
his
best
friend
andrew
price
known
to
fats
as
arf
was
in
different
set
in
computing
and
fats
in
spite
of
his
best
efforts
had
not
succeeded
in
being
to
join
him
fats
and
andrew
were
perhaps
equally
aware
that
the
admiration
in
their
relationship
flowed
mostly
from
andrew
to
fats
but
fats
alone
suspected
that
he
needed
andrew
more
than
andrew
needed
him
lately
fats
had
started
to
this
in
the
light
of
but
he
that
while
his
liking
for
andrew
company
lingered
he
might
as
well
miss
double
period
where
he
had
to
do
without
it
anyway
fats
had
been
told
by
that
the
one
fail
safe
way
of
the
winterdown
grounds
without
being
spotted
from
window
was
to
climb
over
the
side
wall
by
the
bike
shed
this
therefore
he
did
dropping
down
by
his
into
the
narrow
lane
on
the
other
side
he
landed
without
strode
off
along
the
narrow
path
and
turned
left
onto
the
busy
dirty
main
road
safely
on
his
way
he
lit
cigarette
and
proceeded
past
the
run
down
little
shops
five
along
fats
turned
left
again
into
the
first
of
the
streets
that
made
up
the
fields
he
his
school
tie
with
one
hand
as
he
walked
but
did
not
remove
it
he
did
not
care
that
he
was
schoolboy
fats
had
never
even
attempted
to
his
uniform
in
any
way
to
on
his
or
his
tie
knot
to
suit
he
wore
his
school
clothes
with
the
of
he
had
decided
that
he
possessed
that
were
authentic
which
ought
therefore
to
be
and
but
also
that
some
of
his
of
thought
were
the
unnatural
of
his
unfortunate
and
and
to
be
lately
he
had
been
with
acting
on
what
he
thought
were
his
authentic
and
ignoring
or
the
guilt
and
fear
that
such
actions
seemed
to
undoubtedly
this
was
becoming
easier
with
practice
he
wanted
to
up
inside
to
become
to
be
free
of
the
fear
of
consequences
to
rid
himself
of
of
and
one
of
the
things
that
had
begun
to
him
about
his
own
on
andrew
was
that
the
presence
sometimes
and
limited
the
full
expression
of
fats
authentic
self
somewhere
in
andrew
was
self
drawn
of
what
constituted
fair
play
and
lately
fats
had
caught
looks
of
confusion
and
disappointment
poorly
disguised
on
his
old
friend
face
andrew
pulled
up
short
at
of
and
fats
did
not
hold
this
against
andrew
it
would
have
been
for
andrew
to
join
in
unless
that
was
what
he
really
truly
wanted
the
trouble
was
that
andrew
was
an
to
the
kind
of
against
which
fats
was
an
increasingly
determined
war
fats
suspected
that
the
right
thing
to
do
the
act
in
of
full
would
have
been
to
cut
andrew
and
yet
he
still
preferred
andrew
company
to
anybody
else
fats
was
convinced
that
he
knew
himself
particularly
well
he
the
and
of
his
own
with
an
attention
he
had
recently
ceased
to
give
to
anything
else
he
spent
hours
himself
about
his
own
and
fears
to
between
those
that
were
truly
his
and
those
that
he
had
been
taught
to
feel
he
examined
his
own
nobody
else
he
knew
he
was
sure
was
ever
this
honest
with
themselves
they
drifted
half
asleep
through
life
and
his
conclusion
had
been
that
andrew
whom
he
had
known
since
he
was
five
was
the
person
for
whom
he
felt
the
most
affection
that
even
though
he
was
now
old
enough
to
see
through
her
he
retained
an
to
his
mother
that
was
not
his
own
fault
and
that
he
despised
cubby
who
represented
the
and
of
on
the
facebook
page
that
fats
with
care
he
to
almost
nothing
else
he
had
he
had
found
on
his
parents
do
not
want
think
am
too
to
believe
in
myself
have
terrible
fear
shall
one
day
be
pronounced
holy
do
not
want
to
be
rather
even
perhaps
am
andrew
liked
it
very
much
and
fats
liked
how
impressed
he
was
in
the
time
it
took
him
to
pass
the
mere
seconds
fats
thoughts
lit
on
his
father
dead
friend
barry
fairbrother
three
long
past
the
printed
on
behind
the
glass
and
fats
saw
barry
joking
bearded
face
and
heard
cubby
booming
excuse
of
laugh
which
had
often
rung
out
almost
before
barry
had
made
one
of
his
jokes
in
the
mere
excitement
of
his
presence
fats
did
not
wish
to
examine
these
memories
any
further
he
did
not
himself
on
the
reasons
for
his
instinctive
inner
he
did
not
ask
himself
whether
the
dead
man
had
been
authentic
or
he
the
idea
of
barry
fairbrother
and
his
father
ludicrous
distress
and
pressed
on
fats
was
these
days
even
though
he
made
everybody
else
laugh
as
much
as
ever
his
to
rid
himself
of
was
an
attempt
to
something
he
was
sure
had
been
in
him
something
that
he
had
lost
as
he
had
left
childhood
what
fats
wanted
to
recover
was
kind
of
and
the
route
he
had
chosen
back
to
it
was
through
all
the
things
that
were
supposed
to
be
bad
for
you
but
which
seemed
to
fats
to
be
the
one
true
way
to
to
kind
of
it
was
curious
how
often
everything
was
back
to
front
the
of
what
they
told
you
fats
was
starting
to
think
that
if
you
every
bit
of
received
wisdom
on
its
head
you
would
have
the
truth
he
wanted
to
journey
through
dark
and
with
the
that
within
he
wanted
to
crack
open
and
he
wanted
to
break
and
wisdom
from
their
bloody
he
wanted
to
achieve
state
of
grace
and
be
backwards
into
and
and
so
he
decided
to
break
one
of
the
few
school
rules
he
had
not
yet
and
walked
away
into
the
fields
it
was
not
merely
that
the
crude
of
reality
seemed
here
than
in
any
other
place
he
knew
he
also
had
vague
hope
of
across
certain
notorious
people
about
whom
he
was
curious
and
though
he
barely
acknowledged
it
to
himself
because
it
was
one
of
the
few
for
which
he
did
not
have
words
he
sought
an
open
door
and
recognition
and
welcome
to
home
he
did
not
know
he
had
moving
past
the
coloured
houses
on
foot
rather
than
in
his
mother
car
he
noticed
that
many
of
them
were
free
of
graffiti
and
and
that
some
as
he
saw
it
the
of
pagford
with
net
curtains
and
ornaments
on
the
these
details
were
less
apparent
from
moving
where
fats
eye
was
drawn
from
boarded
window
to
strewn
lawn
the
houses
held
no
interest
for
fats
what
drew
him
on
were
the
places
where
or
was
in
evidence
even
if
only
of
the
variety
somewhere
near
here
he
did
not
know
exactly
where
lived
dane
tully
tully
family
was
his
two
older
brothers
and
his
father
spent
lot
of
time
in
there
was
that
the
last
time
dane
had
had
fight
with
nineteen
year
old
so
the
story
went
from
the
cantermill
estate
his
father
had
him
to
the
and
had
stayed
to
fight
dane
older
brothers
tully
had
turned
up
at
school
with
his
face
cut
his
lip
swollen
and
his
eye
everyone
agreed
that
he
had
put
in
one
of
his
simply
to
show
off
his
injuries
fats
was
quite
sure
that
he
would
have
played
it
differently
to
care
what
anyone
else
thought
of
your
smashed
face
was
fats
would
have
liked
to
fight
and
then
to
go
about
his
normal
life
and
if
anyone
knew
it
would
be
because
they
had
glimpsed
him
by
chance
fats
had
never
been
hit
despite
offering
he
thought
often
these
days
about
how
it
would
feel
to
get
into
fight
he
suspected
that
the
state
of
he
sought
would
violence
or
at
least
would
not
violence
to
be
prepared
to
hit
and
to
take
hit
seemed
to
him
to
be
form
of
courage
to
which
he
ought
to
he
had
never
needed
his
fists
his
tongue
had
but
the
fats
was
starting
to
his
own
and
to
authentic
the
matter
of
fats
with
himself
more
to
buy
blade
now
and
let
it
be
known
he
was
carrying
it
would
be
an
act
of
crashing
of
the
likes
of
dane
tully
fats
insides
at
the
thought
of
it
if
ever
the
time
came
when
he
needed
to
carry
knife
that
would
be
different
fats
did
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
such
time
would
come
though
he
admitted
to
himself
that
the
idea
was
fats
was
scared
of
things
that
flesh
of
needles
and
he
had
been
the
only
one
to
faint
when
they
had
had
their
back
at
st
thomas
one
of
the
few
ways
that
andrew
had
found
to
fats
was
to
his
around
him
the
filled
needle
that
andrew
was
supposed
to
carry
with
him
at
all
times
because
of
his
dangerous
it
made
fats
feel
sick
when
andrew
it
at
him
or
pretended
to
him
with
it
wandering
without
any
particular
fats
caught
sight
of
the
sign
to
foley
road
that
was
where
krystal
weedon
lived
he
was
unsure
whether
she
was
in
school
today
and
it
was
not
his
intention
to
make
her
think
that
he
had
come
looking
for
her
they
had
an
agreement
to
meet
on
friday
evening
fats
had
told
his
parents
that
he
was
going
to
andrew
because
they
were
on
an
english
krystal
seemed
to
understand
what
they
were
going
to
do
she
seemed
up
for
it
she
had
so
far
allowed
him
to
two
fingers
inside
her
hot
and
firm
and
slippery
he
had
her
bra
and
been
permitted
to
place
his
hands
on
her
warm
heavy
breasts
he
had
sought
her
out
deliberately
at
the
christmas
disco
led
her
out
of
the
hall
under
andrew
and
the
others
round
the
back
of
the
drama
hall
she
had
seemed
quite
as
surprised
as
anybody
else
but
had
offered
as
he
had
hoped
and
expected
virtually
no
his
of
krystal
had
been
act
and
he
had
had
his
cool
and
ready
when
it
had
come
to
facing
down
his
mates
and
if
you
want
chips
you
don
go
to
fucking
bar
he
had
thought
out
that
in
advance
but
he
had
still
had
to
it
out
for
them
you
boys
keep
want
shag
that
had
wiped
the
smiles
off
their
faces
he
could
tell
that
all
of
them
andrew
included
were
forced
to
down
their
at
his
choice
in
admiration
of
his
of
the
one
the
only
true
fats
had
undoubtedly
chosen
the
most
direct
route
to
get
there
none
of
them
could
argue
with
his
common
sense
and
fats
could
tell
that
every
single
one
of
them
was
asking
himself
why
he
had
not
had
the
guts
to
consider
this
means
to
most
end
do
me
favour
and
don
mention
this
to
my
mother
all
right
fats
had
muttered
to
krystal
coming
up
for
air
in
between
long
wet
of
each
other
mouths
while
his
had
rubbed
backwards
and
forwards
over
her
she
had
half
then
kissed
him
with
more
she
had
not
asked
him
why
he
had
picked
her
had
not
asked
him
anything
really
she
seemed
like
him
to
be
pleased
by
the
of
their
entirely
separate
to
glory
in
the
confusion
even
in
his
friends
of
disgust
he
and
krystal
had
barely
spoken
to
each
other
during
three
further
of
and
fats
had
all
of
them
but
she
had
made
herself
more
available
than
usual
to
hang
about
in
places
he
might
find
her
easily
friday
night
was
the
first
time
they
would
meet
by
pre
he
had
bought
the
prospect
of
finally
going
all
the
way
had
something
to
do
with
him
today
and
coming
to
the
fields
although
he
had
not
thought
of
krystal
herself
as
opposed
to
her
breasts
and
that
until
he
saw
the
name
of
her
street
fats
back
lighting
another
cigarette
something
about
seeing
the
name
of
foley
road
had
given
him
strange
sense
that
his
was
wrong
the
fields
today
were
and
and
that
which
he
sought
the
thing
he
hoped
to
recognize
when
he
found
it
was
curled
up
somewhere
out
of
sight
and
so
he
walked
back

kay
she

pause
seemed
interminable
they
had
met
in
london
at
gavin
brother
birthday
party
kay
had
not
known
anyone
there
except
for
the
friend
who
had
dragged
her
along
for
support
gavin
had
just
split
up
with
he
had
been
little
drunk
but
had
seemed
decent
and
conventional
not
at
all
the
kind
of
man
that
kay
usually
went
for
he
had
poured
out
the
story
of
his
broken
relationship
and
then
gone
home
with
her
to
the
flat
in
hackney
he
had
been
keen
while
the
affair
remained
long
distance
visiting
at
weekends
and
her
regularly
but
when
by
she
had
got
the
job
in
yarvil
for
less
money
and
put
her
flat
in
hackney
on
the
market
he
had
seemed
to
take
his
line
still
busy
would
you
like
to
hold
yes

said
kay
miserably
if
she

gavin
did

work
out
but
they
had
to
work
out
she
had
moved
for
him
changed
jobs
for
him
her
daughter
for
him
he
would
never
have
let
that
happen
surely
unless
his
were
serious
he
must
have
thought
through
the
consequences
if
they
split
up
how
awful
and
awkward
it
would
be
running
across
each
other
constantly
in
tiny
town
like
pagford
putting

the
secretary
and

of

excuses
on
the
air

became
ashamed
and

after

tightly
to
her
ear
for
few
moments
then
said
for
the
benefit
of
and
do

later
as
guidance
teacher
tessa
hours
more
than
her
husband
she
usually
waited
until
the
end
of
the
school
day
to
take
their
son
home
in
her
leaving
colin
whom
tessa
although
she
knew
what
the
rest
of
the
world
called
him
including
nearly
all
the
parents
who
had
caught
the
habit
from
their
children
never
addressed
as
cubby
to
follow
them
an
hour
or
two
later
in
his
today
though
colin
met
tessa
in
the
car
park
at
twenty
past
four
while
the
were
still
out
of
the
front
gates
into
cars
or
onto
their
free
the
sky
was
cold
iron
grey
like
the
of
sharp
breeze
lifted
the
of
and
rattled
the
leaves
on
the
trees
wind
that
sought
out
your
places
the
of
your
neck
and
your
knees
and
which
you
the
comfort
of
of
little
from
reality
even
after
she
had
closed
the
car
door
on
it
tessa
felt
and
put
out
as
she
would
have
been
by
somebody
crashing
into
her
without
beside
her
in
the
passenger
seat
his
knees
high
in
the
of
her
car
colin
told
tessa
what
the
computing
teacher
had
come
to
his
office
to
tell
him
twenty
minutes
previously
not
there
didn
turn
up
for
the
whole
double
period
said
he
thought
he
better
come
straight
and
tell
me
so
that
ll
be
all
over
the
staff
room
tomorrow
exactly
what
he
wants
said
colin
furiously
and
tessa
knew
that
they
were
not
talking
about
the
computing
teacher
any
more
he
just
sticking
two
fingers
up
at
me
as
usual
her
husband
was
pale
with
exhaustion
with
shadows
beneath
his
eyes
and
his
hands
were
slightly
on
the
handle
of
his
briefcase
fine
hands
with
big
knuckles
and
long
fingers
they
were
not
altogether
from
their
son
tessa
had
pointed
this
out
to
her
husband
and
son
recently
neither
had
the
smallest
pleasure
at
the
thought
that
there
was
some
faint
physical
resemblance
between
them
don
think
he
began
tessa
but
colin
was
talking
again
so
he
ll
get
like
everyone
else
and
ll
damn
well
punish
him
at
home
too
we
ll
see
how
he
likes
that
shall
we
we
ll
see
whether
that
laughing
matter
we
can
start
by
him
for
week
we
ll
see
how
funny
that
is
back
her
response
tessa
the
sea
of
black
students
walking
with
heads
down
drawing
their
thin
coats
close
their
hair
into
their
mouths
and
slightly
looking
first
year
was
looking
all
around
for
lift
that
had
not
arrived
the
crowd
parted
and
there
was
fats
along
with
arf
price
as
usual
the
wind
blowing
his
hair
off
his
face
sometimes
at
certain
angles
in
certain
lights
it
was
easy
to
see
what
fats
would
look
like
as
an
old
man
for
an
instant
from
the
of
her
tiredness
he
seemed
complete
stranger
and
tessa
thought
how
extraordinary
it
was
that
he
was
turning
away
to
walk
towards
her
car
and
that
she
would
have
to
go
back
out
into
that
horrible
real
breeze
to
let
him
in
but
when
he
reached
them
and
gave
her
his
small
of
smile
he
himself
immediately
into
the
boy
she
loved
in
spite
of
it
all
and
she
got
out
again
and
stood
in
the
knife
sharp
wind
while
he
folded
himself
into
the
car
with
his
father
who
had
not
offered
to
move
they
pulled
out
of
the
car
park
ahead
of
the
free
and
set
off
through
yarvil
past
the
ugly
broken
down
houses
of
the
fields
towards
the
bypass
that
would
speed
them
back
to
pagford
tessa
watched
fats
in
the
rear
view
mirror
he
was
slumped
in
the
back
gazing
out
of
the
window
as
though
his
parents
were
two
people
who
had
picked
him
up
connected
to
him
merely
by
chance
and
proximity
colin
waited
until
they
reached
the
bypass
then
he
asked
where
were
you
when
you
should
have
been
in
computing
this
afternoon
tessa
glanced
into
the
mirror
again
she
saw
her
son
sometimes
even
though
she
it
to
colin
tessa
wondered
whether
fats
really
was
dirty
personal
war
on
his
father
with
the
whole
school
as
she
knew
things
about
her
son
she
would
not
have
known
if
she
had
not
worked
in
guidance
students
told
her
things
sometimes
sometimes
miss
do
you
mind
fats
smoking
you
let
him
do
it
at
home
she
locked
away
this
small
of
and
brought
it
to
neither
her
husband
nor
her
son
attention
even
though
it
dragged
at
her
on
her
went
for
walk
fats
said
calmly
thought
stretch
the
old
legs
colin
twisted
in
his
seat
to
look
at
fats
against
his
seat
belt
as
he
shouted
his
further
and
by
his
overcoat
and
briefcase
when
he
lost
control
colin
voice
rose
higher
and
higher
so
that
he
was
shouting
almost
in
through
it
all
fats
sat
in
silence
an
half
smile
his
thin
mouth
until
his
father
was
screaming
at
him
that
were
by
colin
dislike
of
swearing
his
self
consciousness
when
he
did
it
you
self
little
little
shit
he
screamed
and
tessa
whose
eyes
were
so
full
of
tears
that
she
could
barely
see
the
road
was
sure
that
fats
would
be
colin
swearing
for
the
benefit
of
andrew
price
tomorrow
morning
fats
does
great
of
cubby
walk
miss
have
you
seen
it
how
dare
you
talk
to
me
like
that
how
dare
you
classes
colin
screamed
and
and
tessa
had
to
the
tears
out
of
her
eyes
as
she
took
the
turning
to
pagford
and
drove
through
the
square
past
mollison
and
lowe
the
war
memorial
and
the
black
canon
she
turned
left
at
st
michael
and
all
saints
into
church
row
and
at
last
into
the
of
their
house
by
which
time
colin
had
shouted
himself
into
and
tessa
cheeks
were
and
when
they
all
got
out
fats
whose
expression
had
not
during
his
father
long
let
himself
in
through
the
front
door
with
his
own
key
and
proceeded
upstairs
at
without
looking
back
colin
threw
his
briefcase
down
in
the
dark
hall
and
rounded
on
tessa
the
only
came
from
the
stained
glass
over
the
front
door
which
cast
strange
colours
over
his
and
head
half
bloody
half
blue
you
see
he
cried
his
long
arms
you
see
what
dealing
with
yes
she
said
taking
handful
of
tissues
from
the
box
on
the
hall
table
and
mopping
her
face
blowing
her
nose
yes
do
not
thought
in
his
head
for
what
we
re
going
through
said
colin
and
he
started
to
sob
big
dry
sobs
like
child
with
tessa
hurried
forward
and
put
her
arms
around
colin
chest
little
above
his
waist
for
short
and
as
she
was
that
was
the
bit
she
could
reach
he
clinging
to
her
she
could
feel
his
trembling
and
the
of
his
under
his
coat
after
few
minutes
she
gently
herself
led
him
into
the
kitchen
and
made
him
pot
of
tea
going
to
take
up
to
mary
said
tessa
after
she
had
sat
for
while
his
hand
she
got
half
the
family
there
we
ll
get
an
early
night
once
back
he
nodded
and
and
she
kissed
him
on
the
side
of
his
head
before
heading
out
to
the
freezer
when
she
came
back
carrying
the
heavy
icy
he
was
sitting
at
the
table
his
mug
in
his
big
hands
his
eyes
closed
tessa
set
down
the
wrapped
in
bag
on
the
beside
the
front
door
she
pulled
on
the
green
cardigan
she
often
wore
instead
of
jacket
but
did
not
put
on
her
shoes
instead
she
upstairs
to
the
landing
and
then
taking
less
trouble
to
be
quiet
up
the
second
flight
to
the
swift
burst
of
like
greeted
her
approach
to
the
door
she
knocked
giving
fats
time
to
hide
whatever
it
was
he
had
been
looking
at
online
or
perhaps
the
cigarettes
he
did
not
know
she
knew
about
yeah
she
pushed
open
the
door
her
son
was
crouching
over
his
school
bag
did

have
to
play
today
of
all
days
fats
straightened
up
long
and
he
over
his
mother

there

in
late
didn

stu
fine
he
said
with
half
laugh
half
she
felt
his
attention
like
back
to
his
own
concerns
even
before
she
had
closed
the
door
vi
the
wind
blew
away
the
low
hanging
of
late
afternoon
and
at
died
out
three
houses
along
from
the
walls
samantha
mollison
sat
facing
her
lamp
lit
reflection
in
the
dressing
table
mirror
and
found
the
silence
and
the
stillness
depressing
it
had
been
couple
of
days
she
had
sold
virtually
nothing
the
from
had
turned
out
to
be
man
with
an
and
hold
all
full
of
ugly
apparently
he
his
for
the
for
in
person
he
was
all
business
patronizing
her
her
stock
pushing
for
an
order
she
had
been
imagining
somebody
younger
taller
and
she
had
wanted
to
get
him
and
his
out
of
her
little
shop
as
quickly
as
possible
she
had
bought
with
sympathy
card
for
mary
fairbrother
that
lunchtime
but
could
not
think
what
to
write
in
it
because
after
their
nightmare
journey
to
the
hospital
together
simple
signature
did
not
seem
enough
their
relationship
had
never
been
close
you
up
against
each
other
all
the
time
in
place
as
small
as
pagford
but
she
and
miles
had
not
really
known
barry
and
mary
if
anything
it
might
have
been
said
that
they
were
in
what
with
howard
and
barry
endless
about
the
fields
not
that
she
samantha
gave
damn
one
way
or
another
she
held
herself
above
the
of
local
politics
tired
out
of
and
after
day
of
she
wished
that
she
and
miles
were
not
going
to
dinner
at
her
parents
in
law
watching
herself
in
the
mirror
she
put
her
hands
flat
against
the
sides
of
her
face
and
pulled
the
skin
gently
back
towards
her
ears
younger
samantha
emerged
by
turning
her
face
slowly
from
side
to
side
she
examined
this
taut
mask
better
much
better
she
wondered
what
it
would
cost
how
much
it
would
hurt
whether
she
would
dare
she
tried
to
imagine
what
her
mother
in
law
would
say
if
she
appeared
with
firm
new
face
shirley
and
howard
were
as
shirley
frequently
reminded
them
helping
to
pay
for
their
education
miles
entered
the
bedroom
samantha
released
her
skin
and
picked
up
her
under
eye
her
head
back
as
she
always
did
when
make
up
it
pulled
the
slightly
skin
at
her
jaw
taut
and
the
under
her
eyes
there
were
short
needle
deep
lines
at
the
of
her
lips
these
could
be
filled
she
had
read
with
she
wondered
how
much
difference
that
would
make
it
would
surely
be
than
and
perhaps
shirley
would
not
notice
in
the
mirror
over
her
shoulder
she
saw
miles
pulling
off
his
tie
and
shirt
his
big
belly
over
his
work
trousers
weren
you
meeting
someone
today
some
he
asked
he
scratched
his
staring
into
the
wardrobe
yes
but
it
wasn
any
good
said
samantha
stuff
miles
enjoyed
what
she
did
he
had
grown
up
in
home
where
was
the
only
business
that
mattered
and
he
had
never
lost
the
respect
for
that
howard
had
in
him
then
there
were
all
the
for
jokes
and
for
other
less
subtly
disguised
forms
of
self
that
her
line
of
miles
never
seemed
to
of
making
the
same
old
or
the
same
sly
bad
fit
he
bad
horrible
colours
samantha
brushed
and
tied
back
her
thick
dry
brown
hair
watching
miles
in
the
mirror
as
he
changed
into
and
shirt
she
was
on
edge
feeling
that
she
might
or
cry
at
the
smallest
was
only
few
minutes
away
but
church
row
was
steep
so
they
drove
darkness
was
falling
properly
and
at
the
top
of
the
road
they
passed
man
with
barry
fairbrother
and
it
gave
samantha
shock
and
she
glanced
back
at
him
wondering
who
he
could
be
miles
car
turned
left
at
the
top
of
the
road
then
barely
minute
later
right
into
the
half
moon
of
howard
and
shirley
house
low
wide
building
of
red
brick
of
green
lawn
at
the
front
and
back
which
were
into
during
the
summer
by
miles
during
the
long
years
of
their
howard
and
shirley
had
added
lamps
white
wrought
iron
gate
and
full
of
on
either
side
of
the
front
door
they
had
also
put
up
sign
beside
the
doorbell
round
polished
piece
of
wood
on
which
was
written
in
old
black
complete
with
marks
samantha
was
sometimes
at
the
of
her
parents
in
law
house
miles
her
the
that
he
and
samantha
with
their
stripped
back
and
doors
their
on
bare
boards
their
framed
art
prints
and
their
uncomfortable
sofa
had
the
better
taste
but
in
his
secret
soul
he
preferred
the
bungalow
in
which
he
had
grown
up
nearly
every
surface
was
covered
with
something
and
soft
there
were
no
and
the
chairs
were
comfortable
after
he
the
lawn
in
the
summer
shirley
would
bring
him
cool
beer
while
he
lay
back
in
one
of
them
watching
the
on
the
tv
sometimes
one
of
his
daughters
would
come
with
him
and
sit
beside
him
eating
ice
cream
with
chocolate
especially
made
for
her
by
shirley
hello
darling
said
shirley
when
she
opened
the
door
her
short
shape
suggested
neat
little
pot
in
its
apron
she
stood
on
for
her
tall
son
to
kiss
her
then
said
hello
sam
and
turned
away
immediately
dinner
nearly
ready
howard
miles
and
sam
are
here
the
house
smelt
of
furniture
polish
and
good
food
howard
emerged
from
the
kitchen
bottle
of
wine
in
one
hand
in
the
other
in
move
shirley
backed
smoothly
into
the
dining
room
howard
who
took
up
almost
the
entire
of
the
hall
to
pass
before
she
into
the
kitchen
here
they
are
the
good
boomed
howard
and
how
the
business
sammy
the
all
right
business
is
surprisingly
actually
howard
said
samantha
howard
roared
with
laughter
and
samantha
was
sure
that
he
would
have
patted
her
on
the
bottom
if
he
had
not
been
holding
the
and
bottle
she
all
of
her
father
in
law
little
and
as
the
of
man
grown
too
fat
and
old
to
do
anything
more
in
any
case
it
annoyed
shirley
which
always
pleased
samantha
shirley
never
showed
her
openly
her
smile
did
not
nor
did
her
tone
of
sweet
but
within
short
time
of
any
of
howard
mild
she
always
hidden
in
at
her
daughter
in
law
mention
of
the
girls
school
enquiries
about
samantha
asking
miles
whether
he
did
not
think
mary
fairbrother
had
an
pretty
figure
samantha
endured
it
all
smiling
and
miles
for
it
later
hello
mo
said
miles
samantha
into
what
howard
and
shirley
called
the
didn
know
you
were
going
to
be
here
hello
handsome
said
maureen
in
her
deep
voice
give
me
kiss
howard
business
partner
was
sitting
in
corner
of
the
sofa
clutching
tiny
glass
of
she
was
wearing
pink
dress
with
dark
and
high
leather
heels
her
black
hair
was
heavily
into
beneath
which
her
face
was
pale
and
with
thick
of
shocking
pink
lipstick
that
puckered
as
miles
bent
low
to
kiss
her
cheek
been
talking
business
plans
for
the
new
café
hello
sam
maureen
added
patting
the
sofa
beside
her
oh
you
are
lovely
and
is
that
still
from
come
sit
down
by
me
what
shock
for
you
at
the
golf
club
it
must
have
been
ghastly
yes
it
was
said
samantha
and
for
the
first
time
she
found
herself
telling
somebody
the
story
of
barry
death
while
miles
looking
for
chance
to
howard
handed
out
large
glasses
of
paying
close
attention
to
samantha
account
gradually
in
the
glow
of
howard
and
maureen
interest
with
the
alcohol
fire
inside
her
the
tension
samantha
had
carried
with
her
for
two
days
seemed
to
away
and
fragile
sense
of
well
being
the
room
was
warm
and
on
either
side
of
the
gas
fire
an
of
china
nearly
all
of
it
some
landmark
or
anniversary
of
the
of
ii
small
bookcase
in
the
corner
contained
mixture
of
and
the
glossy
that
had
the
kitchen
photographs
the
shelves
and
walls
miles
and
his
younger
sister
patricia
from
twin
frame
in
matching
school
miles
and
samantha
two
daughters
lexie
and
libby
were
represented
over
and
again
from
to
samantha
only
once
in
the
family
gallery
though
in
one
of
the
largest
and
most
pictures
it
showed
her
and
miles
wedding
day
sixteen
years
before
miles
was
young
and
handsome
blue
eyes
at
the
photographer
samantha
eyes
were
closed
in
half
her
face
was
turned
sideways
her
chin
was
by
her
smile
at
different
the
white
of
her
dress
strained
across
breasts
already
swollen
with
her
early
pregnancy
making
her
look
huge
one
of
maureen
thin
like
hands
was
playing
with
the
chain
she
always
wore
around
her
neck
on
which
hung
and
her
late
husband
wedding
ring
when
samantha
reached
the
point
in
her
story
where
the
doctor
told
mary
that
there
was
nothing
they
could
do
maureen
put
her
free
hand
on
samantha
and
squeezed
up
called
shirley
though
she
had
not
wanted
to
come
samantha
felt
better
than
she
had
in
two
days
maureen
and
howard
were
her
like
mixture
of
and
and
both
of
them
patted
her
gently
on
the
back
as
she
passed
them
on
her
way
into
the
dining
room
shirley
had
turned
down
the
and
lit
long
pink
to
match
the
and
the
best
the
rising
from
their
soup
plates
in
the
made
even
howard
wide
face
look
having
drunk
almost
to
the
bottom
of
her
big
wine
glass
samantha
thought
how
funny
it
would
be
if
howard
announced
that
they
were
about
to
hold
to
ask
barry
for
his
own
account
of
the
events
at
the
golf
club
well
said
howard
in
deep
voice
think
we
ought
to
raise
our
glasses
to
barry
fairbrother
samantha
back
her
glass
quickly
to
stop
shirley
seeing
that
she
had
already
most
of
its
contents
it
was
almost
certainly
an
announced
miles
the
instant
the
glasses
had
landed
back
on
the
he
had
this
information
even
from
samantha
and
he
was
glad
because
she
might
have
it
just
now
while
talking
to
maureen
and
howard
gavin
phoned
mary
to
give
the
firm
and
touch
about
the
will
and
mary
confirmed
it
basically
an
in
his
head
up
and
burst
he
had
looked
up
the
term
on
the
internet
once
he
had
found
out
how
to
it
back
in
his
office
after
speaking
to
gavin
could
have
happened
at
any
time
some
sort
of
ghastly
said
howard
but
then
he
noticed
that
samantha
glass
was
empty
and
heaved
himself
out
of
his
chair
to
top
it
up
shirley
drank
soup
for
while
with
her
eyebrows
near
her
samantha
down
more
wine
in
defiance
you
know
what
she
said
her
tongue
slightly
thought
saw
him
on
the
way
here
in
the
dark
barry
expect
it
was
one
of
his
brothers
said
shirley
they
re
all
but
maureen
croaked
over
shirley
her
out
thought
saw
the
evening
after
he
died
clear
as
day
standing
in
the
garden
looking
up
at
me
through
the
kitchen
window
in
the
middle
of
his
nobody
responded
they
had
heard
the
story
before
minute
passed
full
of
nothing
but
soft
then
maureen
spoke
again
with
her
gavin
quite
friendly
with
the
fairbrothers
isn
he
miles
doesn
he
play
with
barry
didn
he
should
say
yeah
barry
him
once
week
gavin
must
be
player
barry
had
ten
years
on
him
near
identical
of
amusement
touched
the
faces
of
the
three
women
around
the
table
if
nothing
else
they
had
in
common
slightly
interest
in
miles
young
business
partner
in
maureen
case
this
was
merely
of
her
appetite
for
all
the
gossip
of
pagford
and
the
on
of
young
were
prime
meat
shirley
took
particular
pleasure
in
hearing
all
about
gavin
and
because
these
threw
into
delicious
contrast
the
and
self
of
the
twin
of
her
life
howard
and
miles
but
in
the
case
of
samantha
gavin
and
cruelty
she
had
powerful
desire
to
see
him
slapped
awake
pulled
into
line
or
otherwise
by
feminine
she
him
little
in
person
whenever
they
met
taking
pleasure
in
the
conviction
that
he
found
her
hard
to
handle
so
how
are
things
going
these
days
asked
maureen
with
his
lady
friend
from
london
she
not
in
london
any
more
mo
she
moved
into
hope
street
said
miles
and
if
you
ask
me
he
he
ever
went
near
her
you
know
gavin
born
with
cold
feet
miles
had
been
few
years
above
gavin
at
school
and
there
was
forever
trace
of
the
sixth
form
in
the
way
he
spoke
about
his
business
partner
dark
girl
very
short
hair
that
her
said
miles
social
worker
flat
shoes
then
we
ve
had
her
in
the
deli
haven
we
how
said
maureen
wouldn
have
had
her
down
as
much
of
cook
though
not
by
the
look
of
her
of
followed
the
soup
with
the
of
howard
samantha
was
sliding
gently
towards
but
something
in
her
was
making
like
man
swept
out
to
sea
she
attempted
to
it
in
more
wine
pause
rolled
out
across
the
table
like
fresh
pristine
and
and
this
time
everybody
seemed
to
know
that
it
was
for
howard
to
set
out
the
new
he
ate
for
while
big
washed
down
with
wine
apparently
oblivious
to
their
eyes
upon
him
finally
having
cleared
half
his
plate
he
dabbed
at
his
mouth
with
his
and
spoke
yes
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
happens
on
council
now
he
was
forced
to
pause
to
powerful
for
moment
he
looked
as
if
he
might
be
sick
he
his
chest
me
yes
it
ll
be
very
interesting
indeed
with
fairbrother
gone
business
like
howard
to
the
form
of
the
name
he
used
can
see
his
article
for
the
paper
coming
off
unless
bends
your
ear
takes
it
on
obviously
he
added
howard
had
parminder
jawanda
bends
your
ear
after
her
first
as
parish
councillor
it
was
popular
joke
among
the
anti
fielders
the
look
on
her
face
said
maureen
shirley
the
look
on
her
face
when
we
told
her
well
always
thought
you
know
samantha
up
her
ears
but
maureen
was
surely
laughable
parminder
was
married
to
the
most
man
in
pagford
vikram
tall
and
well
made
with
an
nose
eyes
with
thick
black
and
knowing
smile
for
years
samantha
had
back
her
hair
and
laughed
more
often
than
necessary
whenever
she
paused
in
the
street
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
vikram
who
had
the
same
kind
of
body
miles
had
had
before
he
had
given
up
and
become
soft
and
samantha
had
heard
somewhere
not
long
after
they
had
become
her
neighbours
that
vikram
and
parminder
had
had
an
arranged
marriage
she
had
found
this
idea
imagine
being
ordered
to
marry
vikram
having
to
do
it
she
had
wrought
little
fantasy
in
which
she
was
and
shown
into
room
to
her
fate
imagine
looking
up
and
knowing
you
were
getting
that
not
to
mention
the
additional
of
his
job
that
much
responsibility
would
have
given
much
man
sex
appeal
vikram
had
performed
howard
bypass
seven
years
previously
in
vikram
could
not
enter

mr

move
aside
please
ladies
no
mr
jawanda
this
man
saved
my
life
up
the

what

it
be
mr
jawanda
sir
howard
always
insisted
that
vikram
take
free
and
little
extra
of
everything
he
bought
in
samantha
suspected
of
these
vikram
almost
never
entered
the
delicatessen
any
more
she
had
lost
the
of
the
conversation
but
it
did
not
matter
the
others
were
still
on
about
something
that
barry
fairbrother
had
written
to
the
local
paper
was
going
to
have
to
talk
to
him
about
it
boomed
howard
it
was
very
way
of
doing
things
well
well
that
water
under
the
bridge
now
what
we
should
be
thinking
about
is
who
going
to
replace
fairbrother
we
shouldn
bends
your
ear
however
upset
she
might
be
that
would
be
great
mistake
she
probably
trying
to
up
somebody
already
so
we
ought
to
be
thinking
about
decent
replacement
ourselves
sooner
rather
than
later
simple
matter
of
good
what
will
that
mean
exactly
miles
asked
an
election
possibly
said
howard
with
air
but
doubt
it
it
only
casual
vacancy
if
there
isn
enough
interest
in
an
election
though
as
say
we
must
not
bends
your
ear
but
if
she
can
raise
nine
people
to
propose
public
vote
it
ll
be
simple
question
of
co
new
councillor
in
that
case
we
need
nine
members
votes
to
get
the
co
option
nine
the
three
years
of
fairbrother
term
of
office
left
to
run
worth
it
could
swing
the
whole
thing
putting
one
of
our
side
in
instead
of
fairbrother
howard
his
thick
fingers
against
the
bowl
of
his
wine
glass
looking
at
his
son
across
the
table
both
shirley
and
maureen
were
watching
miles
too
and
miles
samantha
thought
was
looking
back
at
his
father
like
big
fat
in
expectation
of
treat
beat
later
than
she
would
have
done
if
she
had
been
samantha
realized
what
this
was
all
about
and
why
strangely
air
hung
over
the
table
her
had
been
but
all
of
sudden
it
was
for
she
was
not
sure
that
her
tongue
would
be
after
more
than
bottle
of
wine
and
long
stretch
of
silence
she
therefore
thought
the
words
rather
than
speaking
them
aloud
you
better
bloody
well
tell
them
you
ll
need
to
discuss
it
with
me
first
miles
vii
tessa
wall
had
not
meant
to
stay
long
at
mary
she
was
never
comfortable
about
leaving
her
husband
and
fats
alone
in
the
house
together
but
somehow
her
visit
had
stretched
to
couple
of
hours
the
fairbrothers
house
was
with
beds
and
sleeping
bags
their
family
had
closed
in
around
the
left
by
death
but
no
amount
of
noise
and
could
mask
the
into
which
barry
had
vanished
alone
with
her
thoughts
for
the
first
time
since
their
friend
had
died
tessa
her
steps
down
church
row
in
the
darkness
her
feet
her
cardigan
inadequate
against
the
cold
the
only
noise
was
the
of
the
wooden
around
her
neck
and
the
dim
sounds
of
television
in
the
houses
she
was
passing
quite
suddenly
tessa
thought
wonder
whether
barry
knew
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
that
her
husband
might
have
told
barry
the
great
secret
of
her
life
the
thing
that
lay
buried
at
the
heart
of
her
marriage
she
and
colin
never
even
discussed
it
though
whiff
of
it
many
conversation
particularly
lately
tonight
though
tessa
had
thought
she
caught
half
glance
from
mary
at
the
mention
of
fats
you
re
exhausted
and
you
re
imagining
things
tessa
told
herself
firmly
colin
of
secrecy
were
so
strong
so
deeply
that
he
would
never
have
told
not
even
barry
whom
he
tessa
hated
to
think
that
barry
might
have
known
that
his
kindness
towards
colin
had
been
by
pity
for
what
she
tessa
had
done
when
she
entered
the
sitting
room
she
found
her
husband
sitting
in
front
of
the
television
wearing
his
glasses
the
news
on
in
the
background
he
had
of
printed
papers
in
his
lap
and
pen
in
his
hand
to
tessa
relief
there
was
no
sign
of
fats
how
is
she
colin
asked
well
you
know
not
great
said
tessa
she
sank
into
one
of
the
old
armchairs
with
little
of
relief
and
pulled
off
her
worn
down
shoes
but
barry
brother
being
in
what
way
well
you
know
helping
she
closed
her
eyes
and
the
bridge
of
her
nose
and
her
with
her
and
always
thought
he
seemed
bit
said
colin
voice
really
said
tessa
from
the
of
her
voluntary
darkness
yes
remember
when
he
said
he
come
and
for
that
game
against
high
and
he
with
about
half
an
hour
notice
and
bateman
had
to
do
it
instead
tessa
fought
down
an
impulse
to
colin
had
habit
of
making
sweeping
based
on
first
on
single
actions
he
never
seemed
to
grasp
the
immense
of
human
nature
nor
to
that
behind
every
face
lay
wild
and
unique
like
his
own
well
he
being
lovely
with
the
kids
said
tessa
carefully
ve
got
to
go
to
bed
she
did
not
move
but
sat
on
the
separate
in
different
of
her
body
in
her
feet
her
lower
back
her
shoulders
tess
ve
been
thinking
glasses
colin
eyes
to
like
so
that
the
high
forehead
seemed
even
more
pronounced
everything
barry
was
trying
to
do
on
the
parish
council
everything
he
was
fighting
for
the
fields
the
addiction
clinic
ve
been
thinking
about
it
all
day
he
drew
deep
breath
ve
pretty
much
decided
that
going
to
take
over
for
him
crashed
over
tessa
her
to
her
chair
her
momentarily
she
struggled
to
keep
her
expression
sure
it
what
barry
would
have
wanted
said
colin
his
strange
excitement
was
with
never
said
tessa
most
honest
self
never
for
second
would
barry
have
wanted
you
to
do
this
he
would
have
known
you
are
the
very
last
person
who
ought
to
do
it
she
said
