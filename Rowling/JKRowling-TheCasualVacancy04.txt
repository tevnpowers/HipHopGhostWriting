fail
he
had
put
in
his
hours
and
that
was
that
home
was
waiting
clean
and
cool
high
on
the
hill
world
away
from
the
and
of
the
yarvil
to
in
the
after
off
time
though
now
manager
simon
had
never
ceased
to
think
in
the
terms
of
his
would
admission
that
your
home
life
was
or
worse
that
you
were
trying
to
brown
nose
management
today
though
simon
needed
to
make
before
going
home
he
met
up
with
the
gum
chewing
driver
in
the
car
park
and
together
they
drove
through
the
streets
with
the
boy
giving
directions
into
the
fields
actually
passing
the
house
in
which
simon
had
grown
up
he
had
not
been
past
the
place
for
years
his
mother
was
dead
and
he
had
not
seen
his
father
since
he
was
fourteen
and
did
not
know
where
he
was
it
and
depressed
simon
to
see
his
old
home
with
one
window
boarded
over
and
the
grass
deep
his
late
mother
had
been
house
proud
the
youth
told
simon
to
park
at
the
end
of
foley
road
then
got
out
leaving
simon
behind
and
headed
towards
house
of
particularly
appearance
from
what
simon
could
see
by
the
light
of
the
nearest
it
seemed
to
have
pile
of
filth
heaped
beneath
downstairs
window
it
was
only
now
that
simon
asked
himself
how
sensible
it
had
been
to
come
and
pick
up
the
stolen
computer
in
his
own
car
these
days
surely
they
would
have
on
the
estate
to
keep
an
eye
on
all
the
little
and
he
glanced
around
but
he
could
not
see
any
nobody
seemed
to
be
looking
at
him
except
fat
woman
who
was
openly
staring
through
one
of
the
small
square
looking
windows
simon
at
her
but
she
continued
to
watch
him
as
she
smoked
her
cigarette
so
he
his
face
with
his
hand
through
the
his
passenger
was
already
emerging
from
the
house
little
as
he
walked
back
towards
the
car
carrying
the
computer
behind
him
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
he
had
left
simon
saw
an
girl
with
small
boy
at
her
feet
who
stepped
out
of
sight
as
he
watched
dragging
the
child
with
her
simon
turned
the
key
in
the
the
engine
as
the
gum
came
careful
said
simon
leaning
across
to
the
passenger
door
just
put
it
down
here
the
boy
set
the
box
down
on
the
still
warm
passenger
seat
simon
had
intended
to
open
it
and
check
that
it
was
what
he
had
paid
for
but
growing
sense
of
his
own
the
desire
he
himself
with
giving
the
box
shove
it
was
too
heavy
to
move
easily
he
wanted
to
get
going
you
all
right
if
leave
you
here
he
called
loudly
to
the
boy
as
if
he
was
already
away
from
him
in
the
car
can
you
give
us
lift
up
to
the
hotel
sorry
mate
going
the
other
way
said
simon
simon
in
his
rear
view
mirror
he
saw
the
boy
standing
there
looking
outraged
saw
his
lips
form
the
words
fuck
you
but
simon
didn
care
if
he
cleared
out
quickly
he
might
avoid
his
number
plate
being
on
one
of
those
black
and
white
they
played
back
on
the
news
he
reached
the
bypass
ten
minutes
later
but
even
after
he
had
left
yarvil
behind
the
and
driven
up
the
hill
towards
the
ruined
abbey
he
was
and
tense
and
experienced
none
of
the
satisfaction
that
was
usually
his
when
he
the
in
the
evenings
and
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
his
own
house
far
across
the
where
pagford
lay
tiny
white
on
the
opposite
though
she
had
been
home
barely
ten
minutes
ruth
already
had
dinner
on
and
was
laying
the
table
when
simon
carried
the
computer
inside
they
kept
early
hours
in
hilltop
house
as
was
simon
ruth
of
excitement
at
the
sight
of
the
box
irritated
her
husband
she
did
not
understand
what
he
had
been
through
she
never
understood
that
there
were
involved
in
getting
stuff
cheap
for
her
part
ruth
sensed
at
once
that
simon
was
in
one
of
the
tightly
wound
that
often
an
and
the
only
way
she
knew
how
by
brightly
about
her
day
in
the
hope
that
the
mood
would
once
he
had
food
inside
him
and
as
long
as
nothing
else
happened
to
him
promptly
at
six
clock
by
which
time
simon
had
the
computer
and
discovered
that
there
was
no
the
family
sat
down
to
eat
andrew
could
tell
that
his
mother
was
on
edge
because
she
was
making
conversation
with
familiar
note
in
her
voice
she
seemed
to
think
despite
years
of
experience
that
if
she
made
the
atmosphere
polite
enough
his
father
would
not
dare
it
andrew
helped
himself
to
shepherd
pie
made
by
ruth
and
on
work
nights
and
avoided
eye
contact
with
simon
he
had
more
interesting
things
to
think
about
than
his
parents
gaia
bawden
had
said
hi
to
him
when
he
had
come
face
to
face
with
her
outside
the
said
it
automatically
and
casually
but
had
not
looked
at
him
once
all
lesson
andrew
wished
he
knew
more
about
girls
he
had
never
got
to
know
one
well
enough
to
how
their
minds
worked
the
gap
in
his
knowledge
had
not
mattered
much
until
gaia
had
walked
onto
the
school
bus
for
the
first
time
and
in
him
sharp
interest
on
her
as
an
individual
quite
different
feeling
to
the
wide
and
impersonal
fascination
that
had
been
in
him
over
several
years
concerned
with
the
of
breasts
and
the
appearance
of
bra
through
white
school
shirts
and
his
slightly
interest
in
what
actually
fats
had
girl
cousins
who
sometimes
came
to
visit
once
going
into
the
walls
bathroom
right
after
the
of
them
had
used
it
andrew
had
found
lying
beside
the
bathroom
bin
this
actual
physical
evidence
that
girl
in
his
was
having
period
there
and
then
was
to
thirteen
year
old
andrew
to
the
of
rare
he
had
had
enough
sense
not
to
tell
fats
what
he
had
seen
or
found
or
how
discovery
it
had
been
instead
he
had
picked
up
the
between
his
dropped
it
quickly
into
the
bin
then
washed
his
hands
more
vigorously
than
he
had
ever
washed
them
in
his
life
andrew
spent
lot
of
time
staring
at
gaia
facebook
page
on
his
laptop
it
was
almost
more
intimidating
than
she
was
in
person
he
spent
hours
over
photographs
of
the
people
that
she
had
left
behind
in
the
capital
she
came
from
different
world
she
had
black
friends
friends
friends
with
names
he
could
never
have
pronounced
there
was
photograph
of
her
in
that
was
burnt
into
his
brain
and
another
of
her
leaning
up
against
good
looking
coffee
skinned
boy
he
had
no
and
actual
by
process
of
careful
examination
of
all
her
messages
andrew
had
that
this
was
an
eighteen
year
old
called
marco
de
luca
andrew
stared
at
marco
and
gaia
with
the
concentration
of
code
unable
to
decide
whether
they
indicated
continuing
relationship
or
not
his
facebook
was
often
with
anxiety
because
simon
whose
understanding
of
how
the
internet
worked
was
limited
and
who
it
as
the
only
area
of
his
sons
life
where
they
were
and
more
at
ease
than
he
would
sometimes
unexpectedly
into
their
bedrooms
to
check
what
they
were
simon
claimed
that
he
was
making
sure
that
they
were
not
running
up
huge
bills
but
andrew
knew
it
to
be
one
more
of
his
father
need
to
control
and
the
constantly
over
the
box
that
would
shut
the
page
whenever
he
was
gaia
details
online
ruth
was
still
rattling
from
to
in
attempt
to
make
simon
more
than
she
said
suddenly
forgot
spoke
to
shirley
today
simon
about
you
maybe
standing
for
the
parish
council
the
words
hit
andrew
like
punch
you
re
standing
for
the
council
he
simon
slowly
raised
his
eyebrows
one
of
the
muscles
in
his
jaw
was
is
that
problem
he
asked
in
voice
that
throbbed
with
no
lied
andrew
you
ve
got
to
be
fucking
joking
you
standing
for
election
oh
fuck
no
it
sounds
like
you
ve
got
problem
with
it
said
simon
still
staring
straight
into
andrew
eyes
no
said
andrew
again
dropping
his
gaze
to
his
shepherd
pie
what
wrong
with
me
standing
for
the
council
simon
continued
he
was
not
about
to
let
it
go
he
wanted
to
his
tension
in
of
rage
nothing
wrong
was
surprised
that
all
should
have
you
first
said
simon
no
oh
thank
you
said
simon
his
lower
jaw
was
as
it
often
did
when
he
was
working
up
to
losing
control
have
you
found
job
yet
you
little
shit
no
simon
glared
at
andrew
not
eating
but
holding
of
shepherd
pie
in
air
andrew
switched
his
attention
back
to
his
food
determined
not
to
offer
further
the
air
pressure
within
the
kitchen
seemed
to
have
increased
paul
knife
rattled
against
his
plate
shirley
says
ruth
up
again
her
voice
high
pitched
determined
to
pretend
all
was
well
until
this
became
impossible
that
it
ll
be
on
the
council
website
simon
about
how
you
put
your
name
forward
simon
did
not
respond
her
last
best
attempt
ruth
fell
silent
too
she
was
afraid
that
she
might
know
what
was
at
the
of
simon
bad
mood
anxiety
at
her
she
was
she
always
had
been
she
couldn
help
it
she
knew
that
it
drove
simon
mad
when
she
him
for
reassurance
she
must
not
say
anything
si
what
it
all
right
isn
it
about
the
computer
she
was
dreadful
she
tried
to
make
her
voice
casual
and
calm
but
it
was
and
high
pitched
this
was
not
the
first
time
stolen
goods
had
entered
their
home
simon
had
found
way
of
fiddling
the
too
and
did
small
jobs
on
the
side
at
the
printworks
for
cash
all
of
it
gave
her
little
in
the
stomach
kept
her
awake
at
night
but
simon
was
of
people
who
did
not
dare
take
the
and
part
of
what
she
had
loved
about
him
from
the
beginning
was
that
this
rough
and
wild
boy
who
was
rude
and
aggressive
to
nearly
everyone
had
taken
the
trouble
to
attract
her
that
he
who
was
so
difficult
to
please
had
selected
her
alone
as
worthy
what
are
you
talking
about
simon
asked
quietly
the
full
focus
of
his
attention
shifted
from
andrew
to
ruth
and
was
expressed
by
the
same
well
there
won
be
any
any
trouble
about
it
will
there
simon
was
seized
with
brutal
urge
to
punish
her
for
his
own
fears
and
for
them
with
her
anxiety
yeah
well
wasn
going
to
say
anything
he
said
speaking
slowly
giving
himself
time
to
make
up
story
but
there
was
bit
of
trouble
when
they
were
as
it
out
andrew
and
paul
paused
in
their
eating
and
stared
some
security
guard
got
beaten
up
didn
know
anything
about
it
till
it
was
too
late
only
hope
there
no
ruth
could
barely
breathe
she
could
not
believe
the
of
his
tone
the
with
which
he
spoke
of
violent
this
explained
his
mood
when
he
had
come
home
this
explained
everything
that
why
it
nobody
we
ve
got
it
said
simon
he
each
of
them
to
glare
to
impress
the
on
them
by
force
of
personality
we
won
ruth
breathed
her
rapid
imagination
was
already
showing
her
the
police
at
the
door
the
computer
examined
simon
accused
of
did
you
hear
dad
she
said
to
her
sons
in
voice
barely
louder
than
whisper
you
mustn
tell
anybody
we
ve
got
new
computer
it
should
be
all
right
said
simon
it
should
be
fine
as
long
as
everyone
keeps
their
shut
he
turned
his
attention
back
to
his
shepherd
pie
ruth
eyes
from
simon
to
her
sons
and
back
again
paul
was
pushing
food
around
his
plate
silent
frightened
but
andrew
had
not
believed
word
his
father
said
you
re
lying
fucking
bastard
you
just
like
her
when
the
meal
was
finished
simon
got
up
and
said
well
let
see
whether
the
bloody
thing
works
at
least
you
he
pointed
at
paul
go
and
get
it
out
of
the
box
and
put
it
carefully
carefully
on
the
stand
you
he
pointed
at
andrew
you
do
computing
don
you
you
can
tell
me
what
to
do
simon
led
the
way
into
the
sitting
room
andrew
knew
that
he
was
trying
to
catch
them
out
that
he
wanted
them
to
mess
up
paul
who
was
small
and
nervous
might
drop
the
computer
and
he
andrew
was
sure
to
behind
them
in
the
kitchen
ruth
was
around
clearing
away
the
dinner
things
she
at
least
was
out
of
the
immediate
line
of
fire
andrew
went
to
assist
paul
as
he
lifted
the
hard
drive
he
can
do
it
he
not
that
much
of
snapped
simon
by
paul
his
arms
trembling
set
it
down
on
the
stand
without
then
waited
with
his
arms
dangling
at
his
sides
simon
access
to
the
machine
get
out
of
my
way
you
stupid
little
simon
shouted
paul
off
to
watch
from
behind
the
sofa
simon
picked
up
lead
at
and
addressed
andrew
where
do
put
this
up
your
you
bastard
if
you
give
it
to
me
asking
where
fucking
put
it
roared
simon
you
do
computing
tell
me
where
it
goes
andrew
leaned
around
the
back
of
the
computer
he
simon
wrong
at
first
but
then
by
chance
got
the
right
they
had
nearly
finished
by
the
time
ruth
joined
them
in
the
sitting
room
andrew
could
tell
from
one
fleeting
look
at
her
that
she
did
not
want
the
thing
to
work
that
she
wanted
simon
to
it
somewhere
and
never
mind
the
simon
sat
down
in
front
of
the
monitor
after
several
attempts
he
realized
that
the
mouse
had
no
in
it
paul
was
sent
from
the
room
to
fetch
some
from
the
kitchen
when
he
held
them
out
to
his
father
on
his
return
simon
snatched
them
out
of
his
hand
as
if
paul
might
try
and
them
away
his
tongue
down
between
his
lower
teeth
and
his
lip
so
that
his
chin
out
simon
made
an
over
fiddling
business
of
the
he
always
pulled
this
mad
face
as
warning
that
he
was
reaching
the
end
of
his
descending
into
the
place
where
he
could
not
be
held
for
his
actions
andrew
imagined
walking
out
and
leaving
his
father
to
it
him
of
the
he
preferred
when
working
himself
up
he
could
almost
feel
the
mouse
him
behind
the
ear
as
in
his
imagination
he
turned
his
back
get
fucking
in
simon
began
to
the
low
animal
noise
unique
to
him
that
his
aggressively
face
thing
you
fucking
do
it
you
you
ve
got
little
girl
fingers
simon
slammed
the
control
and
the
into
paul
chest
paul
hands
shook
as
he
fitted
the
little
metal
into
place
he
snapped
the
plastic
cover
shut
and
held
the
back
out
to
his
father
thank
you
simon
chin
was
still
like
he
acted
as
though
objects
were
to
him
once
again
he
placed
the
mouse
on
the
let
it
work
small
white
appeared
on
screen
and
around
at
simon
command
of
fear
was
released
relief
through
three
of
the
simon
stopped
pulling
his
face
andrew
line
of
men
and
woman
in
white
coats
the
people
who
had
this
machine
all
of
them
with
delicate
fingers
like
paul
they
were
to
him
and
gentle
silently
andrew
them
and
their
families
they
would
never
know
how
much
had
hung
on
this
particular
machine
working
ruth
andrew
and
paul
waited
while
simon
put
the
computer
through
its
he
brought
up
had
difficulty
getting
rid
of
them
clicked
whose
functions
he
did
not
understand
and
was
confused
by
the
but
he
had
descended
from
the
of
dangerous
rage
having
his
way
back
to
the
he
said
looking
up
at
ruth
seems
all
right
doesn
it
it
great
she
said
at
once
forcing
smile
as
though
the
last
half
hour
had
not
happened
he
had
bought
the
machine
at
and
connected
it
without
the
threat
of
violence
it
simon
much
than
the
last
one
he
hasn
opened
the
internet
yet
you
silly
woman
yeah
thought
that
too
he
glared
at
his
two
sons
this
is
brand
new
and
expensive
so
you
two
treat
it
with
respect
you
understand
and
don
tell
anyone
we
ve
got
it
simon
added
and
of
chilled
the
room
all
right
do
you
understand
me
they
nodded
again
paul
face
was
tight
and
by
his
father
he
figure
of
eight
on
the
outside
of
his
leg
with
his
and
one
of
you
draw
the
bloody
curtains
why
are
they
still
open
because
we
ve
all
been
standing
here
watching
you
behave
like
andrew
pulled
the
curtains
shut
and
left
the
room
even
after
he
had
reached
his
bedroom
and
back
down
on
his
bed
andrew
was
unable
to
his
on
the
person
of
gaia
bawden
the
prospect
of
his
father
standing
for
the
council
had
out
of
nowhere
like
some
its
shadow
over
everything
even
gaia
for
all
of
andrew
life
simon
had
been
of
his
own
contempt
for
other
people
making
his
house
against
the
world
where
his
will
was
law
and
where
his
mood
constituted
the
family
daily
weather
as
he
had
grown
older
andrew
had
become
aware
that
his
family
almost
total
was
not
and
become
slightly
embarrassed
by
it
friends
parents
would
ask
him
where
he
lived
unable
to
place
his
family
they
would
ask
casual
questions
about
whether
his
mother
or
father
intended
to
come
to
social
events
or
sometimes
they
remembered
ruth
from
the
primary
school
years
when
mothers
in
the
she
was
much
more
than
simon
perhaps
if
she
had
not
married
such
an
man
she
would
have
been
more
like
fats
mother
meeting
friends
for
lunch
or
dinner
connected
to
the
town
on
the
very
rare
occasions
that
simon
came
face
to
face
with
person
whom
he
felt
it
worth
he
adopted
of
the
earth
that
made
andrew
simon
would
talk
over
them
crack
jokes
and
often
stepped
on
all
of
because
he
neither
knew
anything
nor
much
about
the
people
with
whom
he
was
forced
to
lately
andrew
had
asked
himself
whether
simon
even
saw
other
as
real
why
his
father
had
been
seized
with
the
to
on
wider
stage
andrew
could
not
but
was
surely
inevitable
andrew
knew
other
parents
the
sort
who
did
to
raise
money
for
the
square
new
christmas
lights
or
ran
the
or
set
up
book
simon
did
nothing
that
required
and
had
never
the
smallest
interest
in
anything
that
did
not
benefit
him
directly
awful
in
andrew
mind
simon
making
speech
with
the
lies
that
his
wife
swallowed
whole
simon
pulling
his
face
in
an
attempt
to
an
simon
losing
control
and
starting
to
all
his
favourite
into
fucking
shit
andrew
pulled
his
laptop
towards
him
but
pushed
it
away
again
almost
at
once
he
made
no
move
to
touch
the
mobile
on
his
desk
this
of
anxiety
and
shame
could
not
be
contained
in
an
instant
message
or
text
he
was
alone
with
it
and
even
fats
would
not
understand
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
friday
barry
fairbrother
body
had
been
moved
to
the
the
deep
black
cuts
in
the
white
like
the
of
on
ice
were
hidden
by
his
of
thick
hair
cold
and
empty
the
body
lay
re
dressed
in
barry
anniversary
dinner
shirt
and
trousers
in
lit
room
where
soft
music
played
of
make
up
had
returned
life
like
glow
to
his
skin
it
was
almost
as
though
he
slept
but
not
quite
barry
two
brothers
his
widow
and
his
four
children
went
to
the
body
goodbye
on
the
of
the
mary
had
been
almost
until
the
minute
of
departure
as
to
whether
she
should
all
of
the
children
to
see
their
father
remains
declan
was
sensitive
boy
to
it
was
while
she
was
still
in
of
on
friday
afternoon
that
there
was
an
upset
colin
cubby
wall
had
decided
that
he
wanted
to
go
and
say
goodbye
to
barry
body
too
mary
usually
and
agreeable
had
found
this
her
voice
had
grown
on
the
telephone
to
tessa
then
she
had
begun
to
cry
again
and
said
that
it
was
just
that
she
had
not
planned
large
past
barry
that
this
was
really
family
affair
tessa
said
that
she
quite
understood
and
was
then
left
to
explain
to
colin
who
into
silence
he
had
simply
wanted
to
stand
alone
beside
barry
body
and
pay
silent
to
man
who
had
occupied
unique
place
in
his
life
colin
had
poured
and
secrets
he
had
confided
to
no
other
friend
into
barry
ears
and
barry
small
brown
eyes
robin
bright
had
never
ceased
to
him
with
warmth
and
kindness
barry
had
been
colin
closest
ever
friend
giving
him
an
experience
of
male
he
had
never
known
before
moving
to
pagford
and
was
sure
he
would
never
have
again
that
he
colin
who
felt
himself
to
be
the
and
the
for
whom
life
was
matter
of
daily
struggle
had
managed
to
friendship
with
the
popular
and
barry
had
always
seemed
small
colin
clutched
what
was
left
of
his
dignity
to
him
never
to
hold
this
against
mary
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
on
how
surprised
and
hurt
barry
would
have
been
surely
at
his
widow
attitude
three
miles
outside
pagford
in
an
attractive
cottage
called
the
gavin
hughes
was
trying
to
fight
off
an
mary
had
called
earlier
in
voice
that
with
the
weight
of
tears
she
had
explained
how
the
children
had
all
ideas
for
tomorrow
funeral
service
siobhan
had
grown
from
and
was
going
to
cut
it
and
put
it
on
top
of
the
coffin
all
four
kids
had
written
letters
to
put
inside
the
with
their
father
mary
had
one
too
and
was
going
to
put
it
in
barry
shirt
pocket
over
his
heart
gavin
put
down
the
receiver
he
did
not
want
to
know
about
the
children
letters
nor
about
the
long
yet
his
mind
kept
returning
to
these
things
as
he
ate
alone
at
his
kitchen
table
though
he
would
have
done
anything
to
avoid
reading
it
he
kept
trying
to
imagine
what
mary
had
written
in
her
letter
black
suit
was
hanging
in
dry
in
his
bedroom
like
an
unwelcome
guest
his
of
the
mary
had
done
him
in
him
as
one
of
those
closest
to
the
popular
barry
had
long
since
been
by
dread
by
the
time
he
was
washing
up
his
plate
and
at
the
sink
gavin
would
have
missed
the
funeral
altogether
as
for
the
idea
of
his
dead
friend
body
it
had
not
and
would
never
have
occurred
to
him
he
and
kay
had
had
nasty
row
the
previous
evening
and
had
not
spoken
since
it
had
all
been
by
kay
asking
gavin
if
he
would
like
her
to
go
with
him
to
the
funeral
christ
no
gavin
had
said
before
he
could
stop
himself
he
had
seen
her
expression
and
knew
instantly
that
she
had
heard
christ
no
people
will
think
we
re
couple
christ
no
why
would
want
you
and
although
these
were
precisely
his
feelings
he
had
attempted
to
his
way
through
mean
you
didn
know
him
did
you
it
be
bit
wouldn
it
but
kay
had
let
tried
to
corner
him
to
make
him
tell
her
what
he
really
felt
what
he
wanted
what
future
he
for
the
two
of
them
he
had
fought
back
with
every
weapon
in
his
being
and
for
it
was
wonderful
how
you
could
an
emotional
issue
by
to
at
last
she
had
told
him
to
get
out
of
her
house
he
had
but
he
knew
that
it
was
not
over
that
would
be
way
too
much
to
hope
for
gavin
reflection
in
the
kitchen
window
was
drawn
and
miserable
barry
stolen
future
seemed
to
hang
over
his
own
life
like
he
felt
inadequate
and
guilty
but
he
still
wished
that
kay
would
move
back
to
london
night
drew
in
over
pagford
and
in
the
old
vicarage
parminder
jawanda
her
wardrobe
wondering
what
to
wear
to
say
goodbye
to
barry
she
had
several
dark
dresses
and
any
one
of
which
would
be
appropriate
and
yet
still
she
looked
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
of
clothes
in
wear
it
ll
upset
shirley
mollison
go
on
wear
it
was
so
stupid
to
think
that
mad
and
wrong
and
even
worse
to
think
it
in
barry
voice
barry
was
dead
she
had
endured
nearly
five
days
of
deep
grief
for
him
and
tomorrow
they
would
him
in
the
earth
the
prospect
was
unpleasant
to
parminder
she
had
always
hated
the
idea
of
of
body
lying
whole
under
the
ground
slowly
away
with
and
flies
the
way
was
to
and
to
the
in
running
water
she
let
her
eyes
up
and
down
the
hanging
but
her
worn
to
family
and
get
back
in
seemed
to
call
to
her
what
was
this
strange
urge
to
don
one
it
felt
she
reached
out
to
touch
the
of
her
favourite
dark
blue
and
gold
she
had
last
worn
it
to
the
fairbrothers
new
year
party
when
barry
had
attempted
to
teach
her
to
it
had
been
most
because
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
himself
but
she
could
remember
laughing
as
she
almost
never
laughed
uncontrollably
the
way
she
had
seen
drunk
women
laugh
the
was
elegant
and
feminine
of
middle
aged
spread
parminder
mother
who
was
two
wore
it
daily
parminder
herself
had
no
need
of
its
she
was
as
as
she
had
been
at
twenty
yet
she
pulled
out
the
long
dark
length
of
soft
material
and
held
it
up
against
her
dressing
gown
letting
it
fall
to
her
bare
feet
looking
down
its
length
at
its
to
wear
it
would
feel
like
private
joke
between
herself
and
barry
like
the
cow
faced
house
and
all
the
funny
things
barry
had
said
about
howard
as
they
walked
away
from
interminable
ill
council
meetings
there
was
terrible
weight
on
parminder
chest
but
did
not
the
friends
and
relatives
of
the
dead
not
to
show
grief
but
to
their
loved
one
with
god
in
an
effort
to
keep
tears
at
bay
parminder
silently
the
night
time
the
my
friend
urge
you
that
this
is
the
time
to
serve
the
saints
profit
in
this
world
and
live
in
peace
and
comfort
in
the
next
life
is
day
and
night
mind
meet
the
and
set
right
your
affairs
lying
on
her
bed
in
her
dark
room
sukhvinder
could
hear
what
every
member
of
her
family
was
doing
there
was
the
distant
murmur
of
the
television
directly
below
her
by
the
muffled
laughter
of
her
brother
and
her
father
who
were
watching
friday
night
show
she
could
make
out
her
sister
voice
across
the
landing
talking
on
her
mobile
to
one
of
her
many
friends
nearest
of
all
was
her
mother
and
in
the
built
in
wardrobe
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
sukhvinder
had
drawn
the
curtains
over
her
window
and
placed
shaped
like
long
dog
along
the
bottom
of
her
door
in
the
absence
of
lock
the
dog
the
door
progress
it
gave
her
warning
she
was
sure
that
nobody
would
come
in
though
she
was
where
she
ought
to
be
doing
what
she
ought
to
be
doing
or
so
they
thought
she
had
just
performed
one
of
her
dreadful
daily
the
opening
of
her
facebook
page
and
the
of
another
post
from
she
did
not
know
as
often
as
she
the
person
her
with
these
messages
they
changed
their
and
sent
more
she
never
knew
when
one
would
appear
today
had
been
black
and
white
image
copy
of
century
miss
anne
it
showed
the
photograph
of
woman
in
dress
with
long
dark
hair
and
and
she
was
convinced
that
it
was
fats
wall
who
was
sending
them
although
it
might
have
been
somebody
else
dane
tully
and
his
friends
for
who
made
soft
like
noises
whenever
she
spoke
in
english
they
would
have
done
it
to
anybody
of
her
colour
there
were
hardly
any
brown
faces
at
winterdown
it
made
her
feel
and
stupid
especially
as
mr
never
told
them
off
he
affected
not
to
hear
them
or
else
to
hear
only
background
perhaps
he
too
thought
that
sukhvinder
jawanda
was
an
sukhvinder
lay
on
her
back
on
top
of
her
covers
and
wished
with
all
of
her
being
that
she
was
dead
if
she
could
have
achieved
suicide
simply
by
willing
it
she
would
have
done
it
without
death
had
come
to
mr
fairbrother
why
could
it
not
happen
to
her
better
yet
why
could
they
not
places
niamh
and
siobhan
could
have
their
father
back
and
she
sukhvinder
could
simply
slip
into
non
being
wiped
out
wiped
clean
her
self
disgust
was
like
suit
every
part
of
her
and
burnt
with
it
she
had
to
will
herself
moment
by
moment
to
to
remain
not
to
rush
to
do
the
one
and
only
thing
that
helped
the
whole
family
had
to
be
in
bed
before
she
acted
but
it
was
to
lie
like
this
listening
to
her
own
breathing
conscious
of
the
useless
weight
of
her
own
ugly
and
body
on
the
bed
she
liked
to
think
of
of
down
into
cool
green
water
and
feeling
herself
slowly
pressed
into
the
great
quiet
and
still
shame
ran
down
her
body
like
burning
rash
as
she
lay
in
the
darkness
she
had
never
heard
the
word
before
fats
wall
spoke
it
in
maths
on
wednesday
she
would
not
have
been
able
to
look
it
up
she
was
but
he
had
been
kind
enough
to
explain
what
it
meant
so
there
was
no
need
the
man
woman
he
was
worse
than
dane
tully
whose
had
no
variety
fats
wall
evil
tongue
fresh
made
every
time
he
saw
her
and
she
could
not
shut
her
ears
his
every
and
was
on
sukhvinder
memory
sticking
there
as
no
useful
fact
had
ever
done
if
she
could
have
been
examined
on
the
things
he
had
called
her
she
would
have
achieved
the
first
of
her
life
the
bearded
dumb
bell
heavy
and
stupid
plain
and
according
to
her
mother
whose
criticism
and
down
upon
her
daily
bit
slow
according
to
her
father
who
said
it
with
an
affection
that
did
not
his
lack
of
interest
he
could
afford
to
be
nice
about
her
bad
he
had
jaswant
and
rajpal
both
top
of
every
class
they
took
poor
old
vikram
would
say
after
glancing
through
her
report
but
her
father
indifference
was
preferable
to
her
mother
anger
parminder
did
not
seem
able
to
or
accept
that
she
had
produced
child
who
was
not
if
any
of
the
subject
teachers
made
the
slightest
hint
that
sukhvinder
might
try
parminder
seized
upon
it
in
triumph
sukhvinder
is
easily
and
needs
to
have
more
faith
in
her
there
you
see
your
teacher
is
saying
you
don
try
hard
enough
sukhvinder
of
the
only
class
in
which
sukhvinder
had
reached
the
second
set
computing
fats
wall
was
not
there
so
she
sometimes
dared
put
up
her
hand
to
answer
questions
parminder
said
the
amount
of
time
you
children
spend
on
the
internet
surprised
you
re
not
in
set
one
never
would
it
have
occurred
to
sukhvinder
to
tell
either
of
her
parents
about
the
or
about
stuart
wall
endless
stream
of
it
would
mean
that
people
beyond
the
family
also
saw
her
as
standard
and
in
any
case
parminder
was
friends
with
stuart
wall
mother
sukhvinder
sometimes
wondered
why
stuart
wall
did
not
worry
about
their
mothers
connection
but
that
he
knew
that
she
would
not
give
him
away
he
saw
through
her
he
saw
her
as
he
knew
her
every
worst
thought
about
herself
and
was
able
to
it
for
the
amusement
of
andrew
price
she
had
fancied
andrew
price
once
before
she
realized
that
she
was
to
fancy
anyone
before
she
realized
that
she
was
laughable
and
strange
sukhvinder
heard
her
father
voice
and
rajpal
growing
louder
as
they
came
up
the
stairs
rajpal
laughter
reached
right
outside
her
door
it
late
she
heard
her
mother
call
from
her
bedroom
vikram
he
should
be
in
bed
vikram
voice
came
through
sukhvinder
door
close
by
loud
and
warm
are
you
asleep
already
it
was
her
childhood
in
jaswant
had
been
and
sukhvinder
unhappy
baby
rarely
smiling
had
become
no
sukhvinder
called
back
ve
only
just
gone
to
bed
well
it
might
interest
you
to
know
that
your
brother
here
but
what
rajpal
had
done
was
lost
in
his
shouting
his
laughter
she
heard
vikram
moving
away
still
rajpal
sukhvinder
waited
for
the
house
to
fall
silent
she
clung
to
the
prospect
of
her
only
as
she
would
have
life
belt
waiting
waiting
for
them
all
to
go
to
bed
and
as
she
waited
she
remembered
that
evening
not
long
ago
at
the
end
of
rowing
training
when
they
had
been
walking
through
the
darkness
towards
the
car
park
by
the
canal
you
were
so
tired
after
rowing
your
arms
and
your
stomach
muscles
but
it
was
good
clean
pain
she
always
slept
properly
after
rowing
and
then
krystal
bringing
up
the
rear
of
the
group
with
sukhvinder
had
called
her
silly
bitch
it
had
come
out
of
nowhere
they
had
all
been
around
with
mr
fairbrother
krystal
thought
she
was
being
funny
she
used
fucking
with
very
and
seemed
to
see
no
difference
between
them
now
she
said
as
she
would
have
said
or
dim
sukhvinder
was
conscious
of
her
face
falling
and
experienced
the
familiar
sliding
sensation
in
her
stomach
what
did
you
say
mr
fairbrother
had
wheeled
around
to
face
krystal
none
of
them
had
ever
heard
him
properly
angry
before
di
mean
nuthin
said
krystal
half
taken
aback
half
was
on
she
knows
was
jus
don
yeh
she
demanded
of
sukhvinder
who
muttered
that
she
knew
it
was
joke
never
want
to
hear
you
use
that
word
again
they
all
knew
how
much
he
liked
krystal
they
all
knew
he
had
paid
for
her
to
go
on
couple
of
their
out
of
his
own
pocket
nobody
laughed
louder
than
mr
fairbrother
at
krystal
jokes
she
could
be
very
funny
they
walked
on
and
everybody
was
embarrassed
sukhvinder
was
afraid
to
look
at
krystal
she
felt
guilty
as
she
always
did
they
were
approaching
the
people
carrier
when
krystal
said
so
quietly
that
even
mr
fairbrother
did
not
hear
it
wuz
and
sukhvinder
said
quickly
know
yeah
well
it
came
out
as
and
sukhvinder
thought
it
not
to
acknowledge
it
it
her
out
it
her
dignity
on
the
way
back
to
pagford
she
for
the
first
time
ever
the
singing
of
the
team
lucky
song
asking
krystal
to
start
with
slowly
very
slowly
her
family
seemed
to
be
putting
themselves
to
bed
at
last
jaswant
spent
long
time
in
the
bathroom
and
crashing
around
sukhvinder
waited
until
had
finished
herself
until
her
parents
had
stopped
talking
in
their
room
for
the
house
to
fall
silent
then
at
last
it
was
safe
she
sat
up
and
pulled
the
blade
out
from
hole
in
the
ear
of
her
old
she
had
stolen
the
blade
from
vikram
store
in
the
bathroom
cabinet
she
got
off
the
bed
and
for
the
torch
on
her
shelf
and
handful
of
tissues
then
moved
into
the
part
of
her
room
into
the
little
round
in
the
corner
here
she
knew
the
torch
light
would
be
and
would
not
show
around
the
of
the
door
she
sat
down
with
her
back
against
the
wall
pushed
up
the
sleeve
of
her
and
examined
by
the
marks
left
by
her
last
session
still
visible
criss
crossed
and
dark
on
her
arm
but
with
slight
of
fear
that
was
relief
in
its
narrow
immediate
focus
she
placed
the
blade
halfway
up
her
and
into
her
own
flesh
sharp
hot
pain
and
the
blood
came
at
once
when
she
had
cut
herself
right
up
to
her
elbow
she
pressed
the
of
tissues
onto
the
long
wound
making
sure
nothing
onto
her
or
the
carpet
after
minute
or
two
she
cut
again
across
the
first
making
pausing
to
press
and
to
mop
as
she
went
the
blade
drew
the
pain
away
from
her
screaming
thoughts
and
it
into
animal
burning
of
nerves
and
skin
relief
and
release
in
every
cut
at
last
she
wiped
the
blade
clean
and
the
mess
she
had
made
the
so
much
that
tears
were
down
her
face
she
might
sleep
if
the
pain
did
not
keep
her
awake
but
she
must
wait
for
ten
or
twenty
minutes
until
the
fresh
cuts
had
over
she
sat
with
her
knees
drawn
up
closed
her
wet
eyes
and
leaned
against
the
wall
beneath
the
window
some
of
her
self
hatred
had
out
with
the
blood
her
mind
drifted
away
to
gaia
bawden
the
new
girl
who
had
taken
such
an
fancy
to
her
gaia
could
have
hung
out
with
anyone
with
her
looks
and
that
london
accent
yet
she
kept
seeking
out
sukhvinder
at
and
on
the
bus
sukhvinder
did
not
understand
it
she
almost
wanted
to
ask
gaia
what
she
thought
she
was
playing
at
day
by
day
she
expected
the
new
girl
to
realize
that
she
sukhvinder
was
and
like
slow
and
stupid
someone
to
be
despised
and
at
and
no
doubt
she
would
recognize
her
mistake
soon
and
sukhvinder
would
be
left
as
usual
to
the
bored
pity
of
her
oldest
friends
the
fairbrother
twins
saturday
every
parking
space
in
church
row
was
taken
by
nine
clock
in
the
morning
moved
in
pairs
and
in
up
and
down
the
street
like
stream
of
iron
drawn
to
on
st
michael
and
all
saints
the
path
leading
to
the
church
doors
became
crowded
then
those
who
were
out
among
the
seeking
safe
to
stand
between
the
of
on
the
dead
yet
unwilling
to
move
too
far
from
the
church
entrance
it
was
clear
to
everyone
that
there
would
not
be
enough
for
all
the
people
who
had
come
to
say
goodbye
to
barry
fairbrother
his
co
workers
from
the
bank
who
were
grouped
around
the
most
of
the
sweetlove
wished
that
the
from
head
office
would
move
on
and
take
his
small
talk
and
his
jokes
with
him
and
from
the
rowing
team
had
separated
from
their
parents
to
together
in
the
of
parish
councillors
bunch
talked
in
the
middle
of
the
path
of
heads
and
thick
glasses
of
black
and
men
from
the
and
golf
each
other
in
subdued
old
friends
from
university
recognized
each
other
from
and
edged
together
and
in
between
what
seemed
to
be
most
of
pagford
in
their
and
most
clothes
the
air
with
quiet
conversations
faces
watching
and
waiting
tessa
wall
best
coat
which
was
of
grey
wool
was
cut
so
tightly
around
the
that
she
could
not
raise
her
arms
above
chest
height
standing
beside
her
son
on
one
side
of
the
church
path
she
was
sad
little
smiles
and
waves
with
while
continuing
to
argue
with
fats
through
lips
she
was
trying
not
to
move
too

said
tessa
in
her
pocket
don
know
his
number
by
heart
lied
fats
coldly
she
and
colin
had
eaten
dinner
without
fats
the
previous
evening
because
he
had
up
to
andrew
place
where
they
were
working
on
their
english
together
that
at
any
was
the
story
fats
had
given
his
mother
and
tessa
had
pretended
to
believe
it
it
her
too
well
to
have
fats
out
of
the
way
of
colin
at
least
he
was
wearing
the
new
suit
that
tessa
had
bought
for
him
in
yarvil
she
had
lost
her
temper
at
him
in
the
third
shop
because
he
had
looked
like
in
everything
he
had
tried
on
and
and
she
had
thought
that
he
was
doing
it
on
purpose
that
he
could
have
the
suit
with
sense
of
if
he
chose
said
tessa
pre
fats
was
not
speaking
but
colin
was
approaching
them
leading
the
jawandas
he
seemed
in
his
state
to
be
confusing
the
role
of
with
that
of
by
the
gates
people
parminder
looked
and
in
her
with
her
children
behind
her
vikram
in
his
dark
suit
looked
like
star
few
yards
from
the
church
doors
samantha
mollison
was
waiting
beside
her
husband
looking
up
at
the
bright
off
white
sky
and
on
all
the
wasted
sunshine
beating
down
on
top
of
the
high
ceiling
of
she
was
refusing
to
be
from
the
hard
path
no
matter
how
many
old
ladies
had
to
cool
their
in
the
grass
her
leather
high
heels
might
sink
into
the
soft
earth
and
become
dirty
and
when
them
miles
and
samantha
responded
but
they
were
not
speaking
to
each
other
they
had
had
row
the
previous
evening
few
people
had
asked
after
lexie
and
libby
who
usually
came
home
at
weekends
but
both
girls
were
staying
over
at
friends
houses
samantha
knew
that
miles
regretted
their
absence
he
loved
playing
in
public
perhaps
she
thought
with
most
of
fury
he
would
ask
her
and
the
girls
to
with
him
for
picture
on
his
election
she
would
enjoy
telling
him
what
she
thought
of
that
idea
she
could
tell
that
he
was
surprised
by
the
no
doubt
he
was
that
he
did
not
have
role
in
the
service
it
would
have
been
an
opportunity
to
begin
campaign
for
barry
seat
on
the
council
with
this
big
of
voters
samantha
made
mental
note
to
drop
to
the
missed
opportunity
when
suitable
occasion
gavin
called
miles
at
the
sight
of
familiar
fair
and
narrow
head
oh
hi
miles
hi
sam
gavin
new
black
tie
shone
against
his
white
shirt
there
were
bags
under
his
light
eyes
samantha
leaned
in
on
so
that
he
could
not
avoid
kissing
her
on
the
cheek
and
her
big
isn
it
gavin
said
gazing
around
gavin
miles
told
his
wife
in
precisely
the
way
that
he
would
have
announced
that
small
and
child
had
been
book
for
effort
in
truth
he
had
been
little
surprised
when
gavin
had
told
him
he
had
been
this
miles
had
vaguely
imagined
that
he
and
samantha
would
be
privileged
guests
by
certain
of
mystery
and
importance
having
been
at
the
it
might
have
been
nice
gesture
if
mary
or
somebody
close
to
mary
had
asked
him
miles
to
read
lesson
or
say
few
words
to
acknowledge
the
important
part
he
had
played
in
barry
final
moments
samantha
was
deliberately
that
gavin
had
been
out
you
and
barry
were
quite
close
weren
you
gav
gavin
nodded
he
felt
and
little
sick
he
had
had
very
bad
night
sleep
waking
in
the
early
hours
from
horrible
dreams
in
which
first
he
had
dropped
the
coffin
so
that
barry
body
spilt
out
onto
the
church
floor
and
he
had
missed
the
funeral
and
arrived
at
st
michael
and
all
saints
to
find
mary
alone
in
the
white
faced
and
furious
screaming
at
him
that
he
had
ruined
the
whole
thing
not
sure
where
ought
to
be
he
said
looking
around
ve
never
done
this
before
nothing
to
it
mate
said
miles
there
only
one
really
don
drop
anything
miles
laugh
oddly
with
his
deep
speaking
voice
neither
gavin
nor
samantha
smiled
colin
wall
out
of
the
mass
of
bodies
big
and
awkward
looking
with
his
high
forehead
he
always
made
samantha
think
of
gavin
he
said
there
you
are
think
we
should
probably
stand
out
on
the
pavement
they
ll
be
here
in
few
minutes
right
said
gavin
relieved
to
be
ordered
around
colin
said
miles
with
nod
yes
hello
said
colin
before
turning
away
and
forcing
his
way
back
through
the
mass
of
then
came
another
small
of
movement
and
samantha
heard
howard
loud
voice
excuse
me
so
sorry
trying
to
join
our
family
the
crowd
parted
to
avoid
his
belly
and
howard
was
revealed
immense
in
faced
overcoat
shirley
and
maureen
in
his
wake
shirley
neat
and
in
blue
maureen
as
in
hat
with
small
black
hello
hello
said
howard
kissing
samantha
firmly
on
both
cheeks
and
how
sammy
her
answer
was
swallowed
up
in
awkward
as
everybody
began
backwards
off
the
path
there
was
certain
for
position
nobody
wanted
to
their
claim
to
place
near
the
church
entrance
with
this
in
two
of
the
crowd
familiar
were
revealed
like
separate
along
the
break
samantha
spotted
the
jawandas
coffee
brown
faces
among
all
the
vikram
handsome
in
his
dark
suit
parminder
dressed
in
why
did
she
do
it
didn
she
know
she
was
playing
right
into
the
likes
of
howard
and
shirley
hands
and
beside
her
little
tessa
wall
in
grey
coat
which
was
at
the
mary
fairbrother
and
the
children
were
walking
slowly
up
the
path
to
the
church
mary
was
pale
and
appeared
pounds
could
she
have
lost
so
much
weight
in
six
days
she
was
holding
one
of
the
twins
hands
with
her
other
arm
around
the
shoulders
of
her
younger
son
and
the
eldest
fergus
behind
she
walked
with
her
eyes
fixed
straight
ahead
her
soft
mouth
tight
other
family
members
followed
mary
and
the
children
the
moved
over
the
threshold
and
was
swallowed
up
in
the
interior
of
the
church
everyone
else
moved
towards
the
doors
at
once
which
in
an
the
mollisons
found
themselves
together
with
the
jawandas
after
you
mr
jawanda
sir
after
you
boomed
howard
holding
out
an
arm
to
let
the
surgeon
walk
in
first
but
howard
made
sure
to
use
his
to
prevent
anybody
else
taking
over
him
and
followed
vikram
immediately
through
the
entrance
leaving
their
families
to
follow
on
blue
carpet
ran
the
length
of
the
aisle
of
st
michael
and
all
saints
golden
stars
on
the
ceiling
reflected
the
glow
of
the
hanging
lamps
the
stained
glass
windows
were
and
halfway
down
the
on
the
side
st
michael
himself
stared
down
from
the
largest
window
in
silver
sky
blue
out
of
his
shoulders
in
one
hand
he
held
in
the
other
pair
of
golden
foot
rested
on
the
back
of
who
was
dark
grey
in
colour
and
to
raise
himself
the
expression
was
howard
stopped
level
with
st
michael
and
indicated
that
his
party
should
file
into
the
on
the
left
vikram
turned
right
into
the
opposite
one
while
the
remaining
mollisons
and
maureen
past
him
into
the
howard
remained
planted
on
the
blue
carpet
and
addressed
parminder
as
she
passed
him
dreadful
this
barry
awful
shock
yes
she
said
him
always
think
those
look
are
they
he
added
at
her
she
did
not
answer
but
took
her
place
beside
jaswant
howard
sat
down
too
making
of
himself
at
the
end
of
the
that
would
seal
it
off
to
shirley
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
knees
and
her
hands
were
clasped
apparently
in
but
she
was
really
over
howard
and
parminder
little
exchange
about
the
shirley
belonged
to
of
pagford
that
quietly
the
fact
that
the
old
vicarage
which
had
been
built
long
ago
to
house
high
church
vicar
with
and
staff
was
now
home
to
family
of
shirley
had
never
quite
what
religion
the
jawandas
were
she
thought
that
if
she
and
howard
went
to
the
or
the
or
wherever
it
was
the
jawandas
they
would
doubtless
be
required
to
cover
their
heads
and
remove
their
shoes
and
who
knew
what
else
otherwise
there
would
be
yet
it
was
for
parminder
to
her
in
church
it
was
not
as
though
parminder
did
not
have
normal
clothes
for
she
wore
them
to
work
every
day
the
double
standard
of
it
all
was
what
not
thought
for
the
it
showed
to
their
religion
and
by
to
barry
fairbrother
himself
of
whom
she
was
supposed
to
have
been
so
fond
shirley
her
hands
raised
her
head
and
gave
her
attention
over
to
the
of
people
who
were
passing
and
of
the
size
and
number
of
barry
some
of
these
had
been
heaped
up
against
the
shirley
spotted
the
offering
from
the
council
for
which
she
and
howard
had
the
collection
it
was
large
round
of
white
and
blue
flowers
which
were
the
colours
of
pagford
arms
their
flowers
and
all
the
other
were
by
the
life
sized
made
of
which
the
girls
rowing
team
had
given
sukhvinder
turned
in
her
to
look
for
whose
mother
had
made
the
she
wanted
to
that
she
had
seen
it
and
liked
it
but
the
crowd
was
and
she
could
not
spot
anywhere
sukhvinder
was
proud
that
they
had
done
it
especially
when
she
saw
that
people
were
pointing
it
out
to
each
other
as
they
settled
themselves
in
their
seats
five
of
the
eight
girls
on
the
team
had
up
money
for
the
had
told
sukhvinder
how
she
had
down
krystal
weedon
at
lunchtime
and
exposed
herself
to
the
piss
taking
of
krystal
friends
who
were
sitting
smoking
on
low
wall
by
the
newsagent
had
asked
krystal
if
she
wanted
to
in
yeah
will
all
righ
krystal
had
said
but
she
had
not
so
her
name
was
not
on
the
card
nor
as
far
as
sukhvinder
could
see
had
krystal
come
to
the
funeral
sukhvinder
insides
were
like
lead
but
the
ache
of
her
left
with
the
sharp
of
pain
when
she
moved
it
was
counter
and
at
least
fats
wall
in
his
black
suit
was
nowhere
near
her
he
had
not
made
eye
contact
with
her
when
their
two
families
had
met
briefly
in
the
he
was
by
the
presence
of
their
parents
as
he
was
sometimes
by
the
presence
of
andrew
price
late
the
previous
evening
her
anonymous
had
sent
her
black
and
white
picture
of
naked
victorian
child
covered
in
soft
dark
hair
she
had
seen
it
and
it
while
dressing
for
the
funeral
when
had
she
last
been
happy
she
knew
that
in
different
life
long
before
anyone
had
at
her
she
had
sat
in
this
church
and
been
quite
content
for
years
she
had
with
at
christmas
and
she
had
always
liked
st
michael
with
his
pretty
feminine
pre
face
his
golden
hair
but
this
morning
for
the
first
time
she
saw
him
differently
with
his
foot
almost
casually
on
that
dark
she
found
his
expression
and
the
were
packed
muffled
footsteps
and
quiet
the
dusty
air
as
the
ones
continued
to
file
in
at
the
back
of
the
church
and
took
up
standing
room
along
the
left
hand
wall
some
hopeful
down
the
aisle
in
case
of
an
overlooked
place
in
the
crammed
howard
remained
and
firm
until
shirley
his
shoulder
and
whispered
aubrey
and
julia
at
which
howard
turned
and
the
service
sheet
to
attract
the
fawleys
attention
they
came
briskly
down
the
aisle
aubrey
tall
thin
and
in
his
dark
suit
julia
with
her
light
red
hair
pulled
back
into
they
smiled
their
thanks
as
howard
moved
along
the
others
up
making
sure
that
the
fawleys
had
plenty
of
room
samantha
was
so
tightly
between
miles
and
maureen
that
she
could
feel
maureen
sharp
joint
pressing
into
her
flesh
on
one
side
and
the
keys
in
miles
pocket
on
the
other
furious
she
attempted
to
secure
herself
or
so
more
room
but
neither
miles
nor
maureen
had
anywhere
else
to
go
so
she
stared
straight
ahead
and
turned
her
thoughts
to
vikram
who
had
lost
none
of
his
appeal
in
the
month
or
so
since
she
had
last
seen
him
he
was
so
good
looking
it
was
silly
it
made
you
want
to
laugh
with
his
long
legs
and
his
broad
shoulders
and
the
of
his
belly
where
his
shirt
tucked
into
his
trousers
and
those
dark
eyes
with
the
thick
black
he
looked
like
god
compared
to
other
pagford
men
who
were
so
slack
and
and
as
miles
leaned
forward
to
exchange
whispered
with
julia
fawley
his
keys
ground
painfully
into
samantha
upper
thigh
and
she
imagined
vikram
open
the
dress
she
was
wearing
and
in
her
fantasy
she
had
to
put
on
the
matching
that
concealed
her
deep
of
the
and
silence
fell
except
for
soft
heads
turned
the
coffin
was
coming
up
the
aisle
the
were
almost
barry
brothers
were
both
five
foot
six
and
colin
wall
at
the
rear
six
foot
two
so
that
the
back
end
of
the
coffin
was
higher
than
the
front
the
coffin
itself
was
not
made
of
polished
mahogany
but
of
it
bloody
thought
howard
outraged
looks
of
surprise
across
many
faces
as
the
box
passed
them
but
some
had
known
all
about
the
coffin
in
advance
mary
had
told
tessa
who
had
told
parminder
how
the
choice
of
material
had
been
made
by
fergus
barry
eldest
son
who
wanted
because
it
was
quick
growing
material
and
therefore
friendly
fergus
was
for
all
things
green
and
sound
parminder
liked
the
coffin
better
much
better
than
the
wooden
box
in
which
most
english
of
their
dead
her
grandmother
had
always
had
fear
of
the
soul
being
trapped
inside
something
heavy
and
solid
the
way
that
down
the
the
lowered
the
coffin
onto
the
draped
and
barry
son
brothers
and
brother
in
law
edged
into
the
front
and
colin
walked
back
to
join
his
family
for
two
seconds
gavin
parminder
could
tell
that
he
was
unsure
of
where
to
go
his
only
option
to
walk
back
down
the
aisle
under
the
eyes
of
three
hundred
people
but
mary
must
have
made
sign
to
him
because
he
furiously
into
the
front
beside
barry
mother
parminder
had
only
ever
spoken
to
gavin
when
she
had
tested
and
treated
him
for
he
had
never
met
her
gaze
again
am
the
and
the
life
the
he
that
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
and
in
me
shall
never
die
the
vicar
did
not
sound
as
if
he
were
thinking
