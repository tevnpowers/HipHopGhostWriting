well
know
barry
was
very
but
it
would
be
huge
commitment
colin
and
it
not
as
though
parminder
gone
she
still
there
and
she
ll
still
be
trying
to
do
everything
barry
wanted
should
have
phoned
parminder
thought
tessa
as
she
said
it
with
guilty
in
her
stomach
oh
god
why
didn
think
to
call
parminder
but
she
ll
need
support
she
ll
never
be
able
to
stand
up
to
them
all
on
her
own
said
colin
and
howard
mollison
will
be
up
some
to
replace
barry
right
now
he
probably
already
oh
colin
bet
he
has
you
know
what
he
like
the
papers
in
colin
lap
fell
in
smooth
white
onto
the
floor
want
to
do
this
for
barry
ll
take
over
where
he
left
off
ll
make
sure
everything
he
worked
for
doesn
go
up
in
smoke
know
the
arguments
he
always
said
he
got
he
never
have
had
otherwise
and
look
how
much
he
gave
back
to
the
community
definitely
going
to
stand
going
to
look
into
what
ve
got
to
do
tomorrow
all
right
said
tessa
years
of
experience
had
taught
her
that
colin
ought
not
to
be
opposed
in
the
first
of
his
enthusiasm
or
it
would
simply
him
in
his
determination
to
those
same
years
had
taught
colin
that
tessa
often
pretended
to
agree
before
raising
these
of
were
always
with
their
mutual
of
that
long
buried
secret
tessa
felt
that
she
owed
him
he
felt
that
he
was
owed
this
is
something
really
want
to
do
tessa
understand
that
colin
she
pulled
herself
out
of
the
chair
wondering
whether
she
would
have
the
energy
to
get
upstairs
are
you
coming
to
bed
in
minute
want
to
finish
looking
through
these
first
he
was
up
the
printed
sheets
he
had
let
fall
his
new
seemed
to
be
giving
him
energy
tessa
slowly
in
their
bedroom
seemed
to
have
become
more
powerful
it
was
such
an
effort
to
lift
her
to
force
her
to
do
as
she
wished
she
pulled
on
her
dressing
gown
and
went
into
the
bathroom
where
she
could
hear
fats
moving
around
she
often
felt
lonely
and
drained
these
days
between
her
husband
and
son
who
seemed
to
exist
entirely
as
alien
to
each
other
as
landlord
and
tessa
went
to
take
off
her
then
realized
that
she
had
it
yesterday
so
tired
she
kept
losing
things
and
how
could
she
have
forgotten
to
call
parminder
worried
and
tense
she
off
to
bed
wednesday
krystal
weedon
had
spent
monday
and
tuesday
nights
on
her
friend
nikki
bedroom
floor
after
an
especially
bad
fight
with
her
mother
this
had
started
when
krystal
arrived
home
from
hanging
out
with
her
mates
at
the
and
found
terri
talking
to
obbo
on
the
everyone
in
the
fields
knew
obbo
with
his
puffy
face
and
his
gap

wha
she
krystal
had
demanded
robbie
scrambled
out
from
between
terri
legs
to
tightly
to
krystal
knees
robbie
did
not
like
men
coming
to
the
house
he
had
good
reason
nuthin
don
krystal
had
said
to
terri
she
did
not
want
her
mother
to
have
spare
cash
she
would
not
have
put
it
past
obbo
to
cut
out
the
middle
step
and
pay
her
for
the
favour
with
bag
of
smack
don

but
terri
had
said
yes

her
mother
had
said
yes
to
everything
and
everyone
forever
yeah
all
righ
go
on
then
ere
yeh
go
no
problem
krystal
had
gone
to
hang
out
at
the
under
sky
with
her
friends
she
felt
strained
and
she
could
not
seem
to
grasp
the
fact
of
mr
fairbrother
death
but
kept
to
the
stomach
that
made
her
want
to
out
at
somebody
she
was
also
and
guilty
about
having
stolen
tessa
wall
watch
but
why
had
the
silly
bitch
put
it
there
in
front
of
krystal
and
closed
her
eyes
what
did
she
expect
being
with
the
others
did
not
help
kept
her
about
fats
wall
finally
krystal
and
at
her
nikki
and
leanne
had
to
hold
krystal
back
so
krystal
home
to
find
that
obbo
computers
had
arrived
robbie
was
trying
to
climb
the
boxes
in
the
front
room
while
terri
sat
there
in
her
works
lying
out
on
the
floor
as
krystal
had
feared
obbo
had
paid
terri
with
bag
of
heroin
you
stupid
fuckin
bitch
they
ll
kick
yer
the
fuckin
clinic
again
but
heroin
took
krystal
mother
where
she
was
beyond
reach
though
she
responded
by
calling
krystal
little
bitch
and
whore
it
was
with
vacant
krystal
slapped
terri
across
the
face
terri
told
her
to
fuck
off
and
die
you
fuckin
look
after
him
fer
fuckin
change
then
you
useless
fuckin
cow
krystal
screamed
robbie
ran
up
the
hall
after
her
but
she
slammed
the
front
door
on
him
krystal
liked
nikki
house
better
than
any
other
it
was
not
as
tidy
as
her
nana
cath
but
it
was
loud
and
busy
nikki
had
two
brothers
and
sister
so
krystal
slept
on
folded
up
duvet
between
the
sisters
beds
the
walls
were
covered
with
pictures
cut
out
of
magazines
arranged
as
of
boys
and
beautiful
girls
it
had
never
occurred
to
krystal
to
her
own
bedroom
walls
but
guilt
was
at
her
insides
she
kept
remembering
robbie
terrified
face
as
she
slammed
the
door
on
him
so
on
wednesday
morning
she
came
home
in
any
case
nikki
family
was
not
keen
on
her
staying
more
than
two
nights
in
row
nikki
had
once
told
her
with
that
it
was
all
right
with
her
mum
if
it
didn
happen
too
often
but
that
krystal
was
to
stop
using
them
as
and
especially
to
stop
turning
up
past
midnight
terri
seemed
as
glad
as
she
ever
was
to
see
krystal
back
she
talked
about
the
new
social
worker
visit
and
krystal
wondered
what
the
stranger
had
thought
of
the
house
which
lately
had
even
further
below
its
usual
filthy
krystal
was
especially
worried
that
kay
had
found
robbie
at
home
when
he
ought
to
have
been
at
nursery
because
terri
commitment
to
keeping
robbie
in
pre
school
which
he
had
begun
while
with
his
foster
mother
had
been
key
condition
of
his
return
to
the
family
home
the
previous
year
she
was
also
furious
that
the
social
worker
had
caught
robbie
wearing
after
all
the
work
krystal
had
put
in
to
persuade
him
to
use
the
toilet
so
she
say
krystal
demanded
of
terri
me
she
wuz
gonna
come
back
said
terri
krystal
had
bad
feeling
about
this
their
usual
social
worker
seemed
content
to
let
the
weedon
family
get
along
without
much
interference
vague
and
often
getting
their
names
wrong
and
confusing
their
circumstances
with
those
of
other
clients
she
turned
up
every
two
weeks
with
no
apparent
except
to
check
that
robbie
was
still
alive
the
new
krystal
mood
when
straight
terri
was
by
her
daughter
anger
and
let
krystal
boss
her
around
making
the
most
of
her
temporary
authority
krystal
ordered
terri
to
put
on
some
proper
clothes
forced
robbie
back
into
clean
pants
reminded
him
he
couldn
piss
in
this
kind
and
marched
him
off
to
nursery
he
when
she
made
to
leave
at
first
she
got
with
him
but
finally
she
down
and
promised
him
that
she
would
come
back
and
pick
him
up
at
one
and
he
let
her
go
then
krystal
even
though
wednesday
was
the
day
she
liked
best
at
school
because
she
had
both
and
guidance
and
set
to
work
to
clean
up
the
house
bit
pine
over
the
kitchen
all
the
old
food
and
cigarette
into
bin
she
hid
the
biscuit
tin
holding
terri
works
and
heaved
the
remaining
computers
three
had
already
been
collected
into
the
hall
cupboard
all
the
time
she
was
food
off
the
plates
krystal
thoughts
kept
returning
to
the
rowing
team
she
would
have
had
training
the
following
night
if
mr
fairbrother
had
still
been
alive
he
usually
gave
her
lift
both
ways
in
the
people
carrier
because
she
had
no
other
means
of
getting
over
to
the
canal
in
yarvil
his
twin
daughters
niamh
and
siobhan
and
sukhvinder
jawanda
came
in
the
car
too
krystal
had
no
regular
contact
with
these
three
girls
during
school
hours
but
since
becoming
team
they
had
always
said
all
right
when
they
passed
each
other
in
the
corridors
krystal
had
expected
them
to
look
down
their
at
her
but
they
were
ok
once
you
got
to
know
them
they
laughed
at
her
jokes
they
had
adopted
some
of
her
favourite
phrases
she
was
in
some
sense
the
nobody
in
krystal
family
had
ever
owned
car
if
she
concentrated
she
could
smell
the
interior
of
the
people
carrier
even
over
the
stink
of
terri
kitchen
she
loved
its
warm
she
would
never
be
in
that
car
again
there
had
been
on
bus
too
with
mr
fairbrother
driving
the
whole
team
and
sometimes
they
had
stayed
overnight
when
they
against
far
flung
schools
the
team
had
in
the
back
of
the
bus
it
had
become
their
lucky
ritual
their
with
krystal
doing
at
the
start
mr
fairbrother
had
nearly
pissed
himself
the
first
time
he
heard
her
do
it
good
girl
gone
bad
take
three
action
no
in
my
let
it
rain
into
comin
down
with
the
krystal
had
never
understood
the
words
cubby
wall
had
sent
round
letter
to
them
all
saying
that
the
team
would
not
be
meeting
until
they
could
find
new
but
they
would
never
find
new
so
that
was
pile
of
shit
they
all
knew
that
it
had
been
mr
fairbrother
team
his
krystal
had
taken
of
from
nikki
and
the
others
for
their
had
hidden
and
later
on
admiration
because
the
team
had
won
krystal
kept
hers
in
box
she
had
stolen
from
nikki
house
krystal
was
much
given
to
things
into
her
pockets
that
belonged
to
people
she
liked
this
box
was
plastic
and
decorated
with
child
jewellery
box
really
tessa
watch
was
curled
up
inside
it
now
the
best
time
of
all
had
been
when
they
beaten
those
little
from
st
anne
that
day
had
been
the
very
best
of
krystal
life
the
headmistress
had
called
the
team
up
in
front
of
the
whole
school
at
the
next
assembly
krystal
had
been
bit
nikki
and
leanne
had
been
laughing
at
her
but
then
everyone
had
them
it
had
meant
something
that
winterdown
had
st
anne
but
it
was
all
finished
all
over
the
in
the
car
and
the
rowing
and
the
talking
to
the
local
newspaper
she
had
liked
the
idea
of
being
in
the
newspaper
again
mr
fairbrother
had
said
he
was
going
to
be
there
with
her
when
it
happened
just
the
two
of
them
what
will
they
wanna
talk
to
me
like
your
life
they
re
interested
in
your
life
like
krystal
had
no
money
for
magazines
but
she
saw
them
in
nikki
house
and
at
the
doctor
if
she
took
robbie
this
would
have
been
even
better
than
being
in
the
paper
with
the
team
she
had
burst
with
excitement
at
the
prospect
but
somehow
she
had
managed
to
keep
her
mouth
shut
and
had
not
even
about
it
to
nikki
or
leanne
she
had
wanted
to
surprise
them
it
was
as
well
she
had
not
said
anything
she
would
never
be
in
the
paper
again
there
was
in
krystal
stomach
she
tried
not
to
think
any
more
about
mr
fairbrother
as
she
moved
around
the
house
cleaning
but
while
her
mother
sat
in
the
kitchen
smoking
and
staring
out
of
the
back
window
shortly
before
midday
woman
pulled
up
outside
the
house
in
an
old
blue
krystal
caught
sight
of
her
from
robbie
bedroom
window
the
visitor
had
very
short
dark
hair
and
was
wearing
black
trousers
sort
of
and
carrying
large
bag
over
her
shoulder
that
seemed
to
be
full
of
files
krystal
ran
downstairs

er
she
called
to
terri
who
was
in
the
kitchen

new

and
most
of
the
stuff
that

crammed
onto

could
feed
her
and
robbie

up

violently
off

from

to

warm
liquid
flowing
down

and
thought
of

merely
snatched

last
cigarette
and
lighter
and
lit
up
on
the
cigarette
she
walked
away
from

turned
her
back
trying
to
press
away
more
tears
before
they
fell

she
sat
down
again
and
lifted
the
heavy
folder
back
onto
her
lap
from
the
floor
where
it
had
fallen
when
robbie
came
back
to
you
last

terri
you
were
off
the
heroin
you
made
big
commitment
to
staying
clean

certain
other
things
like

from
her

ain
after
im
all
righ
she
at
kay
pink
in
the
face
her
heavily
eyes
with
tears
of
anger
finger
at
her
own
chest
krystal
had
visited
robbie
regularly
at
his
foster
parents
during
the

he
had
been
away
from
them
he
had
clung
to
her
wanted
her

cried
when

been
like
having
half
your
guts

nana
cath
the

missing
teeth
terri
gaze

vacant

think

show
your
commitment

terri

asked
krystal
she

bigger
bitch
even
than
that
foster
mother
with
her
kitchen
and
the
way

of

shirley
mollison
spent
at
south
west
general
in
yarvil
here
she
and
fellow
performed
non
medical
jobs
such
as
pushing
the
library
around
the
beds
looking
after
patients
flowers
and
making
to
the
shop
in
the
for
those
who
were
bed
and
without
visitors
shirley
favourite
was
going
from
bed
to
bed
taking
orders
for
meals
once
carrying
her
and
wearing
her
pass
she
had
been
mistaken
by
passing
doctor
for
hospital
administrator
the
idea
of
had
come
to
shirley
during
her
ever
conversation
with
julia
fawley
during
one
of
the
wonderful
christmas
parties
at
sweetlove
house
here
she
had
learned
that
julia
was
involved
in
raising
for
the
wing
of
the
local
hospital
what
we
really
need
is
visit
julia
had
said
her
eyes
to
the
door
over
shirley
shoulder
going
to
get
aubrey
to
have
quiet
word
with
excuse
me
must
say
hello
to
shirley
was
left
standing
there
beside
the
saying
oh
of
course
of
course
to
thin
air
she
had
no
idea
who
was
but
she
felt
quite
light
headed
the
very
next
day
without
even
telling
howard
what
she
was
up
to
she
telephoned
south
west
general
and
asked
about
work
that
nothing
was
required
but
character
sound
mind
and
strong
legs
she
had
demanded
an
form
work
had
opened
whole
new
glorious
world
to
shirley
this
was
the
dream
that
julia
fawley
had
handed
her
beside
the
that
of
herself
standing
with
her
hands
clasped
in
front
of
her
her
pass
around
her
neck
while
the
queen
moved
slowly
down
line
of
beaming
she
saw
herself
dropping
perfect
the
queen
attention
caught
she
stopped
to
chat
she
shirley
on
giving
her
free
time
and
photograph
and
the
newspapers
next
day
the
queen
to
hospital
mrs
shirley
mollison
sometimes
when
shirley
really
concentrated
on
this
scene
an
almost
holy
feeling
came
over
her
at
the
hospital
had
given
shirley
glittering
new
weapon
with
which
to
down
maureen
when
widow
had
been
transformed
like
from
shop
girl
to
business
partner
she
had
taken
on
that
shirley
though
it
all
with
smile
found
but
shirley
had
the
higher
ground
she
worked
not
for
profit
but
out
of
the
of
her
heart
it
was
to
it
was
what
women
did
who
had
no
need
of
extra
cash
women
like
herself
and
julia
fawley
what
was
more
the
hospital
gave
shirley
access
to
mine
of
gossip
to
out
maureen
tedious
about
the
new
café
this
morning
shirley
stated
her
for
twenty
eight
in
firm
voice
to
the
and
was
sent
off
to
the
department
she
had
made
her
only
friend
among
the
nursing
staff
on
twenty
eight
some
of
the
young
nurses
could
be
and
patronizing
to
the
but
ruth
price
who
had
recently
returned
to
nursing
after
break
of
sixteen
years
had
been
from
the
first
they
were
both
as
shirley
put
it
pagford
women
which
made
though
as
it
happened
shirley
was
not
pagford
born
she
and
her
younger
sister
had
grown
up
with
their
mother
in
and
untidy
flat
in
yarvil
shirley
mother
had
drunk
lot
she
had
never
divorced
the
girls
father
whom
they
did
not
see
local
men
had
all
seemed
to
know
shirley
mother
name
and
when
they
said
it
but
that
was
long
time
ago
and
shirley
took
the
view
that
the
past
if
you
never
mentioned
it
she
refused
to
remember
shirley
and
ruth
greeted
each
other
with
delight
but
it
was
busy
morning
and
there
was
no
time
for
anything
but
the
most
exchange
about
barry
fairbrother
sudden
death
they
agreed
to
meet
for
lunch
at
half
past
twelve
and
shirley
strode
off
to
fetch
the
library
she
was
in
wonderful
mood
she
could
see
the
future
as
clearly
as
if
it
had
already
happened
howard
miles
and
aubrey
fawley
were
going
to
to
cut
the
fields
for
ever
and
this
would
be
the
occasion
for
dinner
at
sweetlove
house
shirley
found
the
place
the
enormous
garden
with
its
its
hedges
and
its
the
wide
panelled
hallway
the
silver
framed
photograph
on
the
showing
the
owner
joke
with
the
she
detected
no
in
the
fawleys
attitude
towards
her
or
her
husband
but
then
there
were
so
many
for
her
attention
whenever
she
came
within
the
fawleys
she
could
just
imagine
the
five
of
them
sitting
down
to
private
dinner
in
one
of
those
delicious
little
side
rooms
howard
sitting
next
to
julia
she
on
aubrey
right
hand
and
miles
in
between
them
in
shirley
fantasy
samantha
was
shirley
and
ruth
found
each
other
by
the
at
half
past
twelve
the
hospital
was
not
yet
as
crowded
as
it
would
be
by
one
and
the
nurse
and
the
found
without
too
much
difficulty
strewn
table
for
two
against
the
wall
how
simon
how
are
the
boys
asked
shirley
when
ruth
had
wiped
down
the
table
and
they
had
the
contents
of
their
trays
and
sat
facing
each
other
ready
for
chat
si
fine
thanks
fine
bringing
home
our
new
computer
today
the
boys
can
wait
you
can
imagine
this
was
quite
andrew
and
paul
both
possessed
cheap
the
pc
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
tiny
sitting
room
and
neither
boy
touched
it
to
do
nothing
that
took
them
within
the
of
their
father
ruth
often
spoke
of
her
sons
to
shirley
as
though
they
were
much
younger
than
they
were
easily
amused
perhaps
she
sought
to
make
herself
younger
to
the
age
difference
between
herself
and
shirley
which
stood
at
nearly
two
to
make
them
even
more
like
mother
and
daughter
ruth
mother
had
died
ten
years
previously
she
missed
having
an
older
woman
in
her
life
and
shirley
relationship
with
her
own
daughter
was
she
had
to
ruth
not
all
it
could
have
been
miles
and
have
always
been
very
close
patricia
though
she
was
always
rather
difficult
character
she
up
in
london
now
ruth
longed
to
but
quality
that
she
and
shirley
shared
and
admired
in
each
other
was
pride
in
an
surface
to
the
world
ruth
laid
her
curiosity
aside
therefore
though
not
without
private
hope
that
she
would
find
out
in
due
course
what
made
patricia
so
difficult
shirley
and
ruth
instant
liking
for
each
other
had
been
in
their
mutual
recognition
that
the
other
was
woman
like
herself
woman
whose
pride
lay
in
having
and
retained
the
affection
of
her
husband
like
they
shared
code
and
were
therefore
secure
in
each
other
company
in
way
that
they
were
not
with
other
women
their
was
still
more
for
being
by
sense
of
because
each
the
other
for
her
choice
of
husband
to
ruth
howard
was
physically
grotesque
and
she
was
puzzled
to
understand
how
her
friend
who
retained
plump
yet
delicate
could
ever
have
agreed
to
marry
him
to
shirley
who
could
not
remember
ever
setting
eyes
on
simon
who
had
never
heard
him
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
higher
of
pagford
and
who
understood
ruth
to
lack
even
social
life
ruth
husband
sounded
inadequate
so
saw
miles
and
samantha
bringing
barry
in
ruth
said
into
the
main
subject
without
she
had
much
less
than
shirley
finding
it
difficult
to
her
for
pagford
gossip
of
which
she
was
stuck
high
on
the
hill
above
town
by
simon
did
they
actually
see
it
happen
oh
yes
said
shirley
they
were
having
dinner
at
the
golf
club
sunday
night
you
know
the
girls
were
back
at
school
and
sam
eating
out
she
not
much
of
cook
bit
by
bit
over
their
shared
coffee
ruth
had
learned
some
of
the
inside
story
of
miles
and
samantha
marriage
shirley
had
told
her
how
her
son
had
been
to
marry
samantha
because
samantha
had
fallen
pregnant
with
lexie
they
ve
made
the
best
of
it
shirley
sighed
brightly
miles
did
the
right
thing
wouldn
have
had
it
any
other
way
the
girls
are
lovely
it
pity
miles
didn
have
son
he
would
have
been
wonderful
with
boy
but
sam
didn
want
third
ruth
up
every
criticism
shirley
made
of
her
daughter
in
law
she
had
taken
an
immediate
dislike
to
samantha
years
before
when
she
had
accompanied
four
year
old
andrew
to
the
nursery
class
at
st
thomas
and
there
met
samantha
and
her
daughter
lexie
with
her
loud
laugh
and
her
and
fine
line
in
jokes
for
the
mothers
samantha
had
struck
ruth
as
for
years
ruth
had
watched
as
samantha
stuck
out
her
massive
chest
while
talking
to
vikram
jawanda
at
parents
evenings
and
simon
around
the
edge
of
to
avoid
having
to
talk
to
her
shirley
was
still
the
second
hand
of
barry
final
journey
giving
all
possible
weight
to
miles
quick
thinking
in
calling
the
ambulance
to
his
support
of
mary
fairbrother
to
his
on
remaining
with
her
at
the
hospital
until
the
walls
arrived
ruth
listened
though
with
slight
impatience
shirley
was
much
more
when
she
was
the
of
samantha
than
when
the
of
miles
what
was
more
ruth
was
with
something
that
she
wished
to
tell
shirley
so
there
an
empty
seat
on
the
parish
council
ruth
said
the
moment
that
shirley
reached
the
point
in
the
story
where
miles
and
samantha
the
stage
to
colin
and
tessa
wall
we
call
it
casual
vacancy
said
shirley
kindly
ruth
took
deep
breath
simon
she
said
excited
at
the
mere
telling
of
it
is
thinking
of
standing
shirley
smiled
automatically
raised
her
eyebrows
in
polite
surprise
and
took
of
tea
to
hide
her
face
ruth
was
completely
that
she
had
said
anything
to
her
friend
she
had
assumed
that
shirley
would
be
delighted
to
think
of
their
sitting
on
the
parish
council
together
and
had
vague
that
shirley
might
be
helpful
in
bringing
this
about
he
told
me
last
night
ruth
went
on
he
been
thinking
about
it
for
while
certain
other
things
that
simon
had
said
about
the
possibility
of
taking
over
from
to
keep
them
on
as
council
ruth
had
pushed
out
of
her
mind
as
she
pushed
out
all
of
simon
little
his
petty
had
no
idea
simon
was
interested
in
getting
involved
in
local
government
said
shirley
her
tone
light
and
pleasant
oh
yes
said
ruth
who
had
had
no
idea
either
he
very
keen
has
he
been
talking
to
dr
jawanda
asked
shirley
her
tea
again
did
she
suggest
standing
to
him
ruth
was
thrown
by
this
and
her
genuine
showed
no
simon
hasn
been
to
the
doctor
in
ages
mean
he
very
healthy
shirley
smiled
if
he
was
acting
alone
without
the
support
of
the
jawanda
then
the
threat
posed
by
simon
was
surely
she
even
ruth
who
was
in
for
nasty
surprise
she
shirley
who
knew
everybody
who
counted
in
pagford
would
have
been
hard
pressed
to
recognize
ruth
husband
if
he
came
into
the
delicatessen
who
on
earth
did
poor
ruth
think
would
vote
for
him
on
the
other
hand
shirley
knew
that
there
was
one
question
that
howard
and
aubrey
would
want
her
to
ask
as
matter
of
routine
simon
always
lived
in
pagford
hasn
he
no
he
was
born
in
the
fields
said
ruth
ah
said
shirley
she
back
the
lid
of
her
picked
up
her
spoon
and
took
mouthful
the
fact
that
simon
was
likely
to
have
pro
fields
was
whatever
his
worth
knowing
will
it
be
on
the
website
how
you
put
your
name
forward
ruth
asked
still
hoping
for
late
of
and
enthusiasm
oh
yes
said
shirley
vaguely
expect
so
iii
andrew
fats
and
twenty
seven
others
spent
the
last
period
on
wednesday
afternoon
in
what
fats
called
this
was
the
second
from
bottom
maths
set
taken
by
the
department
most
teacher
faced
young
woman
fresh
from
teacher
training
who
was
of
keeping
good
order
and
who
often
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
tears
fats
who
had
set
himself
on
course
of
determined
over
the
previous
year
had
been
to
from
the
top
set
andrew
who
had
struggled
with
numbers
all
his
life
lived
in
fear
that
he
would
be
to
the
very
bottom
set
along
with
krystal
weedon
and
her
cousin
dane
tully
andrew
and
fats
sat
at
the
back
of
the
room
together
occasionally
when
he
had
tired
of
the
class
or
it
into
further
fats
would
show
andrew
how
to
do
sum
the
level
of
noise
was
miss
shouted
over
the
top
of
them
all
for
quiet
were
by
people
got
up
constantly
to
visit
each
other
desks
their
chair
legs
across
the
floor
small
across
the
room
whenever
miss
looked
away
sometimes
fats
made
excuses
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
cubby
up
and
down
stiff
walk
fats
humour
was
at
its
here
in
english
where
he
and
andrew
were
both
in
the
top
set
he
did
not
bother
to
use
cubby
for
material
sukhvinder
jawanda
was
sitting
directly
in
front
of
andrew
long
ago
in
primary
school
andrew
fats
and
the
other
boys
had
pulled
sukhvinder
long
blue
black
it
was
the
thing
to
catch
hold
of
when
playing
and
it
had
once
presented
an
temptation
when
dangling
like
now
down
her
back
hidden
from
the
teacher
but
andrew
no
longer
had
any
desire
to
it
nor
to
touch
any
part
of
sukhvinder
she
was
one
of
the
few
girls
over
whom
his
eyes
without
the
slightest
interest
since
fats
had
pointed
it
out
he
had
noticed
the
soft
dark
down
on
her
upper
lip
sukhvinder
older
sister
jaswant
had
figure
tiny
waist
and
face
that
to
the
of
gaia
had
seemed
beautiful
to
andrew
with
its
high
cheekbones
smooth
golden
skin
and
shaped
liquid
brown
eyes
naturally
jaswant
had
always
been
completely
beyond
his
reach
two
years
older
and
the
girl
in
the
sixth
form
with
an
of
being
aware
to
the
last
hard
on
of
her
own
sukhvinder
was
the
only
person
in
the
room
who
was
making
absolutely
no
noise
with
her
back
and
her
head
bent
low
over
her
work
she
appeared
to
be
in
concentration
she
had
pulled
the
left
sleeve
of
her
down
so
that
it
completely
covered
her
hand
the
to
make
fist
her
total
stillness
was
almost
the
great
quiet
and
still
murmured
fats
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
back
of
sukhvinder
head
yet
large
remain
by
the
of
the
man
woman
andrew
yet
he
was
not
entirely
at
his
ease
he
would
have
enjoyed
himself
more
if
he
knew
that
sukhvinder
could
not
hear
what
fats
was
saying
the
last
time
that
he
had
been
over
at
fats
house
fats
had
shown
him
the
messages
he
was
sending
regularly
to
sukhvinder
facebook
page
he
had
been
the
internet
for
information
and
pictures
about
and
was
sending
or
an
image
day
it
was
sort
of
funny
but
it
made
andrew
uncomfortable
speaking
sukhvinder
was
not
asking
for
it
she
seemed
very
easy
andrew
liked
it
best
when
fats
directed
his
tongue
towards
figures
of
authority
the
or
the
self
satisfied
separated
from
its
bearded
bra
wearing
said
fats
it
lost
in
thought
wondering
whether
it
would
suit
andrew
laughed
then
felt
guilty
but
fats
lost
interest
and
turned
his
attention
to
every
on
his
into
puckered
andrew
to
trying
to
guess
where
the
point
should
go
and
contemplating
the
prospect
of
the
school
bus
home
and
gaia
it
was
always
much
more
difficult
to
find
seat
where
he
might
keep
her
in
his
eye
line
on
the
school
to
home
trip
because
she
was
frequently
in
before
he
got
there
or
too
far
away
their
shared
amusement
in
monday
morning
assembly
had
led
nowhere
she
had
not
made
eye
contact
with
him
on
the
bus
either
morning
since
nor
in
any
other
way
that
she
knew
he
in
the
four
weeks
of
his
andrew
had
never
actually
spoken
to
gaia
he
attempted
to
opening
lines
while
the
din
of
crashed
around
him
that
was
funny
monday
in
assembly
sukhvinder
are
you
all
right
miss
who
had
bent
down
over
sukhvinder
work
to
mark
it
was
into
the
girl
face
andrew
watched
sukhvinder
nod
and
draw
in
her
hands
her
face
still
up
over
her
work
stage
whispered
from
two
rows
in
front
peanut
he
was
trying
to
draw
their
attention
to
what
they
already
knew
that
sukhvinder
by
the
gentle
of
her
shoulders
was
crying
and
that
miss
was
making
hopeless
attempts
to
find
out
what
was
wrong
the
class
further
in
their
teacher
louder
than
ever
peanut
andrew
could
never
decide
whether
irritated
or
accidentally
but
he
had
an
for
on
people
the
peanut
was
very
old
one
which
had
clung
to
andrew
in
primary
school
he
had
always
hated
it
fats
had
forced
the
name
out
of
by
never
using
it
fats
had
always
been
the
final
in
such
matters
was
even
getting
fats
name
wrong
had
enjoyed
only
brief
last
year
peanut
fuck
off
you
headed
said
fats
under
his
breath
was
hanging
over
the
back
of
his
seat
staring
at
sukhvinder
who
had
curled
over
her
face
almost
touching
the
desk
while
miss
beside
her
her
hands
to
touch
her
and
unable
to
any
explanation
for
her
distress
few
more
people
had
noticed
this
unusual
and
were
staring
but
at
the
front
of
the
room
several
boys
continued
to
oblivious
to
everything
but
their
own
amusement
one
of
them
seized
the
wood
backed
board
from
miss
desk
he
threw
it
the
soared
right
across
the
room
and
crashed
into
the
clock
on
the
back
wall
which
to
the
ground
and
shattered
of
plastic
and
metal
everywhere
and
several
girls
including
miss
shrieked
in
shock

door
of
the
open
and
with
off
the
wall
the
class
fell

standing
there
flushed
and
furious

and
back
again

around

poor
woman

himself
on
the
rear
legs
of
his
chair
his

challenging

front
of
the
room

at
this
supported
by
couple
of
the
girls
the
actual
of
the
of
whom
everybody
knew
miss
was
afraid
sat
at
their
desks
as
there
were
only
five
minutes
remaining
until
the
end
of
the
school
day
andrew
and
fats
set
about
out
the
clearing
up
until
they
would
be
able
to
it
unfinished
while
fats
further
by
and
stiff
doing
the
cubby
walk
sukhvinder
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
wool
covered
hand
and
sank
back
into
when
the
bell
rang
miss
made
no
attempt
to
control
or
contain
the
or
rush
for
the
door
andrew
and
fats
kicked
various
bits
of
clock
under
the
cupboards
at
the
back
of
the
room
and
swung
their
school
bags
over
their
shoulders
again
called
hurrying
to
catch
up
with
andrew
and
fats
as
they
headed
down
the
corridor
do

cubby
father
at
home
seriously
do
you
he
thought
he
had
something
on
fats
he
thought
he
had
got
him
you
re
said
fats
and
andrew
laughed
iv
dr
jawanda
running
about
fifteen
minutes
late
the
told
tessa
oh
that
fine
said
tessa
in
no
hurry
it
was
early
evening
and
the
waiting
room
windows
made
patches
of
clear
blue
against
the
walls
there
were
only
two
other
people
there
wheezing
old
woman
wearing
carpet
and
young
mother
who
was
reading
while
her
in
the
toy
box
in
the
corner
tessa
took
battered
old
heat
from
the
table
in
the
middle
sat
down
and
through
the
pages
looking
at
the
pictures
the
delay
gave
her
more
time
to
think
about
what
she
was
going
to
say
to
parminder
they
had
spoken
briefly
on
the
telephone
this
morning
tessa
had
been
full
of
that
she
had
not
called
at
once
to
let
parminder
know
about
barry
parminder
had
said
it
was
fine
for
tessa
not
to
be
silly
that
she
was
not
upset
at
all
but
tessa
with
her
experience
of
the
thin
skinned
and
fragile
could
tell
that
parminder
beneath
her
was
she
had
tried
to
explain
that
she
had
been
exhausted
the
last
couple
of
days
and
that
she
had
had
to
deal
with
mary
colin
fats
krystal
weedon
that
she
had
felt
lost
and
of
thinking
of
more
than
the
immediate
problems
that
had
been
thrown
at
her
but
parminder
had
cut
her
off
in
the
middle
of
her
excuses
and
said
calmly
that
she
would
see
her
later
at
the
surgery
dr
emerged
white
haired
and
from
his
room
gave
tessa
wave
and
said
the
young
mother
had
some
difficulty
in
her
daughter
to
the
old
toy
telephone
on
that
the
had
found
in
the
toy
box
while
being
pulled
gently
by
the
hand
after
dr
the
little
girl
gazed
over
her
shoulder
at
the
telephone
whose
secrets
she
would
never
now
discover
when
the
door
closed
on
them
tessa
realized
that
she
was
smiling
and
hastily
her
own
features
she
was
going
to
become
one
of
those
awful
old
ladies
who
over
small
children
and
frightened
them
she
would
have
loved
little
blonde
daughter
to
go
with
her
dark
boy
how
awful
it
was
thought
tessa
remembering
fats
the
the
way
tiny
of
your
living
children
your
heart
they
could
never
know
and
would
hate
it
if
they
did
how
their
growing
was
constant
parminder
door
opened
tessa
looked
up
mrs
weedon
said
parminder
her
eyes
met
tessa
and
she
gave
smile
that
was
no
smile
at
all
but
mere
of
the
mouth
the
little
old
lady
in
carpet
got
up
with
difficulty
and
away
around
the
wall
after
parminder
tessa
heard
parminder
surgery
door
shut
she
read
the
to
series
of
photographs
showing
wife
in
all
the
different
she
had
worn
over
the
previous
five
days
the
young
woman
long
thin
legs
tessa
wondered
how
different
her
life
would
have
been
if
she
had
had
legs
like
that
she
could
not
help
but
suspect
that
it
would
have
been
almost
entirely
different
tessa
legs
were
thick
shapeless
and
short
she
would
have
hidden
them
in
only
it
was
difficult
to
find
many
that
would
up
over
her
she
remembered
telling
little
girl
in
guidance
that
looks
did
not
matter
that
personality
was
much
more
important
what
rubbish
we
tell
children
thought
tessa
turning
the
page
of
her
an
out
of
sight
door
opened
with
somebody
was
shouting
in
cracked
voice

for
help
it
your
job
it
your
tessa
and
the
locked
eyes
then
turned
towards
the
sound
of
the
shouting
tessa
heard
parminder
voice
its
accent
still
after
all
these
years
in
pagford

towards

the

shut
behind
her
the
exchanged
another
look
with
tessa
they
heard
parminder
surgery
door
close
again
it
was
five
minutes
before
parminder

stared
at
her
screen

parminder
with
another
tight
non

said
parminder
fine
why
well
barry

what
he
meant
to
you
and
what
you
meant
to
him
tears
in
parminder
eyes
and
she
tried
to
them
away
but
too
late
tessa
had
seen
them
minda
she
said
laying
her
plump
hand
on
parminder
thin
one
but
parminder
it
away
as
if
tessa
had
her
then
betrayed
by
her
own
she
began
to
cry
in
unable
to
hide
in
the
tiny
room
though
she
had
turned
her
back
as
nearly
as
she
could
in
her
swivel
chair
felt
sick
when
realized
hadn
phoned
you
tessa
said
over
parminder
furious
attempts
to
her
own
sobs
wanted
to
up
and
die
meant
to
call
she
lied
but
we
hadn
slept
we
spent
almost
the
whole
night
at
the
hospital
then
we
had
to
go
straight
out
to
work
colin
broke
down
at
assembly
when
he
announced
it
then
he
caused
bloody
awful
scene
with
krystal
weedon
in
front
of
everyone
and
then
stuart
decided
to
play
and
mary
falling
apart
but
so
sorry
minda
should
ve
called
said
parminder
her
face
hidden
behind
she
had
pulled
out
from
her
sleeve
mary
most
important
you
would
have
been
one
of
the
very
first
people
barry
called
said
tessa
and
to
her
horror
she
burst
into
tears
too
minda
so
sorry
she
sobbed
but
was
having
to
deal
with
colin
and
all
the
rest
of
them
don
be
silly
said
parminder
as
she
dabbed
at
her
thin
face
we
re
being
silly
no
we
re
not
oh
let
go
for
once
parminder
but
the
doctor
her
thin
shoulders
blew
her
nose
and
sat
up
straight
again
did
vikram
tell
you
asked
tessa
handful
of
tissues
from
the
box
on
parminder
desk
no
said
parminder
howard
mollison
in
the
deli
oh
god
minda
so
sorry
don
be
silly
it
fine
crying
had
made
parminder
feel
slightly
better
towards
tessa
who
was
wiping
her
own
plain
kind
face
this
was
relief
for
now
that
barry
was
gone
tessa
was
parminder
only
real
friend
in
pagford
she
always
said
in
pagford
to
herself
pretending
that
somewhere
beyond
the
little
town
she
had
hundred
friends
she
never
quite
admitted
to
herself
that
these
only
of
the
memories
of
her
of
school
mates
back
in
from
whom
the
tide
of
life
had
long
since
separated
her
and
the
medical
colleagues
with
whom
she
had
studied
and
who
still
sent
christmas
cards
but
who
never
came
to
see
her
and
whom
she
never
visited
how
colin
tessa
oh
minda
oh
god
he
says
he
going
to
run
for
barry
seat
on
the
parish
council
the
pronounced
between
parminder
thick
dark
brows
can
you
imagine
colin
running
for
election
tessa
asked
her
sodden
tissues
crumpled
tightly
in
her
fist
with
the
likes
of
aubrey
fawley
and
howard
mollison
trying
to
fill
barry
shoes
telling
himself
he
got
to
win
the
for
barry
all
the
responsibility
colin
with
lot
of
responsibility
at
work
said
parminder
barely
said
tessa
without
thinking
she
felt
instantly
and
started
to
cry
again
it
was
so
strange
she
had
entered
the
surgery
thinking
that
she
would
offer
comfort
to
parminder
but
instead
here
she
was
pouring
out
her
own
instead
you
know
what
colin
like
he
takes
everything
to
heart
so
much
he
takes
everything
so
personally
he
very
well
you
know
all
things
considered
said
parminder
oh
know
he
does
said
tessa
the
fight
seemed
to
go
out
of
her
know
colin
was
almost
the
only
person
towards
whom
self
contained
parminder
showed
ready
in
return
colin
would
never
hear
word
against
her
he
was
her
in
pagford
an
excellent
gp
he
would
at
anyone
who
dared
to
her
in
his
hearing
best
ve
ever
had
parminder
did
not
have
many
she
was
with
the
pagford
old
guard
having
reputation
for
being
grudging
with
and
if
howard
mollison
gets
his
way
there
won
be
an
election
at
all
said
parminder
what
you
mean
he
sent
round
an
it
came
in
half
an
hour
ago
parminder
turned
to
her
computer
monitor
typed
in
and
brought
up
her
she
the
monitor
so
that
tessa
could
read
howard
message
the
first
paragraph
expressed
regret
at
barry
death
the
next
suggested
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
year
of
barry
term
had
already
co
replacement
might
be
preferable
to
going
through
the
process
of
full
election
he
lined
someone
up
already
said
parminder
he
trying
to
in
some
before
anyone
can
stop
him
wouldn
be
surprised
if
it
was
miles
oh
surely
not
said
tessa
instantly
miles
was
at
the
hospital
with
barry
no
he
was
very
upset
by
it
you
re
so
damn
naive
tessa
said
parminder
and
tessa
was
shocked
by
the
in
her
friend
voice
you
don
understand
what
howard
mollison
like
he
man
you
didn
hear
him
when
he
found
out
that
barry
had
written
to
the
paper
about
the
fields
you
don
know
what
he
trying
to
do
with
the
methadone
clinic
you
wait
you
ll
see
her
hand
was
trembling
so
much
that
it
took
her
few
attempts
to
close
down
mollison
you
ll
see
she
repeated
all
right
we
better
get
on
needs
to
go
in
minute
ll
check
your
blood
pressure
first
parminder
was
doing
tessa
favour
seeing
her
late
like
this
after
school
the
practice
nurse
who
lived
in
yarvil
was
going
to
drop
off
tessa
blood
to
the
hospital
on
her
way
home
feeling
nervous
and
oddly
vulnerable
tessa
rolled
up
the
sleeve
of
the
old
green
cardigan
the
doctor
wound
the
around
her
upper
arm
at
close
parminder
strong
resemblance
to
her
second
daughter
was
revealed
for
their
different
parminder
being
and
sukhvinder
became
and
the
of
their
features
emerged
the
nose
the
wide
mouth
with
its
full
lower
lip
and
the
large
round
dark
eyes
the
tightened
painfully
around
tessa
upper
arm
while
parminder
watched
the
one
sixty
five
over
eight
said
parminder
that
high
tessa
too
high
and
in
all
her
she
stripped
the
from
straightened
out
tessa
pale
strewn
arm
and
slid
the
needle
into
the
taking
stuart
into
yarvil
tomorrow
night
tessa
said
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
to
get
him
suit
for
the
funeral
can
stand
the
scene
there
ll
be
if
he
to
go
in
jeans
colin
ll
go
she
was
trying
to
her
own
thoughts
from
the
dark
mysterious
liquid
flowing
up
into
the
little
plastic
tube
she
was
afraid
that
it
would
her
that
she
had
not
been
as
good
as
she
should
have
been
that
all
the
chocolate
bars
and
she
had
eaten
would
show
up
as
then
she
thought
bitterly
that
it
would
be
much
easier
to
resist
chocolate
if
her
life
were
less
given
that
she
spent
nearly
all
her
time
trying
to
help
other
people
it
was
hard
to
see
as
so
very
as
she
watched
parminder
of
her
blood
she
found
herself
hoping
though
her
husband
and
friend
might
think
it
that
howard
mollison
would
triumph
and
prevent
an
election
happening
at
all
