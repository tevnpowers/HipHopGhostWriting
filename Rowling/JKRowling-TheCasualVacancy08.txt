was
still
compared
to
the
right
terri
addiction
had
aunt
cheryl
was
matter
of
fact
about
the
decision
to
remove
the
two
neglected
children
from
their
parents
it
ad
to
said
cheryl
john
and
were
distant
relatives
krystal
had
never
known
where
or
how
they
fitted
in
her
family
tree
or
how
they
had
what
to
hear
terri
tell
it
sounded
like
after
much
with
the
they
had
been
allowed
to
the
children
terri
who
had
remained
with
until
his
arrest
never
saw
anne
or
for
reasons
krystal
did
not
entirely
understand
the
whole
story
was
and
with
hatred
and
things
said
and
threatened
orders
more
social
workers
who
your
dad
then
asked
fats
said
krystal
she
struggled
to
recall
his
real
name
barry
she
muttered
though
she
had
suspicion
that
was
not
right
barry
me
mum
name
weedon
the
memory
of
the
dead
young
man
who
had
in
terri
bathroom
back
to
her
through
the
sweet
heavy
smoke
she
passed
the
joint
back
to
fats
and
leaned
her
head
against
the
stone
wall
looking
up
at
the
of
sky
mottled
with
dark
leaves
fats
was
thinking
about
who
had
killed
man
and
the
possibility
that
his
own
father
was
in
somewhere
too
like
spare
and
he
mentally
compared
cubby
with
this
strong
hard
authentic
man
fats
knew
that
he
had
been
parted
from
his
mother
as
very
small
baby
because
there
were
pictures
of
tessa
holding
him
frail
and
like
with
white
cap
on
his
head
he
had
been
premature
tessa
had
told
him
few
things
though
he
had
never
asked
his
real
mother
had
been
very
young
when
she
had
him
he
knew
that
perhaps
she
had
been
like
krystal
the
school
bike
he
was
properly
now
he
put
his
hand
behind
krystal
neck
and
pulled
her
towards
him
kissing
her
sticking
his
tongue
into
her
mouth
with
his
other
hand
he
for
her
breast
his
brain
was
and
his
were
heavy
even
his
sense
of
touch
seemed
affected
he
fumbled
little
to
get
his
hand
inside
her
shirt
to
force
it
under
her
bra
her
mouth
was
hot
and
of
and
her
lips
were
dry
and
his
excitement
was
slightly
he
seemed
to
be
receiving
all
information
through
an
invisible
it
took
longer
than
the
last
time
to
her
clothes
loose
from
her
body
and
the
was
difficult
because
his
fingers
had
become
stiff
and
slow
then
he
accidentally
placed
his
elbow
with
all
his
weight
behind
it
on
her
soft
and
she
shrieked
in
pain
she
was
than
before
he
forced
his
way
inside
her
determined
to
what
he
had
come
for
time
was
like
and
slow
but
he
could
hear
his
own
rapid
breathing
and
it
made
him
because
he
imagined
someone
else
crouching
in
the
dark
space
with
them
watching
in
his
ear
krystal
little
with
her
head
thrown
back
her
nose
became
broad
and
like
he
pushed
up
her
shirt
to
look
at
the
smooth
white
breasts
little
beneath
the
loose
of
the
bra
he
came
without
expecting
it
and
his
own
of
satisfaction
seemed
to
belong
to
the
crouching
he
rolled
off
her
off
the
and
threw
it
aside
then
himself
up
feeling
looking
around
to
check
that
they
were
definitely
alone
krystal
was
dragging
her
pants
up
with
one
hand
pulling
down
her
shirt
with
the
other
reaching
behind
herself
to
do
up
her
bra
it
had
become
and
darker
while
they
had
sat
behind
the
bushes
there
was
distant
in
fats
ears
he
was
very
hungry
his
brain
was
working
slowly
while
his
ears
were
the
fear
that
they
had
been
watched
perhaps
over
the
top
of
the
wall
behind
them
would
not
leave
him
he
wanted
to
go
let
he
muttered
and
without
waiting
for
her
he
out
between
the
bushes
and
got
to
his
feet
himself
down
there
was
an
elderly
couple
hundred
yards
away
crouching
at
he
wanted
to
get
right
away
from
eyes
that
might
or
might
not
have
watched
him
krystal
weedon
but
at
the
same
time
the
process
of
finding
the
right
bus
stop
and
getting
on
the
bus
to
pagford
seemed
almost
he
wished
he
could
simply
be
this
instant
to
his
bedroom
krystal
had
out
behind
him
she
was
pulling
down
the
bottom
of
her
shirt
and
staring
down
at
the
ground
at
her
feet
fuck
she
mumbled
what
said
fats
let
go
mr
fairbrother
she
said
without
moving
what
she
pointed
at
the
in
front
of
them
there
was
no
yet
but
fresh
flowers
lay
all
along
it
see
she
said
crouching
over
and
cards
to
the
tha
fairbrother
she
recognized
the
name
easily
from
all
those
letters
that
had
gone
home
from
school
asking
her
mother
to
give
permission
for
her
to
go
away
on
the
ter
barry
she
read
carefully
an
this
ter
dad
she
sounded
out
the
words
slowly
from
but
niamh
and
siobhan
names
her
so
demanded
fats
but
in
truth
the
news
gave
him
the
that
coffin
lay
feet
below
them
and
inside
it
the
short
body
and
face
of
cubby
friend
so
often
seen
in
their
house
away
in
the
earth
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
he
was
unnerved
it
seemed
like
some
kind
of
he
said
but
krystal
did
not
move
what
the
matter
for
im
di
snapped
krystal
oh
yeah
fats
was
like
backwards
krystal
stared
down
at
the
herself
she
felt
empty
sad
and
dirty
she
wished
they
had
not
done
it
there
so
close
to
mr
fairbrother
she
was
cold
unlike
fats
she
had
no
jacket
said
fats
again
she
followed
him
out
of
the
and
they
did
not
speak
to
each
other
once
krystal
was
thinking
about
mr
fairbrother
he
had
always
called
her
krys
which
nobody
else
had
ever
done
she
had
liked
being
krys
he
had
been
good
laugh
she
wanted
to
cry
fats
was
thinking
about
how
he
would
be
able
to
work
this
into
funny
story
for
andrew
about
being
and
fucking
krystal
and
getting
and
thinking
they
were
being
watched
and
out
almost
onto
old
barry
fairbrother
grave
but
it
did
not
feel
funny
yet
not
yet
resolution
should
not
deal
with
more
than
one
subject
of
this
rule
usually
to
confused
discussion
and
may
lead
to
confused
action
charles
arnold
baker
local
council
administration
seventh
edition
ran
out
of
here
screaming
blue
murder
calling
her
bitch
and
now
the
paper
called
for
comment
because
she
parminder
heard
the
voice
barely
louder
than
whisper
as
she
passed
the
door
of
the
staff
meeting
room
which
was
one
swift
light
step
and
parminder
had
pulled
it
open
to
reveal
one
of
the
and
the
practice
nurse
in
close
proximity
both
jumped
and
round
you
understand
the
agreement
you
signed
when
you
took
this
job

district
gazette

of
her

parminder
coldly
pointing
at
the
patient
in
hand
oh
yeah
said
he
wanted
to
see
dr
but
you
better
get
back
to
the
front
desk
parminder
took
the
patient
and
strode
back
out
to
reception
once
there
and
facing
the
patients
she
realized
that
she
did
not
know
whom
to
call
and
glanced
down
at
the
folder
in
her
hand
mr
mr
mollison
howard
heaved
himself
up
smiling
and
walked
towards
her
with
his
familiar
dislike
rose
like
in
parminder
throat
she
turned
and
walked
back
to
her
surgery
howard
following
her
all
well
with
parminder
he
asked
as
he
closed
her
door
and
settled
himself
without
invitation
on
the
patient
chair
it
was
his
greeting
but
today
it
felt
like
what
the
problem
she
asked
bit
of
an
irritation
he
said
just
here
need
cream
or
something
he
tugged
his
shirt
out
of
his
trousers
and
lifted
it
few
inches
parminder
saw
an
angry
red
patch
of
skin
at
the
edge
of
the
fold
where
his
stomach
spilt
out
over
his
upper
legs
you
ll
need
to
take
your
shirt
off
she
said
it
only
here
that
need
to
see
the
whole
area
he
sighed
and
got
to
his
feet
as
he
his
shirt
he
said
did
you
get
the
agenda
sent
through
this
morning
no
haven
checked
today
this
was
lie
parminder
had
read
his
agenda
and
was
furious
about
it
but
this
was
not
the
moment
to
tell
him
so
she
his
trying
to
bring
council
business
into
her
surgery
his
way
of
her
that
there
was
place
where
she
was
his
even
if
here
in
this
room
she
could
order
him
to
strip
could
you
please
need
to
look
under
he
the
great
apron
of
flesh
the
upper
legs
of
his
trousers
were
revealed
and
finally
the
with
his
arms
full
of
his
own
fat
he
smiled
down
at
her
she
drew
her
chair
her
head
level
with
his
belt
an
ugly
rash
had
spread
in
the
hidden
of
howard
belly
bright
red
it
stretched
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
his
like
huge
smeared
smile
whiff
of
meat
reached
her
nostrils
she
said
and
there
where
you
ve
scratched
all
right

put
your
shirt
back
on
he
dropped
his
belly
and
reached
for
his
shirt
you
ll
see
ve
put
the
bellchapel
building
on
the
agenda
it
bit
of
press
interest
at
the
moment
she
was
something
into
the
computer
and
did
not
reply
yarvil
and
district
gazette
howard
said
doing
them
an
article
both
sides
he
said
up
his
shirt
of
the
question
she
was
trying
not
to
listen
to
him
but
the
sound
of
the
newspaper
name
caused
the
knot
in
her
stomach
to
when

it
and

up
to
fetch

watched
her
work
the
and
the
pressure
with
the
smile
of
man
some
ritual
too
high
she
told
him
as
the
needle
registered
one
hundred
and
over
hundred
on
for

he
said
scratching
where

with
the

to
howard
without

kitchen
she
had
managed
longer
than

before

even

she
watched
until
cheryl

and
had
vanished
around
the
corner
then
inside
nana
cath
dead
they
had
not
spoken
for
long
time
my
of
yeh
ve
ad
enough
terri
ve
ad
it
she
had
never
stopped
seeing
krystal
though
krystal
had
become
her
blue
eyed
girl
she
had
been
to
watch
krystal
row
in
her
stupid
she
had
said
krystal
name
on
her
not
terri
fine
then
you
old
bitch
like
care
too
late
now
tight
and
trembling
terri
moved
through
her
kitchen
in
search
of
cigarettes
but
really
the
spoon
the
flame
and
the
needle
too
late
now
to
say
to
the
old
lady
what
she
ought
to
have
said
too
late
now
to
become
again
her
terri
baby
big
girls
don
cry
big
girls
don
cry
it
had
been
years
before
she
had
realized
that
the
song
nana
cath
had
her
in
her
voice
was
really
baby
terri
hands
like
through
the
on
the
work
searching
for
them
apart
finding
them
all
empty
krystal
had
probably
had
the
last
of
them
she
was
little
cow
just
like
through
nana
cath
trying
to
keep
her
death
quiet
from
the
rest
of
them
there
was
long
lying
on
plate
terri
wiped
it
off
on
her
shirt
and
lit
it
on
the
gas
inside
her
head
she
heard
her
own
eleven
year
old
voice
wish
you
was
my
mummy
she
did
not
want
to
remember
she
leaned
up
against
the
sink
smoking
trying
to
look
forward
to
imagine
the
that
was
coming
between
her
two
older
sisters
nobody
with
cheryl
and
they
were
both
with
their
fists
and
had
put
burning
through
some
poor
bastard
letter
box
not
so
long
ago
it
was
why
he
done
his
last
stretch
and
he
would
still
be
inside
if
the
house
had
not
been
empty
at
the
time
but
had
cheryl
did
not
money
and
her
own
home
and
she
knew
official
people
and
how
to
talk
to
them
she
was
the
kind
that
had
spare
keys
and
mysterious
bits
of
yet
terri
doubted
that
would
get
the
house
even
with
her
secret
there
were
more
than
just
the
three
of
them
nana
cath
had
had
of
and
great
after
terri
had
been
taken
into
care
her
father
had
had
more
kids
nine
in
total
cheryl
to
five
different
mothers
terri
had
never
met
her
half
but
krystal
had
told
her
that
nana
cath
saw
them
yeah
she
had
hope
they
her
the
stupid
old
bitch
so
she
saw
the
rest
of
the
family
but
they
weren
exactly
from
all
that
terri
had
heard
it
was
only
she
who
had
once
been
terri
baby
whom
nana
cath
had
cut
for
ever
when
you
were
straight
evil
thoughts
and
memories
came
pouring
up
out
of
the
darkness
inside
you
black
flies
clinging
to
the
insides
of
your
wish
you
was
my
mummy
in
the
top
that
terri
was
wearing
today
her
arm
neck
and
upper
back
were
fully
exposed
into
unnatural
and
like
ice
cream
she
had
spent
six
weeks
in
the
unit
of
south
west
general
when
she
was
eleven
how
did
it
happen
love
asked
the
mother
of
the
child
in
the
next
bed
her
father
had
thrown
of
burning
fat
at
her
her
human
shirt
had
caught
fire
terri
muttered
it
was
what
she
had
told
everyone
including
the
social
worker
and
the
nurses
she
would
no
sooner
have
her
father
than
chosen
to
alive
her
mother
had
walked
out
shortly
after
terri
birthday
leaving
all
three
daughters
behind
and
cheryl
had
moved
in
with
their
families
within
days
terri
had
been
the
only
one
left
trying
to
make
chips
for
her
father
clinging
to
the
hope
that
her
mother
would
come
back
even
through
the
and
the
terror
of
those
first
days
and
nights
in
the
hospital
she
had
been
glad
it
had
happened
because
she
was
sure
that
her
mum
would
hear
about
it
and
come
and
get
her
every
time
there
was
movement
at
the
end
of
the
terri
heart
would
but
in
six
long
weeks
of
pain
and
the
only
visitor
had
been
nana
cath
through
quiet
and
evenings
nana
cath
had
come
to
sit
beside
her
granddaughter
her
to
say
thank
you
to
the
nurses
faced
and
yet
unexpected
she
brought
terri
cheap
plastic
in
shiny
black
but
when
terri
her
she
had
nothing
on
underneath
she
got
no
nana
and
nana
cath
had
nana
cath
never
wish
you
was
my
mummy
she
had
wanted
nana
cath
to
take
her
home
she
had
asked
her
to
and
nana
cath
had
agreed
sometimes
terri
thought
that
those
weeks
in
hospital
had
been
the
of
her
life
even
with
the
pain
it
had
been
so
safe
and
people
had
been
kind
to
her
and
looked
after
her
she
had
thought
that
she
was
going
home
with
nana
cath
to
the
house
with
the
pretty
net
curtains
and
not
back
to
her
father
not
back
to
the
bedroom
door
open
in
the
night
off
the
cheryl
had
left
behind
and
her
father
with
his
hand
on
his
fly
approaching
the
bed
where
she
him
not
to
the
adult
terri
threw
the
smoking
of
the
cigarette
down
onto
the
kitchen
floor
and
strode
to
her
front
door
she
needed
more
than
down
the
path
and
along
the
street
she
marched
walking
in
the
same
direction
as
cheryl
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
she
saw
them
two
of
her
neighbours
on
the
pavement
watching
her
go
by
like
fucking
picture
it
ll
last
longer
terri
knew
that
she
was
subject
of
gossip
she
knew
what
they
said
about
her
they
shouted
it
after
her
sometimes
the
stuck
up
bitch
next
door
was
forever
whining
to
the
council
about
the
state
of
terri
garden
fuck
them

asked

outside

scars
on
her
back
felt
as
though
they
were

he
shook
his
head
chewing
at
her
she
hurried
on
thoughts
of
the
social
worker
of
krystal
of
robbie
more
flies
but
they
were
like
the
staring
neighbours
all
they
did
not
understand
the
terrible
of
her
need
nana
cath
had
collected
her
from
the
hospital
and
taken
her
home
to
the
spare

been
the
room

had
ever
slept
in
on
each
of
the
three
evenings

sat
up

after

been
bunch
of
glass
flowers

its
of

ending
in

hair
while

and

yards
away

the
woman
turning
away
when
michael

not
beating
terri
he
was
doing
the
other
things
to
her
the
things
she
could
not
talk
about
nana
cath

terri
ran
away
at
thirteen
but
not
to
nana
cath
she
did
not
want
her
father
to
find
her
they
caught
her
anyway
and
put
her
into
care
terri
on
obbo
door
and
waited
she
tried
again
but
nobody
came
she
sank
onto
the
shaking
and
began
to
cry
two
winterdown
girls
glanced
at
her
as
they
passed
tha
krystal
weedon
mum
one
of
them
said
loudly
the
the
other
replied
at
the
top
of
her
voice
terri
could
not
the
strength
to
swear
at
them
because
she
was
crying
so
hard
and
giggling
the
girls
strode
out
of
sight
whore
one
of
them
called
back
from
the
end
of
the
street
iii
gavin
could
have
invited
mary
into
his
office
to
discuss
the
most
recent
exchange
of
letters
with
the
insurance
company
but
decided
to
visit
her
at
home
instead
he
had
kept
the
late
afternoon
free
of
appointments
on
the
off
chance
that
she
might
ask
him
to
stay
for
something
to
eat
she
was
cook
his
instinctive
away
from
her
naked
grief
had
been
by
regular
contact
he
had
always
liked
mary
but
barry
had
her
in
company
not
that
she
ever
appeared
to
dislike
her
role
on
the
she
had
seemed
delighted
to
the
background
happy
laughing
at
barry
jokes
happy
simply
to
be
with
him
gavin
doubted
that
kay
had
ever
been
happy
to
play
second
in
her
life
crashing
the
as
he
drove
up
church
row
he
thought
that
kay
would
have
been
outraged
by
any
suggestion
that
she
her
behaviour
or
her
for
the
sake
of
her
partner
his
happiness
or
his
self
he
did
not
think
that
he
had
ever
been
in
relationship
than
he
was
now
even
in
the
death
of
the
affair
with
there
had
been
temporary
sudden
of
better
times
the
situation
with
kay
was
like
war
sometimes
he
forgot
that
there
was
supposed
to
be
any
affection
between
them
did
she
even
like
him
they
had
had
their
worst
ever
argument
by
telephone
on
the
morning
after
miles
and
samantha
dinner
party
eventually
kay
had
slammed
down
the
receiver
cutting
gavin
off
for
full
twenty
four
hours
he
had
believed
that
their
relationship
was
at
an
end
and
although
this
was
what
he
wanted
he
had
experienced
more
fear
than
relief
in
his
fantasies
kay
simply
disappeared
back
to
london
but
the
reality
was
that
she
had
herself
to
pagford
with
job
and
daughter
at
winterdown
he
faced
the
prospect
of
into
her
wherever
he
went
in
the
tiny
town
perhaps
she
was
already
the
well
of
gossip
against
him
he
imagined
her
some
of
the
things
she
had
said
to
him
on
the
telephone
to
samantha
or
to
that
old
woman
in
the
delicatessen
who
gave
him
flesh
my
daughter
and
left
my
job
and
moved
house
for
you
and
you
treat
me
like
you
don
have
to
pay
people
would
say
that
he
had
badly
perhaps
he
had
badly
there
must
have
been
crucial
point
when
he
ought
to
have
pulled
back
but
he
had
not
seen
it
gavin
spent
the
whole
weekend
on
how
it
would
feel
to
be
seen
as
the
bad
he
had
never
been
in
that
position
before
after
had
left
him
everybody
had
been
kind
and
sympathetic
especially
the
fairbrothers
guilt
and
dread
him
until
on
sunday
evening
he
cracked
and
called
kay
to
now
he
was
back
where
he
did
not
want
to
be
and
he
hated
kay
for
it
parking
his
car
in
the
fairbrothers
drive
as
he
had
done
so
often
when
barry
was
alive
he
headed
for
the
front
door
noticing
that
somebody
had
the
lawn
since
he
had
last
called
mary
answered
his
ring
on
the
doorbell
almost
hi
how
mary
what
wrong
her
whole
face
was
wet
her
eyes
with
bright
tears
she
once
or
twice
shook
her
head
and
then
without
quite
knowing
how
it
had
happened
gavin
found
himself
holding
her
in
his
arms
on
the
mary
has
something
happened
he
felt
her
nod
aware
of
their
exposed
position
of
the
open
road
behind
him
gavin
her
inside
she
was
small
and
fragile
in
his
arms
her
fingers
clutched
at
him
her
face
pressed
into
his
coat
he
his
briefcase
as
gently
as
he
could
but
the
sound
of
it
the
floor
made
her
from
him
her
breath
short
as
she
covered
her
mouth
with
her
hands
sorry
sorry
oh
god
gav
what
happened
his
voice
sounded
different
from
usual
take
command
more
like
the
way
miles
sometimes
talked
in
at
work
someone
put
don
someone
put
barry
she
him
into
the
home
office
cluttered
shabby
and
with
barry
old
rowing
on
the
shelves
and
big
framed
photograph
on
the
wall
of
eight
teenage
girls
the
air
with
around
their
mary
pointed
trembling
finger
at
the
computer
screen
still
in
his
coat
gavin
dropped
into
the
chair
and
stared
at
the
message
board
of
pagford
parish
council
website
was
in
the
delicatessen
this
morning
and
maureen
lowe
told
me
that
of
people
had
put
messages
of
on
the
site
so
was
going
to
post
message
to
say
thank
you
and
look
he
spotted
it
as
she
spoke
simon
price
to
stand
for
council
by
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
christ
said
gavin
in
disgust
mary
dissolved
into
tears
again
gavin
wanted
to
put
his
arms
back
around
her
but
was
afraid
to
especially
here
in
this
little
room
so
full
of
barry
he
by
taking
hold
of
her
thin
wrist
and
leading
her
through
the
hall
into
the
kitchen
you
need
drink
he
told
her
in
that
strong
and
voice
coffee
where
the
proper
stuff
but
he
remembered
before
she
answered
he
had
seen
barry
take
the
bottles
out
of
the
cupboard
often
enough
so
he
her
small
and
which
was
the
only
thing
he
had
ever
known
her
drink
before
dinner
gav
it
four
in
the
afternoon
who
damn
said
gavin
in
his
new
voice
get
that
down
you
an
laugh
broke
her
sobs
she
accepted
the
glass
and
he
her
kitchen
roll
to
mop
her
face
and
eyes
you
re
so
kind
gav
don
you
want
anything
coffee
or
or
beer
she
asked
on
another
weak
laugh
he
himself
bottle
from
the
fridge
took
off
his
coat
and
sat
down
opposite
her
at
the
island
in
the
middle
of
the
room
after
while
when
she
had
drunk
most
of
her
she
became
calm
and
quiet
again
the
way
he
always
thought
of
her
who
you
think
did
it
she
asked
him
some
total
bastard
said
gavin
they
re
all
fighting
over
his
council
seat
now
away
over
the
fields
as
usual
and
he
still
in
there
putting
his
two
in
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
maybe
it
really
is
him
on
the
message
board
gavin
did
not
know
whether
this
was
meant
as
joke
and
settled
for
slight
smile
that
might
be
quickly
removed
you
know
love
to
think
that
he
about
us
wherever
he
is
about
me
and
the
kids
but
doubt
it
ll
bet
he
still
most
worried
about
krystal
weedon
do
you
know
what
he
probably
say
to
me
if
he
was
here
she
drained
her
glass
gavin
had
not
thought
that
he
had
the
very
strong
but
there
were
patches
of
high
colour
on
her
cheeks
no
he
said
he
tell
me
that
ve
got
support
said
mary
and
to
gavin
he
heard
anger
in
the
voice
he
always
thought
of
as
gentle
yeah
he
probably
say
you
ve
got
all
the
family
and
our
friends
and
the
kids
to
comfort
you
but
krystal
mary
voice
was
becoming
louder
krystal
got
nobody
to
look
out
for
her
you
know
what
he
spent
our
wedding
anniversary
doing
no
said
gavin
again
writing
an
article
for
the
local
paper
about
krystal
krystal
and
the
fields
the
bloody
fields
if
never
hear
them
mentioned
again
it
ll
be
too
soon
want
another
don
drink
enough
gavin
picked
up
her
glass
automatically
and
returned
to
the
drinks
cupboard
stunned
he
had
always
regarded
her
and
barry
marriage
as
perfect
never
had
it
occurred
to
him
that
mary
might
be
other
than
one
hundred
of
every
and
with
which
the
ever
busy
barry
concerned
himself
rowing
practice
in
the
evenings
driving
them
to
at
the
weekends
she
said
over
the
of
ice
he
was
adding
to
her
glass
and
most
nights
he
was
on
the
computer
trying
to
get
people
to
support
him
about
the
fields
and
getting
stuff
on
the
agenda
for
council
meetings
and
everyone
always
said
isn
barry
the
way
he
does
it
all
the
way
he
he
so
involved
with
the
community
she
took
big
of
her
fresh
and
yes
absolutely
until
it
killed
him
all
day
long
on
our
wedding
anniversary
struggling
to
meet
that
stupid
they
haven
even
printed
it
yet
gavin
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
anger
and
alcohol
had
colour
to
her
face
she
was
sitting
upright
instead
of
and
over
as
she
had
been
recently
that
what
killed
him
she
said
clearly
and
her
voice
echoed
little
in
the
kitchen
he
gave
everything
to
everybody
except
to
me
ever
since
barry
funeral
gavin
had
with
sense
of
deep
on
the
comparatively
small
gap
that
he
was
sure
he
would
leave
behind
in
his
community
should
he
die
looking
at
mary
he
wondered
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
leave
huge
hole
in
one
person
heart
had
barry
not
realized
how
mary
felt
had
he
not
realized
how
lucky
he
was
the
front
door
opened
with
loud
clatter
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
four
children
coming
in
voices
and
footsteps
and
the
of
shoes
and
bags
hi
gav
said
eighteen
year
old
fergus
kissing
his
mother
on
top
of
her
head
are
you
drinking
mum
it
my
fault
said
gavin
blame
me
they
were
such
nice
kids
the
fairbrother
kids
gavin
liked
the
way
they
talked
to
their
mother
her
to
each
other
and
to
him
they
were
open
polite
and
funny
he
thought
of
gaia
her
vicious
like
glass
the
way
she
addressed
him
gav
we
haven
even
talked
about
the
insurance
said
mary
as
the
children
around
the
kitchen
finding
themselves
drinks
and

look
of
delighted
was
her
face
samantha
who
was
in
very
bad
mood
thought
she
resembled
miles
was
making
conventional
sounds
of
surprise
and
pity
but
shirley
was
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
with
expression
on
her
face
she
hated
it
when
maureen
held
centre
stage
with
news
that
she
ought
to
have
heard
first
my
mother
knew
the
family
of
old
howard

samantha
who
already
knew

in
hope

decent
enough
in
her
way
you
know
the
house
was
always
and
she
worked
until
she
was
into
her
oh

was
one
of
the
world
cath
weedon
whatever
the
rest
of
the
family
became
howard
was
enjoying
giving
credit
where
credit
was
due
the
husband
lost
his
job
when
they
closed
the
hard
no
she
didn
always
have
it
easy
cath

barely
to
look
interested
but
maureen
interrupted

croaked

how
she
must
be
feeling

that
house

three
days

up
and
out
of
the
room

her
apron

on
the
cards
if
anything
surprised

this
long
dr
jawanda
wouldn
give
the
son
and
he
ended
up
for
his
do
you
know
did
she
train
in
or
shirley
who
was
listening
from
the
kitchen
while
she
the
felt
irritated
as
she
always
did
by
maureen
of
the
conversation
that
at
least
was
how
shirley
put
it
to
herself
determined
not
to
return
to
the
room
until
maureen
had
finished
shirley
turned
into
the
study
and
checked
to
see
whether
anyone
had
sent
in
for
the
next
parish
council
meeting
as
secretary
she
was
already
putting
together
the
agenda
howard
miles
come
and
look
at
this
shirley
voice
had
lost
its
usual
soft
quality
it
rang
out
howard
out
of
the
sitting
room
followed
by
miles
who
was
still
in
the
suit
he
had
worn
all
day
at
work
maureen
bloodshot
heavily
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
empty
doorway
like
her
to
know
what
shirley
had
found
or
seen
was
almost
maureen
fingers
of
bulging
knuckles
covered
in
spotted
skin
slid
the
and
wedding
ring
up
and
down
the
chain
around
her
neck
the
deep
running
from
the
of
maureen
mouth
to
her
chin
always
reminded
samantha
of
why
are
you
always
here
samantha
asked
the
older
woman
loudly
inside
her
own
head
you
couldn
make
me
lonely
enough
to
live
in
howard
and
shirley
pocket
disgust
rose
in
samantha
like
vomit
she
wanted
to
the
over
warm
cluttered
room
and
it
between
her
hands
until
the
china
and
the
gas
fire
and
the
framed
pictures
of
miles
broke
into
pieces
then
with
and
painted
maureen
trapped
and
inside
the
she
wanted
to
it
like
shot
away
into
the
the
and
the
inside
it
soared
in
her
imagination
through
the
into
the
leaving
samantha
alone
in
the
endless
stillness
of
the
she
had
had
terrible
afternoon
there
had
been
another
conversation
with
her
accountant
she
could
not
remember
much
of
her
drive
home
from
yarvil
she
would
have
liked
to
on
miles
but
after
his
briefcase
and
pulling
off
his
tie
in
the
hall
he
had
said
you
haven
started
dinner
yet
have
you
he
the
air
then
answered
himself
no
you
haven
well
good
because
mum
and
dad
have
invited
us
over
and
before
she
could
protest
he
had
added
sharply
it
nothing
to
do
with
the
council
it
to
discuss
for
dad
sixty
fifth
anger
was
almost
relief
it
her
anxiety
her
fear
she
had
followed
miles
out
to
the
car
her
sense
of
ill
when
he
asked
at
last
on
the
corner
of
how
was
your
day
she
answered
absolutely
bloody
wonder
what
up
said
maureen
breaking
the
silence
in
the
sitting
room
samantha
it
was
of
shirley
to
have
summoned
her
and
left
the
women
in
samantha
was
not
going
to
give
her
mother
in
law
the
satisfaction
of
showing
interest
howard
footsteps
made
the
under
the
hall
carpet
maureen
mouth
was
slack
with
anticipation
well
well
well
boomed
howard
back
into
the
room
was
checking
the
council
website
for
said
shirley
little
in
his
wake
for
the
next
meeting
someone
about
simon
price
miles
told
samantha
pressing
past
his
parents
the
role
of
what
kind
of
asked
samantha
receiving
stolen
goods
said
howard
firmly
the
and
his
at
the
printworks
samantha
was
pleased
to
find
herself
she
had
only
the
idea
who
simon
price
was
they
ve
under
howard
continued
and
it
not
particularly
either
rude
you
mean
samantha
asked
big
fat
or
something
howard
laughter
boomed
through
the
room
maureen
gave
an
affected
of
horror
but
miles
and
shirley
looked
furious
not
quite
that
sammy
no
said
howard
no
they
ve
called
themselves
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
oh
said
samantha
her
grin
she
did
not
like
that
after
all
she
had
been
in
the
ambulance
while
they
had
forced
needles
and
into
barry
collapsed
body
she
had
watched
him
dying
beneath
the
plastic
mask
seen
mary
clinging
to
his
hand
heard
her
and
sobs
oh
no
that
not
nice
said
maureen
in
her
voice
no
that
nasty
putting
words
into
the
mouths
of
the
dead
taking
names
in
that
not
right
no
agreed
howard
almost
absent
mindedly
he
across
the
room
picked
up
the
wine
bottle
and
returned
to
samantha
up
her
empty
glass
but
someone
out
there
doesn
care
about
good
taste
it
seems
if
they
can
put
simon
price
out
of
the
running
if
you
re
thinking
what
think
you
re
thinking
dad
said
miles
wouldn
they
have
gone
for
me
rather
than
price
how
do
you
know
they
haven
miles
meaning
asked
miles
swiftly
meaning
said
howard
the
happy
of
all
eyes
that
got
sent
an
anonymous
letter
about
you
couple
of
weeks
ago
nothing
specific
just
said
you
were
to
fill
fairbrother
shoes
be
very
surprised
if
the
letter
didn
come
from
the
same
source
as
the
online
post
the
fairbrother
in
both
you
see
samantha
her
glass
little
too
so
that
wine
down
the
sides
of
her
chin
exactly
where
her
own
would
no
doubt
appear
in
time
she
her
face
with
her
sleeve
where
is
this
letter
asked
miles
not
to
look
rattled
it
it
was
anonymous
it
didn
we
didn
want
to
upset
you
dear
said
shirley
and
she
patted
miles
arm
anyway
they
can
have
anything
on
you
howard
his
son
or
they
have
the
dirt
the
same
as
they
have
on
price
simon
price
wife
is
lovely
girl
said
shirley
with
gentle
regret
can
believe
ruth
knows
anything
about
it
if
her
husband
been
on
the
she
friend
from
the
hospital
shirley
to
maureen
an
nurse
she
wouldn
be
the
first
wife
who
hasn
spotted
what
going
on
under
her
nose
maureen
knowledge
with
wisdom
absolutely
using
barry
fairbrother
name
said
shirley
pretending
not
to
have
heard
maureen
not
thought
for
his
widow
his
family
all
that
matters
is
their
agenda
they
ll
sacrifice
anything
to
it
shows
you
what
we
re
up
against
said
howard
he
scratched
the
of
his
belly
thinking
it
saw
from
the
get
go
that
price
was
going
to
split
the
pro
fields
vote
no
flies
on
bends
your
ear
she
realized
it
too
and
she
wants
him
out
but
said
samantha
it
have
anything
to
do
with
parminder
and
that
lot
at
all
it
could
be
from
someone
we
don
know
someone
who
got
grudge
against
simon
price
oh
sam
said
shirley
with
laugh
shaking
her
head
it
easy
to
see
you
re
new
to
politics
oh
fuck
off
shirley
so
why
have
they
used
barry
fairbrother
name
then
asked
miles
on
his
wife
well
it
on
the
website
isn
it
it
his
vacant
seat
and
who
going
to
through
the
council
website
for
that
kind
of
information
no
he
said
this
is
an
an
libby
had
once
told
samantha
that
there
could
be
thousands
of
species
inside
one
drop
of
water
they
were
all
perfectly
ridiculous
samantha
thought
sitting
here
in
front
of
shirley
plates
as
if
they
were
in
the
cabinet
room
in
street
as
though
one
bit
of
on
parish
council
website
constituted
an
campaign
as
though
any
of
it
mattered
and
defiantly
samantha
her
attention
from
the
lot
of
them
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
window
and
the
clear
evening
sky
beyond
and
she
thought
about
the
boy
in
libby
favourite
band
at
lunchtime
today
samantha
had
gone
out
for
sandwiches
and
brought
back
music
in
which
and
his
were
interviewed
there
were
of
pictures
it
for
libby
samantha
had
told
the
girl
who
helped
her
in
the
shop
look
at
that
wouldn
kick
him
out
of
bed
for
eating
toast
replied
pointing
at
naked
from
the
waist
up
his
head
thrown
back
to
reveal
that
thick
strong
neck
oh
but
he
only
twenty
one
look
not
was
twenty
six
samantha
did
not
care
to
age
from
her
own
she
had
eaten
her
sandwich
and
read
the
interview
and
studied
all
the
pictures
with
his
hands
on
bar
above
his
head
under
black
shirt
with
his
white
shirt
open
muscles
above
the
loose
of
his
jeans
samantha
drank
howard
wine
and
stared
out
at
the
sky
above
the
black
hedge
which
was
delicate
of
rose
pink
the
precise
her
had
been
before
they
had
been
and
by
pregnancy
and
breast
she
imagined
herself
nineteen
to
twenty
one
again
taut
in
the
right
places
and
strong
flat
stomach
of
her
own
fitting
comfortably
into
her
white
size
ten
she
recalled
how
it
felt
to
sit
on
young
man
lap
in
those
with
the
heat
and
of
sun
under
her
bare
and
big
hands
around
her
waist
she
imagined
breath
on
her
neck
she
imagined
turning
to
look
into
the
blue
eyes
close
to
the
high
cheekbones
and
that
firm
carved
mouth
at
the
church
hall
and
we
re
getting
it
by
said
howard
we
ve
invited
everyone
aubrey
and
julia
everyone
with
luck
it
will
be
double
celebration
you
on
the
council

another
year
young
samantha
felt
and
when
were
they
going
to
eat
she
realized
that
shirley
had
left
the
room
to
put
food
on
the
table
the
telephone
rang
at
samantha
elbow
and
she
jumped
before
any
of
them
could
move
shirley
had
back
in
she
had
one
hand
in
and
picked
up
the
receiver
with
the
other
double

shirley
on
rising

samantha

closest

the
other
woman
voice
but
not
make
out
the
words

maureen
mouth

hanging
open

ancient

her
head

son
shirley
told
howard

new

in
delicatessen
said
howard
she
wanted
to
ask
whether
you

in
the
fridge
for
him
just
in
case
said
shirley
maureen
they
ve
all
got
these
days
children
shirley
hand
was
still
clutching
the
receiver
she
was
hoping
to
feel
down
the
line
from
hilltop
house
ruth
stood
alone
in
her
lamp
lit
sitting
room
continuing
to
grip
the
telephone
she
had
just
replaced
in
its
hilltop
house
was
small
and
it
was
always
easy
to
tell
the
of
each
of
the
four
because
voices
and
the
sounds
of
doors
opening
and
carried
so
in
the
old
house
ruth
knew
that
her
husband
was
still
in
the
shower
because
she
could
hear
the
hot
water
under
the
stairs
and
she
had
waited
for
simon
to
turn
on
the
water
before
shirley
worried
that
he
might
think
that
even
her
request
about
the
was
with
the
enemy
the
family
pc
was
set
up
in
corner
of
the
sitting
room
where
simon
could
keep
an
eye
on
it
and
make
sure
nobody
was
running
up
large
bills
behind
his
back
ruth
her
grip
on
the
phone
and
hurried
to
the
it
seemed
to
take
very
long
time
to
bring
up
the
pagford
council
website
ruth
pushed
her
reading
glasses
up
her
nose
with
trembling
hand
as
she
the
various
pages
at
last
she
found
the
message
board
her
husband
name
out
at
her
in
ghastly
black
and
white
simon
price
to
stand
for
council
she
double
clicked
the
brought
up
the
full
paragraph
and
read
it
everything
around
her
seemed
to
and
oh
god
she
whispered
the
had
stopped
simon
would
be
putting
on
the
pyjamas
he
had
on
the
he
had
already
drawn
the
sitting
room
curtains
turned
on
the
side
lamps
and
lit
the
wood
so
that
he
could
come
down
and
stretch
out
on
the
sofa
to
watch
the
news
ruth
knew
that
she
would
have
to
tell
him
not
doing
so
letting
him
find
out
for
himself
was
simply
not
an
option
she
would
have
been
of
keeping
it
to
herself
she
felt
terrified
and
guilty
though
she
did
not
know
why
she
heard
him
down
the
stairs
and
then
he
appeared
at
the
door
in
his
blue
brushed
cotton
pyjamas
si
she
whispered
what
the
matter
he
said
immediately
irritated
he
knew
that
something
had
happened
that
his
programme
of
sofa
fire
and
news
was
about
to
be
she
pointed
at
the
computer
monitor
one
hand
pressed
over
her
mouth
like
little
girl
her
terror
him
he
strode
to
the
pc
and
down
at
the
screen
he
was
not
quick
he
read
every
word
every
line
carefully
when
he
had
finished
he
remained
quite
still
passing
for
review
in
his
mind
all
the
likely
he
thought
of
the
gum
chewing
driver
whom
he
had
left
in
the
fields
when
they
had
picked
up
the
new
computer
he
thought
of
and
who
did
the
cash
in
hand
jobs
on
the
sly
with
him
someone
from
work
must
have
talked
rage
and
fear
inside
him
and
set
off
reaction
he
strode
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
shouted
you
two
get
down
here
now
ruth
still
had
her
hand
over
her
mouth
he
had
urge
to
her
hand
away
to
tell
her
to
fucking
pull
herself
together
it
was
he
who
was
in
the
shit
andrew
entered
the
room
first
with
paul
behind
him
andrew
saw
the
arms
of
pagford
parish
council
and
his

simon
with

and
he
was
suddenly
in

andrew
scrambled
out
of
the
way
simon
was
the
end
of
his
foot
on
the
spot
and
swearing
in
high
pitched
voice
ruth
had
collapsed
into
the
swivel
chair
sobbing
into
her
hands
andrew
got
to
his
feet
he
could
taste
his
own
blood
anyone

for

violence
he
felt
now
that

told
on

my

simon
gasped
falling
backwards
into
an
armchair
still
nursing
his
foot
he
seemed
to
expect
sympathy
andrew
imagined
picking
up
and
simon
in
the
face
watching
his
features
apart
his
the
room
and
got
her
fucking
period
again
simon
yelled
at
paul
who
was
trying
to
contain
the
blood
through
his
fingers
from
his
nose
get
off
the
carpet
get
off
the
fucking
carpet
you
little
paul
out
of
the
room
andrew
pressed
the
of
his
shirt
to
his
mouth
what
about
all
the
cash
in
hand
jobs
ruth
sobbed
her
cheek
pink
from
his
punch
tears
from
her
chin
andrew
hated
to
see
her
and
pathetic
like
this
but
he
half
hated
her
too
for
landing
herself
in
it
when
any
could
have
seen
it
says
about
the
cash
in
hand
jobs
shirley
doesn
know
about

out
of

whining
cow

didn
mind
spending
the
money
yelled
simon
his
jaw
again
and
andrew
wanted
to
roar
at
his
mother
to
stay
silent
she
when
any
could
have
told
her
she
should
keep
quiet
and
she
kept
quiet
when
she
might
have
done
good
by
speaking
out
she
never
learned
she
never
saw
any
of
it
coming
nobody
spoke
for
minute
ruth
dabbed
at
her
eyes
with
the
back
of
her
hand
and
simon
clutched
his
his
jaw
clenched
breathing
loudly
andrew
the
blood
from
his
lip
which
he
could
feel
this
ll
cost
me
my
fucking
job
said
simon
staring
wild
eyed
around
the
room
as
if
there
might
be
somebody
there
he
had
forgotten
to
hit
they
re
already
talking
about
fucking
this
ll
be
it
this
ll
he
slapped
the
lamp
off
the
end
table
but
it
didn
break
merely
rolled
on
the
floor
he
picked
it
up
tugged
the
lead
out
of
the
wall
raised
it
over
his
head
and
threw
it
at
andrew
who

fucking
talked

yelled
as
the
lamp
broke
apart
on
the
wall
someone
fucking
talked
it

bastard

the
printworks

andrew
shouted
back
his
lip
was
thick
and
it
felt
like
you
think
we
have
you
think
we
don
know
how
to
keep
our
mouths
shut
by
now
it
was
like
trying
to
read
wild
animal
he
could
see
the
muscles
working
in
his
father
jaw
but
he
could
tell
that
simon
was
andrew
words
when
was
that
put
on
there
he
roared
at
ruth
look
at
it
what
the
date
on
it
still
sobbing
she
peered
at
the
screen
needing
to
approach
the
of
her
nose
within
two
inches
of
it
now
that
her
glasses
were
broken
the
she
whispered
sunday

simon
