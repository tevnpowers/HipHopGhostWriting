table
who
seemed
inclined
to
ease
her
passage
into
pagford
social
life
must
say
the
fields
are
pretty
rough
she
said
to
the
subject
with
which
miles
seemed
most
comfortable
and
still
ignorant
that
it
was
in
any
way
within
mary
ve
worked
in
the
inner
didn
expect
to
see
that
kind
of
in
area
but
it
not
all
that
different
from
london
less
of
an
of
course
oh
yes
we
ve
got
our
share
of
and
said
miles
think
that
about
all
can
manage
sam
he
added
pushing
his
plate
away
from
him
with
amount
of
food
still
on
it
samantha
started
to
clear
the
table
mary
got
up
to
help
no
no
it
fine
mary
you
samantha
said
to
kay
gavin
jumped
up
too
on
mary
sitting
back
down
but
mary
insisted
too
that
was
lovely
sam
said
mary
in
the
kitchen
as
they
scraped
most
of
the
food
into
the
bin
no
it
wasn
it
was
horrible
said
samantha
who
was
only
how
drunk
she
was
now
that
she
was
on
her
feet
what
do
you
think
of
kay
don
know
she
not
what
expected
said
mary
she
exactly
what
expected
said
samantha
taking
out
plates
for
pudding
she
another
if
you
ask
me
oh
no
don
say
that
said
mary
he
someone
nice
this
time
this
was
most
novel
point
of
view
to
samantha
who
was
of
the
opinion
that
gavin
constant
they
returned
to
the
dining
room
to
find
an
conversation
in
progress
between
kay
and
miles
while
gavin
sat
in
silence
responsibility
for
them
which
seems
to
me
to
be
pretty
self
and
self
satisfied
well
think
it
interesting
that
you
use
the
word
responsibility
said
miles
because
think
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
problem
doesn
it
the
question
is
where
exactly
do
we
draw
the
line
beyond
the
fields
apparently
kay
laughed
with
you
want
to
draw
line
neatly
between
the
home
middle
classes
and
the
lower
pagford
full
of
working
class
people
kay
the
difference
is
most
of
them
work
you
know
what
of
the
fields
lives
off
responsibility
you
say
what
happened
to
personal
responsibility
we
ve
had
them
through
the
local
school
for
years
kids
who
haven
got
single
worker
in
the
family
the
of
living
is
completely
foreign
to
them
generations
of
non
workers
and
we
re
expected
to
them
so
your
solution
is
to
off
the
problem
onto
yarvil
said
kay
not
to
with
any
of
the
pie
called
samantha
gavin
and
mary
took
with
thanks
kay
to
samantha
fury
simply
held
out
her
plate
as
though
samantha
were
waitress
her
attention
all
on
miles
the
addiction
clinic
which
is
absolutely
crucial
and
which
certain
people
are
apparently
to
close
oh
well
if
you
re
talking
about
bellchapel
said
miles
shaking
his
head
and
hope
you
ve
up
on
what
the
success
are
kay
pathetic
frankly
absolutely
pathetic
ve
seen
the
figures
was
going
through
them
this
morning
and
won
lie
to
you
the
sooner
they
close
and
the
figures
you
re
talking
about
are
success
kay
exactly
what
said
the
number
of
people
who
have
actually
stopped
using
drugs
gone
clean
sorry
but
that
very
naive
point
of
view
if
you
re
going
to
judge
success
purely
but
how
on
earth
else
are
we
supposed
to
judge
an
addiction
clinic
success
demanded
miles
as
far
as
can
tell
all
they
do
at
bellchapel
is
out
methadone
which
half
of
their
clients
use
alongside
heroin
anyway
the
whole
problem
of
addiction
is
immensely
complicated
said
kay
and
it
naive
and
to
put
the
problem
purely
in
terms
of
and
non
but
miles
was
shaking
his
head
smiling
kay
who
had
been
enjoying
her
with
this
self
satisfied
lawyer
was
suddenly
angry
well
can
give
you
very
example
of
what
bellchapel
doing
one
family
working
with
mother
teenage
daughter
and
small
son
if
the
mother
wasn
on
methadone
she
be
on
the
streets
trying
to
pay
for
her
habit
the
kids
are
better
off
they
be
better
off
away
from
their
mother
by
the
sound
of
it
said
miles
and
where
exactly
would
you
propose
they
go
decent
foster
home
would
be
good
start
said
miles
do
you
know
how
many
foster
there
are
against
how
many
kids
needing
them
asked
kay
the
best
solution
would
have
been
to
have
them
adopted
at
birth
ll
in
my
time
machine
kay
well
we
know
couple
who
were
desperate
to
said
samantha
unexpectedly
throwing
her
weight
behind
miles
she
would
not
forgive
kay
for
the
rude
plate
the
woman
was
and
patronizing
exactly
like
who
had
every
get
together
with
her
views
and
her
job
in
family
law
samantha
for
bra
shop
adam
and
she
reminded
miles
in
who
nodded
and
they
couldn
get
baby
for
love
nor
money
could
they
yes
baby
said
kay
her
eyes
everybody
wants
baby
robbie
nearly
four
he
not
he
behind
for
his
age
and
he
almost
certainly
had
inappropriate
exposure
to
sexual
behaviour
would
your
friends
like
to
him
but
the
point
is
if
he
been
taken
from
his
mother
at
birth
she
was
off
the
drugs
when
he
was
born
and
making
good
progress
said
kay
she
loved
him
and
wanted
to
keep
him
and
she
was
meeting
his
needs
at
the
time
she
already
raised
krystal
with
some
family
support
krystal
shrieked
samantha
oh
my
god
are
we
talking
about
the
weedons
kay
was
horrified
that
she
had
used
names
it
had
never
mattered
in
london
but
everyone
truly
did
know
everyone
in
pagford
it
seemed
shouldn
have
but
miles
and
samantha
were
laughing
and
mary
looked
tense
kay
who
had
not
touched
her
pie
and
had
managed
very
little
of
the
first
course
realized
that
she
had
drunk
too
much
she
had
been
wine
steadily
out
of
nerves
and
now
she
had
prime
still
it
was
too
late
to
that
anger
every
other
krystal
weedon
is
no
for
that
woman
skills
said
miles
krystal
trying
her
to
hold
her
family
together
said
kay
she
her
little
brother
very
much
she
terrified
he
ll
be
taken
away
wouldn
trust
krystal
weedon
to
look
after
boiling
egg
said
miles
and
samantha
laughed
again
oh
look
it
to
her
credit
she
her
brother
but
he
isn
toy
yes
know
that
snapped
kay
remembering
robbie
bottom
but
he
still
loved
krystal
our
daughter
lexie
said
samantha
so
we
ve
seen
different
side
of
her
to
the
one
sure
she
shows
you
look
we
all
know
krystal
had
rough
deal
said
miles
nobody
that
it
the
drug
mother
ve
got
an
issue
with
as
matter
of
fact
she
doing
very
well
on
the
bellchapel
programme
at
the
moment
but
with
her
history
said
miles
it
isn
is
it
to
guess
that
she
ll
if
you
that
rule
across
the
board
you
ought
not
to
have
driving
licence
because
with
your
history
you
re
bound
to
drink
and
drive
again
miles
was
temporarily
but
samantha
said
coldly
think
that
rather
different
thing
do
you
said
kay
it
the
same
yes
well
are
sometimes
the
problem
if
you
ask
me
said
miles
often
what
needed
is
bit
of
common
sense
which
is
the
name
people
usually
give
to
their
kay
according
to
said
sharp
new
voice
making
them
all
is
the
of
the
samantha
stood
at
the
door
into
the
hall
girl
of
around
sixteen
in
tight
jeans
and
shirt
she
was
eating
handful
of
and
looking
rather
pleased
with
herself
everyone
meet
lexie
said
miles
thank
you
for
that
you
re
welcome
said
lexie
and
she
swept
off
upstairs
heavy
silence
sank
over
the
table
without
really
knowing
why
samantha
miles
and
kay
all
glanced
towards
mary
who
looked
as
though
she
might
be
on
the
verge
of
tears
coffee
said
samantha
to
her
feet
mary
disappeared
into
the
bathroom
let
go
and
sit
through
said
miles
conscious
that
the
atmosphere
was
somewhat
but
confident
that
he
could
with
few
jokes
and
his
everyone
back
into
charity
with
each
other
bring
your
glasses
his
inner
had
been
no
more
by
kay
arguments
than
breeze
can
move
yet
his
feeling
towards
her
was
not
but
rather
he
was
the
least
by
the
constant
of
glasses
but
on
reaching
the
sitting
room
he
realized
how
very
full
his
was
on
some
music
gav
and
ll
go
and
get
those
but
gavin
made
no
move
towards
the
of
in
their
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
kay
to
start
on
him
sure
enough
as
soon
as
miles
had
vanished
from
sight
kay
said
well
thank
you
very
much
gav
thanks
for
all
the
support
gavin
had
drunk
even
more
than
kay
throughout
dinner
enjoying
his
own
private
celebration
that
he
had
not
after
all
been
offered
up
as
sacrifice
to
samantha
he
faced
kay
full
of
courage
born
not
only
of
wine
but
because
he
had
been
treated
for
an
hour
as
somebody
important
and
by
mary
you
seemed
to
be
doing
ok
on
your
own
he
said
indeed
the
little
he
had
permitted
himself
to
hear
of
kay
and
miles
argument
had
given
him
pronounced
sense
of
if
he
had
not
had
mary
to
him
he
might
have
fancied
himself
back
on
that
famous
evening
in
the
identical
dining
room
when
had
told
miles
that
he
all
that
was
wrong
with
and
miles
had
laughed
in
her
face
and
had
lost
her
temper
and
refused
to
stay
for
coffee
it
was
not
very
long
after
that
had
admitted
that
she
was
sleeping
with
an
partner
at
her
firm
and
gavin
to
get
tested
for
don
know
any
of
these
people
said
kay
and
you
haven
done
one
damn
thing
to
make
it
any
easier
for
me
have
you
what
did
you
want
me
to
do
asked
gavin
he
was
calm
by
the
imminent
of
the
mollisons
and
mary
and
by
the
of
he
had
didn
want
an
argument
about
the
fields
don
give
about
the
fields
he
added
it
subject
around
mary
barry
was
fighting
on
the
council
to
keep
the
fields
part
of
pagford
well
then
why
couldn
you
have
told
me
given
me
hint
he
laughed
exactly
as
miles
had
laughed
at
her
before
she
could
the
others
returned
like
the
bearing
samantha
carrying
tray
of
cups
followed
by
mary
holding
the
and
miles
with
kay
kay
saw
the
gold
on
the
box
and
remembered
how
she
had
been
about
tonight
when
she
had
bought
them
she
turned
her
face
away
trying
to
hide
her
anger
with
the
desire
to
shout
at
gavin
and
also
with
sudden
shocking
urge
to
cry
it
been
so
nice
she
heard
mary
say
in
thick
voice
that
suggested
she
too
might
have
been
crying
but
won
stay
for
coffee
don
want
to
be
late
back
declan
bit
bit
at
the
moment
thanks
so
much
sam
miles
it
been
good
to
you
know
well
get
out
for
bit
ll
walk
you
up
the
miles
began
but
gavin
was
talking
firmly
over
him
you
stay
here
miles
ll
see
mary
back
ll
walk
you
up
the
road
mary
it
ll
only
take
five
minutes
it
dark
up
the
top
there
kay
was
barely
breathing
all
her
being
was
concentrated
in
of
miles
samantha
and
fragile
drooping
mary
but
most
of
all
of
gavin
himself
oh
yes
she
heard
herself
saying
as
everybody
seemed
to
look
towards
her
for
permission
you
see
mary
home
gav
she
heard
the
front
door
close
and
gavin
had
gone
miles
was
pouring
kay
coffee
she
watched
the
stream
of
hot
black
liquid
fall
and
felt
suddenly
painfully
alive
to
what
she
had
in
her
life
for
the
man
walking
away
into
the
night
with
another
woman
viii
colin
wall
saw
gavin
and
mary
pass
under
his
study
window
he
recognized
mary
at
once
but
had
to
to
identify
the
man
at
her
side
before
they
moved
out
of
the
cast
by
the
street
light
crouching
half
raised
out
of
his
computer
chair
colin
after
the
figures
as
they
disappeared
into
the
darkness
he
was
shocked
to
his
core
having
taken
it
for
granted
that
mary
was
in
kind
of
that
she
was
receiving
only
women
in
the
sanctuary
of
her
own
home
among
them
tessa
who
was
still
visiting
every
other
day
never
had
it
occurred
to
him
that
mary
might
be
after
dark
least
of
all
with
single
man
he
felt
personally
betrayed
as
though
mary
on
some
level
was
him
had
mary
permitted
gavin
to
see
barry
body
was
gavin
spending
evenings
sitting
in
barry
favourite
seat
by
the
fire
were
gavin
and
mary
could
they
possibly
be
such
things
happened
after
all
every
day
perhaps
perhaps
even
before
barry
death
colin
was
perennially
appalled
by
the
state
of
other
people
he
tried
to
himself
against
by
pushing
himself
to
imagine
the
worst
by
awful
of
and
betrayal
rather
than
waiting
for
the
truth
to
like
through
his
innocent
life
for
colin
was
one
long
against
pain
and
disappointment
and
everybody
apart
from
his
wife
was
an
enemy
until
they
had
otherwise
he
was
half
inclined
to
rush
downstairs
to
tell
tessa
what
he
had
just
seen
because
she
might
be
able
to
give
him
an
explanation
of
mary
night
time
and
to
him
that
his
best
friend
widow
had
been
and
was
still
to
her
husband
he
resisted
the
urge
because
he
was
angry
with
tessa
why
was
she
showing
such
determined
lack
of
interest
in
his
for
the
council
did
she
not
realize
how
tight
his
anxiety
had
gained
over
him
ever
since
he
had
sent
in
his
form
even
though
he
had
expected
to
feel
this
way
the
pain
was
not
diminished
by
anticipation
any
more
than
being
hit
by
train
would
be
less
for
seeing
it
approaching
down
the
colin
merely
suffered
twice
in
the
expectation
and
in
its
his
new
fantasies
around
the
mollisons
and
the
ways
in
which
they
were
likely
to
attack
him
counter
arguments
and
ran
constantly
through
his
mind
he
saw
himself
already
fighting
for
his
reputation
the
edge
of
always
apparent
in
colin
with
the
world
was
becoming
more
pronounced
and
meanwhile
tessa
was
pretending
to
be
oblivious
doing
absolutely
nothing
to
help
the
dreadful
strain
he
knew
that
she
did
not
think
he
ought
to
be
standing
perhaps
she
too
was
terrified
that
howard
mollison
would
open
the
bulging
of
their
past
and
its
ghastly
secrets
for
all
the
pagford
to
pick
over
colin
had
already
made
few
telephone
calls
to
those
whom
barry
had
counted
on
for
support
he
had
been
surprised
and
that
not
one
of
them
had
his
or
him
on
the
issues
without
they
had
expressed
their
profound
sorrow
at
the
loss
of
barry
and
their
intense
dislike
of
howard
mollison
or
tha
great
as
one
of
the
voters
had
called
him
ter
in
is
son
could
stop
when
barry
was
dead
colin
who
had
list
of
pro
fields
talking
had
not
needed
to
to
the
paper
once
so
far
his
main
appeal
as
seemed
to
be
that
he
was
barry
friend
and
that
he
was
not
called
mollison
his
black
and
white
face
was
smiling
at
him
out
of
the
computer
monitor
he
had
been
sitting
here
all
evening
trying
to
his
election
for
which
he
had
decided
to
use
the
same
photograph
as
was
on
the
winterdown
website
full
face
with
slightly
grin
his
forehead
steep
and
shiny
the
image
had
in
its
favour
the
fact
that
it
had
already
been
to
the
public
gaze
and
had
not
brought
down
or
upon
him
powerful
but
beneath
the
photograph
where
the
personal
information
ought
to
have
been
were
only
one
or
two
colin
had
spent
most
of
the
last
two
hours
and
then
words
at
one
point
he
had
managed
to
complete
an
entire
paragraph
only
to
destroy
it
by
with
nervous
unable
to
bear
the
and
solitude
he
jumped
up
and
went
downstairs
tessa
was
lying
on
the
sofa
in
the
sitting
room
apparently
with
the
television
on
in
the
background
how
it
going
she
asked
opening
her
eyes
mary
just
gone
by
walking
up
the
street
with
gavin
hughes
oh
said
tessa
she
said
something
about
going
over
to
miles
and
samantha
earlier
gavin
must
have
been
there
he
probably
walking
her
home
colin
was
appalled
mary
visiting
miles
the
man
who
sought
to
fill
her
husband
shoes
who
stood
in
to
all
that
barry
had
fought
for
what
on
earth
was
she
doing
at
the
mollisons
they
went
with
her
to
the
hospital
you
know
that
said
tessa
sitting
up
with
small
groan
and
stretching
her
short
legs
she
hasn
spoken
to
them
properly
since
she
wanted
to
thank
them
have
you
finished
your
nearly
there
listen
with
the
information
mean
as
far
as
the
personal
information
goes
past
do
you
think
or
limit
it
to
winterdown
don
think
you
need
say
more
than
where
you
work
now
but
why
don
you
ask
minda
she
tessa
she
done
it
herself
yes
said
colin
he
waited
standing
over
her
but
she
did
not
offer
to
help
or
even
to
read
what
he
had
written
so
far
yes
that
good
idea
he
said
more
loudly
ll
get
minda
to
look
over
it
she
her
and
he
left
the
room
full
of
pride
his
wife
could
not
possibly
realize
what
state
he
was
in
how
little
sleep
he
was
getting
or
how
his
stomach
was
itself
from
within
tessa
had
only
pretended
to
be
asleep
mary
and
gavin
footsteps
had
woken
her
ten
minutes
previously
tessa
barely
knew
gavin
he
was
fifteen
years
younger
than
her
and
colin
but
the
main
towards
intimacy
had
always
been
colin
tendency
to
be
of
barry
other
he
been
about
the
insurance
mary
had
told
tessa
on
the
telephone
earlier
he
on
the
phone
to
them
every
day
from
what
can
gather
and
he
keeps
telling
me
not
to
worry
about
oh
god
tessa
if
they
don
pay
out
gavin
will
sort
it
out
for
you
said
tessa
sure
he
will
it
would
have
been
nice
thought
tessa
stiff
and
on
the
sofa
if
she
and
colin
could
have
had
mary
round
to
the
house
to
give
her
change
of
scene
and
make
sure
she
was
eating
but
there
was
one
mary
found
colin
difficult
strain
this
uncomfortable
and
concealed
fact
had
emerged
slowly
in
the
wake
of
barry
death
like
revealed
by
the
tide
it
could
not
have
been
that
mary
wanted
only
tessa
she
away
from
that
colin
might
help
with
anything
and
avoided
talking
to
him
too
long
on
the
telephone
they
had
met
so
often
as
for
years
and
mary
had
never
barry
good
humour
must
have
it
tessa
had
to
manage
the
new
state
of
affairs
with
great
she
had
successfully
persuaded
colin
that
mary
was
in
the
company
of
other
women
the
funeral
had
been
her
one
failure
because
colin
had
mary
as
they
all
left
st
michael
and
tried
to
explain
through
sobs
that
he
was
going
to
stand
for
barry
seat
on
the
council
to
carry
on
barry
work
to
make
sure
barry
tessa
had
seen
mary
shocked
and
expression
and
pulled
him
away
once
or
twice
since
colin
had
stated
his
intention
of
going
over
to
show
mary
all
his
election
to
ask
whether
barry
would
have
of
them
even
an
intention
of
seeking
guidance
from
mary
as
to
how
barry
would
have
the
process
of
for
votes
in
the
end
tessa
had
told
him
firmly
that
he
must
not
mary
about
the
parish
council
he
became
at
this
but
it
was
better
tessa
thought
that
he
should
be
angry
with
her
rather
than
adding
to
mary
distress
or
her
into
as
had
happened
over
the
of
barry
body
the
mollisons
though
said
colin
re
entering
the
room
with
cup
of
tea
he
had
not
offered
tessa
one
he
was
often
in
these
little
ways
too
busy
with
his
own
to
notice
of
all
the
people
for
her
to
have
dinner
with
they
were
against
everything
barry
stood
for
that
bit
said
tessa
anyway
mary
was
never
as
interested
in
the
fields
as
barry
but
colin
only
understanding
of
love
was
of
mary
had
fallen
in
his
ix
and
where
are
you
going
asked
simon
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
tiny
hall
the
front
door
was
open
and
the
glass
porch
behind
him
full
of
shoes
and
coats
was
in
the
bright
saturday
morning
sun
turning
simon
into
his
shadow
up
the
stairs
just
touching
the
one
on
which
andrew
stood
into
town
with
fats
all
finished
is
it
yeah
it
was
lie
but
simon
would
not
bother
to
check
ruth
ruth
she
appeared
at
the
kitchen
door
wearing
an
apron
flushed
with
her
hands
covered
in
what
do
we
need
anything
from
town
what
no
don
think
so
taking
my
bike
are
you
demanded
simon
of
andrew
yeah
was
going
to
leaving
it
at
fats
house
yeah
what
time
do
we
want
him
back
simon
asked
turning
to
ruth
again
oh
don
know
si
said
ruth
the
she
ever
went
in
irritation
with
her
husband
was
on
occasions
when
simon
though
basically
in
good
mood
started
laying
down
the
law
for
the
fun
of
it
andrew
and
fats
often
went
into
town
together
on
the
vague
understanding
that
andrew
would
return
before
it
became
dark
five
clock
then
said
simon
any
later
and
you
re
fine
andrew
replied
he
kept
his
right
hand
in
his
jacket
pocket
clenched
over
tightly
folded
of
paper
aware
of
it
like
the
fear
of
losing
this
piece
of
paper
on
which
was
line
of
written
code
and
number
of
crossed
out
and
heavily
had
been
him
for
week
he
had
been
keeping
it
on
him
at
all
times
and
sleeping
with
it
inside
his
simon
barely
moved
aside
so
that
andrew
had
to
edge
past
him
into
the
porch
his
fingers
over
the
paper
he
was
terrified
that
simon
would
demand
that
he
turn
out
his
pockets
looking
for
cigarettes
then
simon
did
not
answer
andrew
proceeded
into
the
garage
where
he
took
out
the
note
it
and
read
it
he
knew
that
he
was
being
irrational
that
mere
proximity
to
simon
could
not
have
switched
the
papers
but
still
he
made
sure
satisfied
that
all
was
safe
he
it
tucked
it
deeper
into
his
pocket
which
with
then
wheeled
the
racing
bike
out
of
the
garage
and
down
through
the
gate
into
the
lane
he
could
tell
that
his
father
was
watching
him
through
the
glass
door
of
the
porch
hoping
andrew
was
sure
to
see
him
fall
off
or
the
in
some
way
pagford
lay
below
andrew
slightly
hazy
in
the
cool
spring
sun
the
air
fresh
and
andrew
sensed
the
point
at
which
simon
eyes
could
no
longer
follow
him
it
felt
as
though
pressure
had
been
removed
from
his
back
down
the
hill
into
pagford
he
not
touching
the
then
he
turned
into
church
row
halfway
along
the
street
he
slowed
down
and
into
the
drive
of
the
walls
house
taking
care
to
avoid
cubby
car
hello
andy
said
tessa
opening
the
front
door
to
him
hi
mrs
wall
andrew
accepted
the
that
fats
parents
were
laughable
tessa
was
plump
and
plain
her
was
odd
and
her
dress
sense
while
cubby
was
yet
andrew
could
not
help
but
suspect
that
if
the
walls
had
been
his
parents
he
might
have
been
tempted
to
like
them
they
were
so
so
you
never
had
the
feeling
in
their
house
that
the
floor
might
suddenly
give
way
and
you
into
fats
was
sitting
on
the
bottom
putting
on
his
trainers
packet
of
loose
was
clearly
visible
out
of
the
breast
pocket
of
his
jacket
arf
fats
you
want
to
leave
your
father
in
the
garage
andy
yeah
thanks
mrs
wall
she
always
he
reflected
said
your
father
never
your
dad
andrew
knew
that
tessa
simon
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
made
him
pleased
to
the
horrible
shapeless
clothes
she
wore
and
the
cut
fringe
her
dated
from
that
horrific
making
occasion
years
and
years
before
when
six
year
old
fats
had
come
to
spend
saturday
afternoon
at
hilltop
house
for
the
first
time
on
top
of
box
in
the
garage
trying
to
couple
of
old
the
two
boys
had
accidentally
knocked
down
the
contents
of
shelf
andrew
remembered
the
tin
of
falling
onto
the
roof
of
the
car
and
open
and
the
terror
that
had
him
and
his
to
to
his
giggling
friend
what
they
had
brought
upon
themselves
simon
had
heard
the
crash
he
ran
out
to
the
garage
and
on
them
with
his
jaw
making
his
low
animal
noise
before
starting
to
roar
threats
of
physical
his
fists
clenched
inches
from
their
small
faces
fats
had
wet
himself
stream
of
had
down
the
inside
of
his
onto
the
garage
floor
ruth
who
had
heard
the
from
the
kitchen
had
run
from
the
house
to
no
si
si
no
it
was
an
accident
fats
was
white
and
shaking
he
wanted
to
go
home
straight
away
he
wanted
his
mum
tessa
had
arrived
and
fats
had
run
to
her
in
his
sobbing
it
was
the
only
time
in
his
life
that
andrew
had
seen
his
father
at
loss
down
somehow
tessa
had
conveyed
white
hot
fury
without
raising
her
voice
without
threatening
without
she
had
written
out
and
forced
it
into
simon
hand
while
ruth
said
no
no
there
no
need
there
no
need
simon
had
followed
her
to
her
car
trying
to
laugh
it
all
off
but
tessa
had
given
him
look
of
contempt
while
the
still
sobbing
fats
into
the
passenger
seat
and
slammed
the
driver
door
in
simon
smiling
face
andrew
had
seen
his
parents
tessa
was
taking
away
with
her
down
the
hill
into
the
town
something
that
usually
remained
hidden
in
the
house
on
top
of
the
hill
fats
simon
these
days
whenever
he
came
up
to
hilltop
house
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
make
simon
laugh
and
in
return
simon
welcomed
fats
visits
enjoyed
his
jokes
liked
hearing
about
his
still
when
alone
with
andrew
fats
that
simon
was
reckon
she
said
fats
as
they
walked
past
the
old
vicarage
dark
in
the
shadow
of
the
pine
with
covering
its
front
your
mum
asked
andrew
barely
listening
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
what
fats
and
andrew
saw
that
he
was
outraged
fuck
off
sukhvinder
jawanda
oh
yeah
right
andrew
laughed
and
so
beat
later
did
fats
the
bus
into
yarvil
was
crowded
andrew
and
fats
had
to
sit
next
to
each
other
rather
than
in
two
double
seats
as
they
preferred
as
they
passed
the
end
of
hope
street
andrew
glanced
along
it
but
it
was
deserted
he
had
not
run
into
gaia
outside
school
since
the
afternoon
when
they
had
both
secured
saturday
jobs
at
the
copper
kettle
the
café
would
open
the
following
weekend
he
experienced
waves
of
every
time
he
thought
of
it
si
pie
election
campaign
on
is
it
asked
fats
busy
making
roll
ups
one
long
leg
was
stuck
out
at
an
into
the
aisle
of
the
bus
people
were
over
it
rather
than
asking
him
to
move
cubby
it
already
and
he
only
making
his
yeah
he
busy
said
andrew
and
he
bore
without
silent
of
panic
in
the
of
his
stomach
he
thought
of
his
parents
at
the
kitchen
table
as
they
had
been
for
the
past
week
of
box
of
stupid
simon
had
had
printed
at
work
of
the
list
of
talking
ruth
had
helped
simon
which
he
used
as
he
made
telephone
calls
every
evening
to
every
person
he
knew
within
the
boundary
simon
did
all
of
it
with
an
air
of
immense
effort
he
was
tightly
wound
at
home
towards
his
sons
he
might
have
been
burden
that
they
had
the
only
of
conversation
at
meals
was
the
election
with
simon
and
ruth
about
the
ranged
against
simon
they
took
it
very
personally
that
other
were
standing
for
barry
fairbrother
old
seat
and
seemed
to
assume
that
colin
wall
and
miles
mollison
spent
most
of
their
time
together
staring
up
at
hilltop
house
entirely
on
the
man
who
lived
there
andrew
checked
his
pocket
again
for
the
folded
paper
he
had
not
told
fats
what
he
intended
to
do
he
was
afraid
that
fats
might
it
andrew
was
not
sure
how
to
impress
upon
his
friend
the
necessity
for
absolute
secrecy
how
to
remind
fats
that
the
who
had
made
little
boys
piss
themselves
was
still
alive
and
well
and
living
in
andrew
house
cubby
not
too
worried
about
si
pie
said
fats
he
thinks
the
big
is
miles
mollison
yeah
said
andrew
he
had
heard
his
parents
discussing
it
both
of
them
seemed
to
think
that
shirley
had
betrayed
them
that
she
ought
to
have
her
son
from
challenging
simon
this
is
holy
fucking
for
cubby
know
said
fats
cigarette
between
and
he
picking
up
the
for
his
fallen
barry
fairbrother
he
of
into
the
end
of
the
roll
up
with
match
miles
mollison
wife
got
said
fats
an
elderly
woman
sitting
in
front
of
them
turned
her
head
to
glare
at
fats
andrew
began
to
laugh
again
fats
said
loudly
into
the
scowling
crumpled
face
great
big
double
she
turned
her
red
face
slowly
to
face
the
front
of
the
bus
again
andrew
could
barely
breathe
they
got
off
the
bus
in
the
middle
of
yarvil
near
the
and
main
only
shopping
street
and
their
way
through
the
smoking
fats
roll
ups
andrew
had
virtually
no
money
left
howard
mollison
wages
would
be
very
welcome
the
bright
sign
of
the
internet
café
seemed
to
blaze
at
andrew
from
distance
him
on
he
could
not
concentrate
on
what
fats
was
saying
are
you
going
to
he
kept
asking
himself
are
you
going
to
he
did
not
know
his
feet
kept
moving
and
the
sign
was
growing
larger
and
larger
him
at
him
if
find
out
you
ve
breathed
word
about
what
said
in
this
house
ll
skin
you
alive
but
the
the
humiliation
of
having
simon
show
what
he
was
to
the
world
the
it
would
take
on
the
family
when
after
weeks
of
anticipation
and
he
was
as
he
must
be
then
would
come
rage
and
spite
and
determination
to
make
everybody
else
pay
for
his
own
decisions
only
the
previous
evening
ruth
had
said
brightly
the
boys
will
go
through
pagford
and
post
your
for
you
andrew
had
seen
in
his
vision
paul
look
of
horror
and
his
attempt
to
make
eye
contact
with
his
brother
wanna
go
in
here
mumbled
andrew
turning
right
they
bought
with
on
them
and
sat
down
at
different
computers
two
occupied
seats
apart
the
middle
aged
man
on
andrew
right
of
body
and
old
fags
and
kept
andrew
onto
the
internet
and
typed
in
the
name
of
the
website
pagford
parish
council
co
the
bore
the
council
arms
in
blue
and
white
and
picture
of
pagford
that
had
been
taken
from
point
close
to
hilltop
house
with
abbey
against
the
sky
the
site
as
andrew
already
knew
from
looking
at
it
on
school
computer
looked
dated
and
he
had
not
dared
go
near
it
on
his
own
laptop
his
father
might
be
immensely
ignorant
about
the
internet
but
andrew
did
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
simon
might
find
somebody
at
work
who
could
help
him
investigate
once
the
thing
was
done
even
in
this
anonymous
place
there
was
no
avoiding
the
fact
that
today
date
would
be
on
the
or
of
pretending
that
he
had
not
been
in
yarvil
when
it
happened
but
simon
had
never
visited
an
internet
café
in
his
life
and
might
not
be
aware
that
they
the
rapid
of
andrew
heart
was
painful
swiftly
he
down
the
message
board
which
did
not
seem
to
enjoy
lot
of
traffic
there
were
refuse
collection
and
school
in
and
little
every
or
so
was
from
the
administrator
minutes
of
the
last
council
meeting
right
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
was
death
of
barry
fairbrother
this
had
received
views
and
forty
three
then
on
the
second
page
of
the
message
board
he
found
what
he
hoped
to
find
post
from
the
dead
man
couple
of
months
previously
andrew
computing
set
had
been
by
young
supply
teacher
he
had
been
trying
to
look
cool
trying
to
get
the
class
he
shouldn
have
mentioned
at
all
and
andrew
was
quite
sure
that
he
had
not
been
the
only
one
who
went
straight
home
and
looked
them
up
he
pulled
out
the
piece
of
paper
on
which
he
had
written
the
code
he
had
in
odd
moments
at
school
and
brought
up
the
in
page
on
the
council
website
everything
on
the
that
the
site
had
been
set
up
by
an
long
time
ago
that
it
had
never
been
protected
from
the
of
carefully
using
only
his
finger
he
the
line
of
characters
he
read
them
through
twice
making
sure
that
every
was
where
it
should
be
for
second
on
the
his
breathing
then
pressed
return
he
gasped
as
as
small
child
and
had
to
fight
the
urge
to
shout
out
or
punch
the
air
he
had
the
tin
pot
site
at
his
first
attempt
there
on
the
screen
in
front
of
him
were
barry
fairbrother
details
his
name
his
his
entire
andrew
out
the
paper
he
had
kept
under
his
pillow
all
week
and
set
to
work
up
his
next
paragraph
with
its
many
out
and
was
much
more
process
he
had
been
trying
for
that
was
as
impersonal
and
as
possible
for
the
tone
of
broadsheet
journalist
parish
councillor
simon
price
to
stand
on
of
cutting
council
spending
mr
price
is
certainly
no
stranger
to
keeping
down
costs
and
should
be
able
to
give
the
council
the
benefit
of
his
many
useful
he
money
at
home
by
it
with
stolen
goods
most
recently
pc
and
he
is
the
go
to
man
for
any
cut
price
jobs
that
may
need
doing
for
cash
once
management
has
gone
home
at
the
printworks
andrew
read
the
message
through
twice
he
had
been
over
it
time
and
again
in
his
mind
there
were
many
he
could
have
at
simon
but
the
court
did
not
exist
in
which
andrew
could
have
laid
the
real
against
his
father
in
which
he
would
have
presented
as
evidence
memories
of
physical
terror
and
ritual
humiliation
all
he
had
were
the
many
petty
of
the
law
of
which
he
had
heard
simon
and
he
had
selected
these
two
specific
the
stolen
computer
and
the
out
of
hours
jobs
done
on
the
sly
because
both
were
firmly
connected
to
simon
people
at
the
knew
that
simon
did
these
things
and
they
could
have
talked
to
anybody
their
friends
their
families
his
guts
were
the
way
they
did
when
simon
truly
lost
control
and
laid
about
anyone
within
reach
seeing
his
betrayal
in
black
and
white
on
the
screen
was
terrifying
what
the
fuck
are
you
doing
asked
fats
quiet
voice
in
his
ear
the
middle
aged
man
had
gone
fats
had
moved
up
he
was
reading
what
andrew
had
written
fucking
hell
said
fats
andrew
mouth
was
dry
his
hand
lay
on
the
mouse
how
you
get
in
fats
whispered
said
andrew
it
all
on
the
net
their
security
shit
fats
looked
impressed
andrew
was
half
pleased
half
scared
by
the
reaction
you
ve
gotta
keep
this
to
do
one
about
cubby
no
andrew
hand
on
the
mouse
away
from
fats
reaching
fingers
this
ugly
act
of
had
from
the
soup
of
anger
frustration
and
fear
that
had
inside
him
all
his
rational
life
but
he
knew
no
better
way
to
convey
this
to
fats
than
by
saying
not
just
having
laugh
he
read
the
message
through
third
time
then
added
to
the
message
he
could
feel
fats
excitement
beside
him
as
if
they
were
having
another
session
andrew
was
seized
by
desire
to
impress
further
look
he
said
and
he
changed
barry
to
fats
laughed
loudly
andrew
fingers
on
the
mouse
he
rolled
it
sideways
whether
he
would
have
gone
through
with
it
if
fats
had
not
been
watching
he
would
never
know
with
single
new
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
pagford
parish
council
message
board
simon
price
to
stand
for
council
outside
on
the
pavement
they
faced
each
other
with
laughter
slightly
by
what
had
happened
then
andrew
fats
matches
set
fire
to
the
piece
of
paper
on
which
he
had
the
message
and
watched
it
into
fragile
black
which
drifted
onto
the
dirty
pavement
and
vanished
under
passing
feet
andrew
left
yarvil
at
half
past
three
to
be
sure
of
getting
back
to
hilltop
house
before
five
fats
accompanied
him
to
the
bus
stop
and
then
apparently
on
told
andrew
that
he
thought
he
would
stay
in
town
for
bit
after
all
fats
had
made
loose
to
meet
krystal
in
the
shopping
centre
he
back
towards
the
shops
thinking
about
what
andrew
had
done
in
the
internet
café
and
trying
to
his
own
he
had
to
admit
that
he
was
impressed
in
fact
he
felt
somewhat
andrew
had
thought
the
business
through
and
kept
it
to
himself
and
it
all
of
this
was
fats
experienced
of
that
andrew
had
the
plan
without
saying
word
to
him
and
this
led
fats
to
wonder
whether
perhaps
he
ought
not
to
the
nature
of
andrew
attack
on
his
father
was
there
not
something
slippery
and
over
about
it
would
it
not
have
been
more
authentic
to
simon
to
his
face
or
to
take
swing
at
him
yes
simon
was
shit
but
he
was
undoubtedly
an
authentic
shit
he
did
what
he
wanted
when
he
wanted
without
to
or
conventional
fats
asked
himself
whether
his
ought
not
to
lie
with
simon
whom
he
liked
with
crude
humour
on
people
making
of
themselves
or
injuries
fats
often
told
himself
that
he
would
rather
have
simon
with
his
his
picking
of
worthy
an
than
cubby
on
the
other
hand
fats
had
not
forgotten
the
falling
tin
of
simon
face
and
fists
the
terrifying
noise
he
had
made
the
sensation
of
hot
wet
piss
running
down
his
own
legs
and
perhaps
most
of
all
his
whole
hearted
desperate
yearning
for
tessa
to
come
and
take
him
away
to
safety
fats
was
not
yet
so
that
he
was
to
andrew
desire
for
so
fats
came
full
circle
andrew
had
done
something
daring
and
in
its
consequences
again
fats
experienced
small
of
that
it
had
not
been
he
who
had
thought
of
it
he
was
trying
to
rid
himself
of
his
own
acquired
middle
class
on
words
but
it
was
difficult
to
at
which
he
and
as
he
the
polished
of
the
shopping
centre
he
found
himself
turning
phrases
that
would
blow
cubby
self
important
apart
and
strip
him
naked
before
public
he
spotted
krystal
among
small
crowd
of
fields
kids
grouped
around
the
in
the
middle
of
the
between
shops
nikki
leanne
and
dane
tully
were
among
them
fats
did
not
nor
appear
to
gather
himself
in
the
slightest
but
continued
to
walk
at
the
same
speed
his
hands
in
his
pockets
into
the
of
curious
eyes
him
from
the
top
of
his
head
to
his
trainers
all
righ
called
leanne
all
right
responded
fats
leanne
muttered
something
to
nikki
who
krystal

in
her
cheeks
throwing
back

krystal
chewing
her
gum
glancing
sideways
at
fats

did
not
either
of
them
but
indicated
the
exit
of
the
shopping
centre
with
of
his
krystal
said
loudly
to
the
rest
fats
gave
them
careless
half
raised
hand
in
farewell
and
walked
away
krystal
striding
along
beside
him
he
heard
more
laughter
in
their
wake
but
did
not
care
he
knew
that
he
had
himself
well
where
re
we
asked
krystal
dunno
said
fats
where
you
usually
go
she
walking
and
chewing
they
left
the
shopping
centre
and
walked
on
down
the
high
street
they
were
some
distance
from
the
ground
where
they
had
previously
gone
to
find
privacy
mum
really
drop
yeh
krystal
asked
course
she
bloody
didn
got
the
bus
in
didn
krystal
accepted
the
without
rancour
glancing
sideways
into
the
shop
windows
at
their
and
strange
fats
was
school
even
dane
thought
he
was
funny
he
on
yeh
yeh
stupid
bitch
had
spat
at
her
three
days
ago
on
the
corner
of
foley
road
because
yer
fuckin
whore
like
yer
mum
had
been
member
of
krystal
until
the
two
of
them
had
over
another
boy
was
not
quite
right
in
the
head
she
was
to
of
rage
and
tears
and
divided
most
of
her
time
between
learning
support
and
guidance
when
at
winterdown
if
further
were
needed
of
her
to
think
through
consequences
she
had
krystal
on
her
home
where
krystal
had
back
up
and
she
had
none
nikki
and
leanne
had
helped
corner
and
hold
and
krystal
had
and
slapped
her
everywhere
she
could
reach
until
her
knuckles
came
away
bloody
from
the
other
girl
mouth
krystal
was
not
worried
about
soft
as
an
twice
as
she
said
of
and
her
family
but
words
had
place
in
krystal
so
it
had
been
to
her
when
fats
had
sought
her
out
at
school
the
next
day
and
asked
her
for
the
first
time
to
meet
him
over
the
weekend
she
had
told
nikki
and
leanne
immediately
that
she
was
going
out
with
fats
wall
on
saturday
and
had
been
by
their
looks
of
surprise
and
to
cap
it
all
he
had
turned
up
when
he
had
said
he
would
or
within
half
an
hour
of
it
right
in
front
of
all
her
mates
and
walked
away
with
her
it
was
like
they
were
properly
going
out
so
what
ve
you
been
up
to
fats
asked
after
they
had
walked
fifty
yards
in
silence
back
past
the
internet
café
he
knew
conventional
need
to
keep
some
form
of
going
even
while
he
wondered
whether
they
would
find
private
place
before
the
half
hour
walk
away
he
wanted
to
her
while
they
were
both
he
was
curious
to
know
what
that
was
like
bin
ter
see
my
nana
in
hospital
this
she
ad
stroke
said
krystal
nana
cath
had
not
tried
to
speak
this
time
but
krystal
thought
she
had
known
that
she
was
there
as
krystal
had
expected
terri
was
refusing
to
visit
so
krystal
had
sat
beside
the
bed
on
her
own
for
an
hour
until
it
was
time
to
leave
for
the
fats
was
curious
about
the
of
krystal
life
but
only
in
so
far
as
she
was
an
point
to
the
real
life
of
the
fields
such
as
hospital
visits
were
of
no
interest
to
him
an
krystal
added
with
an
of
pride
ve
gave
an
interview
to
the
paper
what
said
fats
startled
why
jus
about
the
fields
said
krystal
what
it
like
up
there
the
journalist
had
found
her
at
home
at
last
and
when
terri
had
given
her
grudging
permission
taken
her
to
café
to
talk
she
had
kept
asking
her
whether
being
at
st
thomas
had
helped
krystal
whether
it
had
changed
her
life
in
any
way
she
had
seemed
little
impatient
and
by
krystal
how
are
your
marks
at
school
she
had
said
and
krystal
had
been
and
mr
fairbrother
said
that
he
thought
it
your
krystal
did
not
know
what
to
say
about
when
she
thought
of
st
thomas
it
was
of
her
delight
in
the
playing
field
with
the
big
tree
which
enormous
glossy
on
them
every
year
she
had
never
seen
before
she
went
to
st
thomas
she
had
liked
the
uniform
at
first
liked
looking
the
same
as
everybody
else
she
had
been
excited
to
see
her
great
grandfather
name
on
the
war
memorial
in
the
middle
of
the
square
weedon
only
one
other
boy
had
his
on
the
war
memorial
and
that
was
son
who
had
been
able
to
drive
at
nine
and
who
had
once
brought
into
class
for
show
and
tell
krystal
had
never
forgotten
the
sensation
of
the
under
her
hand
when
she
told
nana
cath
about
it
nana
cath
had
said
that
their
family
had
been
once
krystal
had
loved
the
river
green
and
where
they
had
gone
for
nature
best
of
all
had
been
and
she
was
always
first
to
be
picked
for
any
kind
of
team
and
she
had
delighted
in
the
groan
that
went
up
from
the
other
team
whenever
she
was
chosen
and
she
thought
sometimes
of
the
special
teachers
she
had
been
given
especially
miss
who
had
been
young
and
with
long
blonde
hair
krystal
had
always
imagined
anne
to
be
little
bit
like
miss
then
there
were
of
information
that
krystal
had
retained
in
vivid
accurate
detail
they
were
made
by
plates
in
the
ground
they
had
made
model
ones
and
filled
them
with
of
and
washing
up
liquid
and
they
had
erupted
onto
plastic
trays
krystal
had
loved
that
she
knew
about
too
they
had
and
though
she
had
forgotten
when
they
arrived
in
or
why
but
other
memories
of
st
thomas
included
the
muttered
comments
made
about
her
by
little
girls
in
her
class
one
or
two
of
whom
she
had
slapped
when
social
services
had
allowed
her
to
go
back
to
her
mother
her
uniform
became
so
tight
short
and
that
letters
were
sent
from
school
and
nana
cath
and
terri
had
big
row
the
other
girls
at
school
had
not
wanted
her
in
their
except
for
their
she
could
still
remember
lexie
mollison
handing
everyone
in
the
class
little
pink
containing
party
invitation
and
walking
past
krystal
with
as
krystal
remembered
it
her
nose
in
the
air
only
couple
of
people
had
asked
her
to
parties
she
wondered
whether
fats
or
his
mother
remembered
that
she
had
once
attended
birthday
party
at
their
house
the
whole
class
had
been
invited
and
nana
cath
had
bought
krystal
party
dress
so
she
knew
that
fats
huge
back
garden
had
and
swing
and
an
tree
they
had
eaten
and
had
sack
tessa
had
told
krystal
off
because
trying
desperately
hard
to
win
plastic
she
had
pushed
other
children
out
of
the
way
one
of
them
had
had
you
enjoyed
st
thomas
though
did
you
the
journalist
had
asked
yeah
said
krystal
but
she
knew
that
she
had
not
conveyed
what
mr
fairbrother
had
wanted
her
to
convey
and
wished
he
could
have
been
there
with
her
to
help
yeah
enjoyed
it
how
come
they
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
the
fields
asked
fats
it
were
mr
fairbrother
idea
said
krystal
after
another
few
minutes
fats
asked
you
smoke
wha
like
yeah
with
dane
ve
got
some
on
me
said
fats
get
it
off
asked
krystal
he
wondered
whether
he
imagined
trace
of
amusement
in
her
voice
because
was
the
soft
safe
option
the
place
the
middle
class
kids
went
if
so
fats
liked
her
authentic
where
you
get
yours
then
he
asked
interested
now
dunno
it
were
dane
she
said
from
obbo
suggested
fats
tha
fuckin
what
wrong
with
him
but
krystal
had
no
words
for
what
was
wrong
with
obbo
and
even
if
she
had
she
would
not
have
wanted
to
talk
about
him
obbo
made
her
flesh
sometimes
he
came
round
and
shot
up
with
terri
at
other
times
he
fucked
her
and
krystal
would
meet
him
on
the
stairs
up
his
filthy
fly
smiling
at
her
through
his
bottle
bottom
glasses
often
obbo
had
little
jobs
to
offer
terri
like
hiding
the
computers
or
giving
strangers
place
to
stay
for
night
or
to
services
of
which
krystal
did
not
know
the
nature
but
which
took
her
mother
out
of
the
house
for
hours
krystal
had
had
nightmare
not
long
ago
in
which
her
mother
had
become
stretched
spread
and
tied
on
kind

it

not
attended
either
her
monday
or
her
wednesday
morning
guidance
sessions
with
tessa
she
did
not
know
why
sometimes
you
got
out
of
the
habit
she
glanced
sideways
at
fats
again
she
had
never
once
thought
of
him
not
until
he
had
her
at
the
disco
in
the
drama
hall
everyone
knew
fats
some
of
his
jokes
were
passed
around
like
funny
stuff
that
happened
on
the
krystal
pretended
to
everyone
that
they
had
television
at
home
she
watched
enough
at
friends
houses
and
at
nana
cath
to
be
able
to
her
way
through
yeah
it
were
shit
weren
it

nearly
pissed
she
would
say
when
the
others
talked
about
they
had
seen
fats
was
imagining
how
it
would
feel
to
be
how
the
would
through
the
flesh
on
his
face
he
could
feel
the
nerves
and
the
of
the
air
against
his
ripped
skin
the
warm
as
blood
he
felt
over
in
the
skin
around
his
mouth
as
if
it
was
already
is
he
still
carrying
blade
dane
he
asked
you

demanded
krystal
he
threatened
with
it
oh
yeah
krystal
yeah
he
is
said
fats
dane
on
the
brothers
said
krystal
fats
liked
the
matter
of
of
krystal
tone
her
acceptance
of
the
need
for
knife
because
there
was
grudge
and
of
violence
this
was
the
reality
of
life
these
were
things
that
actually
mattered
before
arf
had
arrived
at
the
house
that
day
cubby
had
been
tessa
to
give
him
an
opinion
on
whether
his
campaign
should
be
printed
on
yellow
or
white
paper
what
about
in
there
suggested
fats
after
while
to
their
right
was
long
stone
wall
its
gates
open
to
reveal
glimpse
of
green
and
stone
yeah
all
righ
said
krystal
she
had
been
in
the
once
before
with
nikki
and
leanne
they
had
sat
on
grave
and
split
couple
of
little
self
conscious
about
what
they
were
doing
until
woman
had
shouted
at
them
and
called
them
names
leanne
had
an
empty
can
back
at
the
woman
as
they
left
but
it
was
too
exposed
fats
thought
as
he
and
krystal
walked
up
the
broad
between
the
green
and
flat
the
offering
virtually
no
cover
then
he
saw
hedges
along
the
wall
on
the
far
side
he
cut
path
right
across
the
and
krystal
followed
hands
in
her
pockets
as
they
picked
their
way
between
rectangular
beds
cracked
and
it
was
large
wide
and
well
tended
gradually
they
reached
the
of
highly
polished
black
with
gold
places
where
fresh
flowers
had
been
laid
for
the
recently
dead
to
march
sleep
tight
mum
yeah
we
ll
be
all
right
in
there
said
fats
the
dark
gap
between
the
yellow
bushes
and
the
wall
they
into
the
damp
shadows
onto
the
earth
their
backs
against
the
cold
wall
the
marched
away
from
them
between
the
bushes
but
there
were
no
human
forms
among
them
fats
skinned
up
hoping
that
krystal
was
watching
and
was
impressed
but
she
was
gazing
out
under
the
of
glossy
dark
leaves
thinking
about
anne
who
aunt
cheryl
had
told
her

come
to
visit

many
times
about
how

would
meet
anne

her
yer

these
fantasies

and
eventually
anne
suggested
that
krystal
move
in
the
anne

house

cath

and
clean
