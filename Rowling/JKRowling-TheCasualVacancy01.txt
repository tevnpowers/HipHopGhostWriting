the
went
up
and
well
kept
due
in
large
part
to
the
co
efforts
of
those
whose
faced
onto
it
window
boxes
hanging
and
were
about
planted
in
agreed
colours
each
year
the
black
canon
one
of
the
oldest
in
england
faced
mollison
and
lowe
across
the
square
howard
strode
in
and
out
of
the
back
room
fetching
long
rectangular
containing
fresh
and
laying
them
with
their
bright
of
and
neatly
beneath
the
glass
counter
little
from
coming
on
top
of
so
much
early
morning
conversation
howard
set
the
last
of
the
down
and
stood
for
little
while
looking
out
at
the
war
memorial
in
the
middle
of
the
square
pagford
was
as
lovely
as
ever
this
morning
and
howard
knew
moment
of
in
the
existence
both
of
himself
and
of
the
town
to
which
he
belonged
as
he
saw
it
like
heart
he
was
here
to
drink
it
all
in
the
glossy
black
the
red
and
purple
flowers
the
sunlight
the
top
of
the
stone
cross
and
barry
fairbrother
was
gone
it
was
difficult
not
to
sense
greater
in
this
sudden
of
what
howard
saw
as
the
across
which
he
and
barry
had
faced
each
other
for
so
long
howard
said
maureen
sharply
howard
woman
was
striding
across
the
square
thin
black
haired
brown
skinned
woman
in
coat
who
was
scowling
at
her
feet
as
she
walked
you
think
she
has
she
heard
whispered
maureen
don
know
said
howard
maureen
who
had
still
not
found
time
to
change
into
her
dr
nearly
turned
an
as
she
backed
away
from
the
windows
in
and
hurried
behind
the
counter
howard
walked
slowly
to
occupy
the
space
behind
the
till
like
moving
to
his
post
the
bell
tinkled
and
dr
parminder
jawanda
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
delicatessen
still
she
did
not
acknowledge
howard
or
maureen
but
made
her
way
directly
to
the
shelf
of
maureen
eyes
followed
her
with
the
and
attention
of
watching
field
mouse
morning
said
howard
when
parminder
approached
the
counter
with
bottle
in
her
hand
morning
dr
jawanda
rarely
looked
him
in
the
eye
either
at
parish
council
meetings
or
when
they
met
outside
the
church
hall
howard
was
always
amused
by
her
to
her
dislike
it
made
him
and
not
at
work
today
no
said
parminder
rummaging
in
her
maureen
could
not
contain
herself
dreadful
news
she
said
in
her
cracked
voice
about
barry
fairbrother
said
parminder
but
then
what
about
barry
fairbrother
repeated
maureen
what
about
him
parminder
accent
was
still
strong
after
sixteen
years
in
pagford
deep
between
her
eyebrows
gave
her
perennially
intense
look
sometimes
of
sometimes
of
concentration
he
died
said
maureen
gazing
into
the
scowling
face
last
night
howard
just
been
telling
me
parminder
remained
quite
still
with
her
hand
in
her
then
her
eyes
slid
sideways
to
howard
collapsed
and
died
in
the
golf
club
car
park
howard
said
miles
was
there
saw
it
happen
more
seconds
passed
is
this
joke
demanded
parminder
her
voice
hard
and
high
pitched
of
course
it
not
joke
said
maureen
her
own
outrage
who
make
joke
like
that
parminder
set
down
the
oil
with
on
the
glass
counter
and
walked
out
of
the
shop
well
said
maureen
in
an
of
is
this
joke
shock
said
howard
watching
parminder
hurrying
back
across
the
square
her
coat
behind
her
she
ll
be
as
upset
as
the
widow
that
one
mind
you
it
ll
be
interesting
he
added
scratching
at
the
of
his
belly
which
was
often
to
see
what
she
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
but
it
did
not
matter
maureen
knew
exactly
what
he
meant
both
as
they
watched
councillor
jawanda
around
corner
were
contemplating
the
casual
vacancy
and
they
saw
it
not
as
an
empty
space
but
as
pocket
full
of
viii
the
old
vicarage
was
the
last
and
of
the
victorian
houses
in
church
row
it
stood
at
the
very
bottom
in
big
corner
garden
facing
st
michael
and
all
saints
across
the
road
parminder
who
had
run
the
last
few
yards
down
the
street
fumbled
with
the
stiff
lock
on
the
front
door
and
let
herself
inside
she
would
not
believe
it
until
she
heard
it
from
somebody
else
anybody
else
but
the
telephone
was
already
ringing
in
the
kitchen
yes
it
vikram
parminder
husband
was
surgeon
he
worked
at
the
south
west
general
hospital
in
yarvil
and
he
never
usually
called
from
work
parminder
the
receiver
so
tightly
that
her
fingers
hurt
only
heard
by
accident
it
sounds
like
an
ve
asked
to
move
the
up
the
list
better
for
mary
to
know
what
it
was
they
could
be
doing
him
now
right
whispered
parminder
tessa
wall
was
there
he
told
her
call
tessa
yes
said
parminder
all
right
but
when
she
had
hung
up
she
sank
down
into
one
of
the
kitchen
chairs
and
stared
out
of
the
window
into
the
back
garden
without
seeing
it
her
fingers
pressed
to
her
mouth
everything
had
shattered
the
fact
that
it
was
all
still
there
the
walls
and
the
chairs
and
the
children
pictures
on
the
walls
meant
nothing
every
of
it
had
been
apart
and
in
an
instant
and
its
appearance
of
and
solidity
was
laughable
it
would
at
touch
for
everything
was
suddenly
thin
and
she
had
no
control
over
her
thoughts
they
had
broken
apart
too
and
of
memory
and
out
of
sight
again
dancing
with
barry
at
the
walls
new
year
party
and
the
silly
conversation
they
had
had
walking
back
from
the
last
meeting
of
the
parish
council
you
ve
got
cow
faced
house
she
had
told
him
cow
faced
what
does
that
mean
she
couldn
settle
through
the
hall
then
back
into
the
kitchen
where
she
seized
the
telephone
and
called
tessa
wall
who
did
not
pick
up
she
must
be
at
work
parminder
returned
trembling
to
the
kitchen
chair
her
grief
was
so
big
and
wild
it
terrified
her
like
an
evil
that
had
erupted
from
under
the
barry
little
bearded
barry
her
friend
her
it
was
exactly
the
way
her
father
had
died
she
had
been
fifteen
and
they
had
come
back
from
town
to
find
him
lying
face
down
on
the
lawn
with
the
beside
him
the
sun
hot
on
the
back
of
his
head
parminder
hated
sudden
death
the
long
away
that
so
many
people
feared
was
prospect
to
her
time
to
arrange
and
time
to
say
goodbye
her
hands
were
still
pressed
tightly
over
her
mouth
she
stared
at
the
grave
sweet
of
to
the
board
vikram
did
not
like
the
picture
what
that
doing
there
like
it
she
had
said
defiantly
barry
dead
she
down
the
awful
urge
to
cry
with
that
her
mother
had
always
especially
in
the
wake
of
her
father
death
when
her
other
daughters
and
the
and
cousins
were
all
and
beating
their
breasts
and
you
were
his
favourite
too
but
parminder
kept
her
tears
locked
tightly
inside
where
they
seemed
to
an
returning
to
the
world
as
of
rage
at
her
children
and
the
at
work
she
could
still
see
howard
and
maureen
behind
the
counter
the
one
immense
the
other
and
in
her
mind
eye
they
were
looking
down
at
her
from
height
as
they
told
her
that
her
friend
was
dead
with
an
almost
welcome
of
fury
and
hatred
she
thought
they
re
glad
they
think
they
ll
win
now
she
jumped
up
again
strode
back
into
the
sitting
room
and
took
down
from
the
top
shelf
one
of
the
her
brand
new
holy
book
opening
it
at
she
read
with
no
surprise
but
rather
sense
of
looking
at
her
own
face
in
mirror
mind

world
is
deep
dark
on
every
side

head
of

and
wife
of
the
deputy
headmaster
entered
the
room
at
half
past
ten
with
and
carrying
cup
of
strong
instant
coffee
that
she
had
brought
up
from
the
staff
room
she
was
short
woman
with
plain
wide
face
who
cut
her
own
greying
hair
the
fringe

often
little
wore
clothes
of
variety
and
liked
jewellery
of
and
wood
today
long
skirt
might
have
been
made
of
and
she
had
it
with
thick
cardigan
in
green
tessa
hardly
ever
looked
at
herself
in
full
length
and
shops
where
this
was
she
had
attempted
to
soften
the
guidance
room
resemblance
to
by
up
hanging
she
had
owned
since
her
student
days
sheet
with
bright
yellow

and

the
rest
of
the
bare
painted
were
covered
with

that
either
gave
helpful
on
self
or
telephone
numbers
to
call
for
anonymous
help
on
variety
of
health
and
emotional
issues
the
headmistress
had
made
slightly
remark
about
these
the
last
time
she
had
visited
the
guidance
room
and
if
all
else
they
call
see
she
had
said
pointing
to
the
most
tessa
sank
into
her
chair
with
low
groan
took
off
her
which
and
placed
it
on
the
desk
beside
various
printed
sheets
and
notes
she
doubted
that
progress
along
the
lines
would
be
possible
today
she
doubted
even
whether
krystal
weedon
would
turn
up
krystal
frequently
walked
out
of
school
when
upset
angry
or
bored
she
was
sometimes
before
she
reached
the
gates
and
marched
back
inside
swearing
and
shouting
at
other
times
she
successfully
and
escaped
into
days
of
ten
forty
arrived
the
bell
sounded
and
tessa
waited
krystal
burst
in
through
the
door
at
ten
fifty
one
and
slammed
it
behind
her
she
slumped
down
in
front
of
tessa
with
her
arms
folded
across
her
her
cheap
swinging
you
can
tell
your
she
said
her
voice
trembling
that
never
fuckin
laughed
all
right
don
swear
at
me
please
krystal
said
tessa
never
laughed
all
right
screamed
krystal
group
of
sixth
carrying
had
arrived
in
the
library
they
glanced
through
the
glass
in
the
door
one
of
them
at
the
sight
of
the
back
of
krystal
head
tessa
got
up
and
let
down
the
over
the
window
then
returned
to
her
seat
in
front
of
the
moon
and
sun
all
right
krystal
why
don
you
tell
me
what
happened
your
said
fairbrother
right
an
couldn
hear
what
he
was
saying
right
so
nikki

and
couldn
fucking
krystal
couldn
believe
it
right
an
shouted
but
never
laughed
never
fuck
krystal
never
laughed
all
right
shouted
krystal
arms
tight
across
her
chest
legs
twisted
together
all
right
krystal
tessa
was
used
to
the
anger
of
students
she
saw
most
often
in
guidance
many
of
them
were
of
they
lied
and
and
yet
their
fury
when
accused
was
and
genuine
tessa
thought
she
recognized
this
as
authentic
outrage
as
opposed
to
the
kind
that
krystal
was
at
in
any
case
the
tessa
had
heard
during
assembly
had
struck
her
at
the
time
as
one
of
shock
and
rather
than
amusement
tessa
had
been
filled
with
dread
when
colin
had
identified
it
as
laughter
seen
cubby
krystal
your
fuckin
krystal
for
the
last
time
please
do
not
swear
at
me
told
im
never
laughed
told
im
an
he
still
gave
me
fucking
tears
of
fury
in
the
girl
heavily
eyes
blood
had
flowed
into
her
face
pink
she
glared
at
tessa
to
run
to
swear
to
give
tessa
the
finger
too
nearly
two
years
of
fine
trust
between
them
was
stretching
on
the
point
of
believe
you
krystal
believe
you
didn
laugh
but
please
do
not
swear
at
me
suddenly
fingers
were
the
eyes
tessa
pulled
of
tissues
from
out
of
her
desk
drawer
and
handed
them
across
to
krystal
who
grabbed
them
without
thanks
pressed
them
to
each
eye
and
blew
her
nose
krystal
hands
were
the
most
touching
part
of
her
the
were
short
and
broad
painted
and
all
her
hand
were
as
naive
and
direct
as
small
child
tessa
waited
until
krystal
had
slowed
down
then
she
said
can
tell
you
re
upset
that
mr
fairbrother
has
died
yer
am
said
krystal
with
considerable
so
tessa
had
sudden
mental
image
of
barry
listening
in
to
this
conversation
she
could
see
his
smile
she
heard
him
quite
clearly
saying
her
heart
tessa
closed
her
eyes
unable
to
speak
she
heard
krystal
counted
slowly
to
ten
and
opened
her
eyes
again
krystal
was
staring
at
her
arms
still
folded
flushed
and
looking
very
sorry
about
mr
fairbrother
too
said
tessa
he
was
an
old
friend
of
actually
that
the
reason
mr
wall
is
bit
told
im
never
krystal
please
let
me
finish
mr
wall
is
very
upset
today
and
that
probably
why
he
why
he
what
you
did
ll
speak
to
him
he
won
change
his
fuck
krystal
well
he
won
krystal
the
leg
of
tessa
desk
with
her
foot
beating
out
rapid
tessa
removed
her
from
the
desk
so
as
not
to
feel
the
and
said
ll
speak
to
mr
wall
she
adopted
what
she
believed
was
expression
and
waited
patiently
for
krystal
to
come
to
her
krystal
sat
in
silence
kicking
the
table
leg
regularly
what
was
wrong
with
mr
fairbrother
she
said
at
last
they
think
an
burst
in
his
brain
said
tessa
why
did
it
he
was
born
with
he
didn
know
about
said
tessa
tessa
knew
that
krystal
with
sudden
death
was
greater
than
her
own
people
in
krystal
mother
circle
died
with
such
that
they
might
have
been
involved
in
some
secret
war
of
which
the
rest
of
the
world
knew
nothing
krystal
had
told
tessa
how
when
she
was
six
years
old
she
had
found
the
corpse
of
an
unknown
young
man
in
her
mother
bathroom
it
had
been
the
for
one
of
her
many
into
the
care
of
her
nana
cath
nana
cath
large
in
many
of
krystal
stories
about
her
childhood
strange
mixture
of
and
our
ll
be
fucked
now
said
krystal
no
it
won
said
tessa
and
don
swear
krystal
please
it
will
said
krystal
tessa
wanted
to
her
but
the
impulse
was
by
exhaustion
krystal
was
right
anyway
said
rational
part
of
tessa
brain
the
rowing
eight
would
be
finished
nobody
except
barry
could
have
brought
krystal
weedon
into
any
group
and
kept
her
there
she
would
leave
tessa
knew
it
probably
krystal
knew
it
herself
they
sat
for
while
without
speaking
and
tessa
was
too
tired
to
find
words
that
might
have
changed
the
atmosphere
between
them
she
felt
exposed
skinned
to
the
bone
she
had
been
awake
for
over
twenty
four
hours
samantha
mollison
had
telephoned
from
the
hospital
at
ten
clock
just
as
tessa
was
emerging
from
long
in
the
bath
to
watch
the
news
she
had
scrambled
back
into
her
clothes
while
colin
made
noises
and
into
the
furniture
they
had
called
upstairs
to
tell
their
son
where
they
were
going
then
run
out
to
the
car
colin
had
driven
far
too
fast
into
yarvil
as
though
he
might
bring
barry
back
if
he
could
do
the
journey
in
record
time
reality
and
it
into
itself
if
you
ain
gonna
talk
to
me
ll
go
said
krystal
don
be
rude
please
krystal
said
tessa
very
tired
this
morning
mr
wall
and
were
at
the
hospital
last
night
with
mr
fairbrother
wife
they
re
good
friends
of
mary
had
completely
when
she
had
seen
tessa
her
arms
around
her
her
face
in
tessa
neck
with
dreadful
even
as
tessa
own
tears
began
to
down
mary
narrow
back
she
thought
quite
that
the
noise
mary
was
making
was
called
the
body
that
tessa
had
so
often
and
had
in
her
arms
barely
able
to
contain
the
grief
it
was
being
asked
to
bear
tessa
could
not
remember
miles
and
samantha
leaving
she
did
not
know
them
very
well
she
supposed
that
they
had
been
glad
to
go
seen
is
wife
said
krystal
blonde
woman
she
come
to
see
us
yes
said
tessa
krystal
was
chewing
on
the
of
her
fingers
he
were
gonna
get
me

of

aloud
of
delight
and
admiration

had
been
the
guidance

had
ever
known

going

when

krystal
at

and
tessa
could
not
the
energy
to
break
the
silence
that
around
them
the
of
barry
death
on
the
parish
council
website
sank
with
barely
tiny
into
the
all
the
same
the
telephone
lines
in
pagford
were
than
usual
this
monday
and
little
of
kept
on
the
narrow
to
check
in
shocked
the
of
their
information
as
the
news
travelled
an
odd
took
place
it
happened
to
the
signature
the
files
in
barry
office
and
to
the
of
his
enormous
which
began
to
take
on
the
of
the
of
lost
boy
in
these
rapid
the
arranged
by
fingers
forever
still
acquired
the
of
gavin
was
already
little
by
the
sight
of
his
dead
friend
on
his
phone
and
one
of
the
girls
from
the
rowing
eight
still
crying
as
she
walked
back
from
assembly
found
form
that
barry
had
signed
in
her
school
bag
and
became
almost
the
twenty
three
year
old
journalist
at
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette
had
no
idea
that
barry
once
busy
brain
was
now
heavy
handful
of
on
metal
tray
in
south
west
general
she
read
through
what
he
had
emailed
her
an
hour
before
his
death
then
called
his
mobile
number
but
nobody
answered
barry
phone
which
he
had
turned
off
at
mary
request
before
they
left
for
the
golf
club
was
sitting
silently
beside
the
in
the
kitchen
along
with
the
rest
of
his
personal
that
the
hospital
had
given
her
to
take
home
nobody
had
touched
them
these
familiar
objects
his
key
his
phone
his
worn
old
seemed
like
pieces
of
the
dead
man
himself
they
might
have
been
his
fingers
his
lungs
onwards
and
the
news
of
barry
death
spread
like
from
those
who
had
been
at
the
hospital
onwards
and
as
far
as
yarvil
reaching
those
who
knew
barry
only
by
sight
or
reputation
or
by
name
gradually
the
facts
lost
form
and
focus
in
some
cases
they
became
in
places
barry
himself
was
lost
behind
the
nature
of
his
ending
and
he
became
no
more
than
an
of
vomit
and
piss
pile
of
and
it
seemed
even
that
man
should
have
died
so
at
the
little
golf
club
so
it
was
that
simon
price
who
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
hear
about
barry
death
in
his
house
on
top
of
the
hill
pagford
met
at
the
printworks
in
yarvil
where
he
had
worked
ever
since
leaving
school
it
was
borne
to
him
on
the
lips
of
young
gum
chewing
driver
whom
simon
found
beside
his
office
door
after
late
afternoon
return
from
the
bathroom
the
boy
had
not
come
in
the
first
place
to
discuss
barry
at
all
that
thing
you
said

be
rested
in
he
mumbled
when
he
had
followed
simon
into
the
office
and
simon
had
closed
the
door
do
it
for
yeh
wednesday
if
yeh

vigorously
simon

working
gum

one
of
simon
many
it
the
proper
thing
though
is
it
simon
demanded

some
knock
off
piece
of

the
boy
his
feet
and
his
shoulders
real
thing
still
up

his

simon
where

to
his
home

the
he
not

of
his
privacy
and
possible

saw

as
immaculate
world
apart
from
yarvil
and
the
crashing
printworks

said
simon
ignoring
the
question

mate
simon
thought

be

could
not
the
horrible
idea
by
his
careless
wife
that
morning
that
tiny
might
for
ages
inside
man
brain
the
steady
clatter
and
of
the
press
beyond
the
door
was
surely
not
good
for
him
its
might
have
been
his
walls
for
years
all
right
he
and
rolled
over
in
his
chair

back
pocket

up
to
the
desk
his
hand

his
back
pocket
and
we

wednesday
the
office
door
closed
simon
forgot
his
which
was
really
no
more
than
in
his
fascination
at
the
of
barry
fairbrother
barry
fairbrother
so
busy
and
so
popular
and
and
all
the
time
from
the
news
did
not
simon
as
it
would
have
done
nearly
everybody
else
who
had
known
barry
nor
did
it
barry
in
his
eyes
on
the
he
felt
an
increased
respect
for
the
dead
man
anyone
with
any
was
working
constantly
and
to
as
much
as
they
could
simon
knew
that
he
gazed
at
the
on
his
computer
screen
once
more
to
the
of
the
printworks
beyond
his
dusty
window
there
was
no
choice
but
to
work
from
nine
to
five
if
you
had
family
but
simon
had
always
known
that
there
were
other
better
ways
that
life
of
ease
and
plenty
over
his
head
like
great
bulging
which
he
might
open
if
only
he
had
stick
big
enough
and
the
knowledge
of
when
to
simon
had
the
child
belief
that
the
rest
of
the
world
as
for
their
personal
drama
that
hung
over
him
and
signs
in
his
path
and
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
had
been
sign
had
for
several
apparently
decisions
in
simon
past
years
previously
when
still
at
the
printworks
with
he
could
barely
afford
and
newly
pregnant
wife
he
had
bet
one
hundred
pounds
on
well
national
called
baby
which
had
fallen
at
the
second
last
shortly
after
they
had
bought
hilltop
house
simon
had
twelve
hundred
pounds
which
ruth
had
been
hoping
to
use
for
curtains
and
into
time
share
run
by
fiddling
old
from
yarvil
simon
had
vanished
with
the
company
but
although
he
had
and
and
kicked
his
younger
son
halfway
down
the
stairs
for
getting
in
his
way
he
had
not
the
police
he
had
known
about
certain
in
the
way
the
company
operated
before
he
put
his
money
there
and
he
awkward
questions
set
against
these
though
were
of
luck
that
worked
that
paid
off
and
simon
gave
great
weight
to
these
when
his
they
were
the
reason
that
he
kept
faith
with
his
stars
that
him
in
his
belief
that
the
had
more
in
store
for
him
than
the
mug
game
of
working
for
salary
until
he
retired
or
died
and
short
cuts
leg
ups
and
back
everyone
was
at
it
even
as
it
turned
out
little
barry

there
in
his
office
simon

gazed
on
vacancy
among
the

an
empty
chair
with
no

waiting

charles

baker
local
council
administration
seventh
edition
pagford
parish
council
was
for
its
size
an
impressive
force
it
met
once
month
in
pretty
victorian
church
hall
and
attempts
to
cut
its
any
of
its
or
it
into
some
authority
had
been
and
successfully
resisted
for
of
all
the
local
under
the
higher
authority
of
yarvil
district
council
pagford
itself
on
being
the
most
the
most
and
the
most
independent
until
sunday
evening
it
had
sixteen
local
men
and
women
as
the
town
tended
to
assume
that
wish
to
serve
on
the
parish
council
implied
to
do
so
all
sixteen
councillors
had
gained
their
seats
yet
this
body
was
in
state
of
war
an
issue
that
had
been
causing
fury
and
resentment
in
pagford
for
sixty
odd
years
had
reached
and
had
behind
two
to
grasp
fully
the
cause
of
the
it
was
necessary
to
the
precise
of
pagford
dislike
and
of
the
city
of
yarvil
which
lay
to
its
north
yarvil
shops
and
the
south
west
general
hospital
provided
the
of
the
in
pagford
the
small
town
generally
spent
their
saturday
nights
in
yarvil
and
the
city
had
several
and
two
enormous
shopping
and
these
things
were
pleasant
enough
to
visit
if
you
had
yourself
on
pagford
even
so
to
true
yarvil
was
little
more
than
necessary
evil
their
attitude
was
by
the
high
hill
by
abbey
which
yarvil
from
pagford
sight
and
allowed
the
the
happy
that
the
city
was
many
miles
further
away
than
it
truly
was
ii
it
so
happened
that
hill
also
obscured
from
the
town
view
another
place
but
one
that
pagford
had
always
considered
particularly
its
own
this
was
sweetlove
house
an
coloured
queen
anne
manor
set
in
many
of
park
and
it
lay
within
pagford
parish
halfway
between
the
town
and
yarvil
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
the
house
had
passed
smoothly
from
to
of
until
finally
in
the
early
the
family
had
died
out
all
that
remained
these
days
of
the
long
with
pagford
was
the
in
the
of
st
michael
and
all
saints
and
of
and
initials
over
local
and
like
the
and
of
after
the
death
of
the
last
of
the
the
manor
house
had
changed
hands
with
there
were
constant
fears
in
pagford
that
some
would
buy
and
the
landmark
then
in
the
man
called
aubrey
fawley
the
place
fawley
was
soon
known
to
be
possessed
of
private
which
he
in
mysterious
ways
in
the
city
he
had
four
children
and
desire
to
settle
permanently
pagford
approval
was
raised
to
still
by
the
swiftly
that
fawley
was
descended
through
line
from
the
he
was
clearly
half
local
already
man
whose
natural
would
be
to
pagford
and
not
to
yarvil
old
pagford
believed
that
the
of
aubrey
fawley
meant
the
return
of
he
would
be
to
the
town
like
his
before
him
grace
and
over
their
streets
howard
mollison
could
still
remember
his
mother
into
their
tiny
kitchen
in
hope
street
with
the
news
that
aubrey
had
been
invited
to
judge
the
local
show
her
had
taken
the
prize
three
years
in
row
and
she
to
accept
the
silver
rose
bowl
from
man
who
was
already
to
her
figure
of
old
world
iii
but
then
so
local
told
came
the
sudden
darkness
that
the
appearance
of
the
even
as
pagford
was
that
sweetlove
house
had
fallen
into
such
safe
hands
yarvil
was
of
council
houses
to
its
south
the
new
streets
pagford
learned
with
unease
were
consuming
some
of
the
land
that
lay
between
the
city
and
the
town
everybody
knew
that
there
had
been
an
demand
for
cheap
since
the
war
but
the
little
town
momentarily
by
aubrey
fawley
arrival
began
to
with
of
yarvil
the
natural
of
river
and
hill
that
had
once
been
of
pagford
seemed
diminished
by
the
speed
with
which
the
red
brick
houses
yarvil
filled
every
of
the
land
at
its
and
stopped
at
the
of
pagford
parish
the
town
sighed
with
relief
that
was
soon
revealed
to
be
premature
the
cantermill
estate
was
immediately
judged
to
meet
the
needs
and
the
city
cast
about
for
more
land
to
it
was
then
that
aubrey
fawley
still
more
than
man
to
the
people
of
pagford
made
the
decision
that
sixty
year
grudge
having
no
use
for
the
few
fields
that
lay
beyond
the
new
development
he
sold
the
land
to
yarvil
council
for
good
price
and
used
the
cash
to
the
in
the
hall
of
sweetlove
house
pagford
fury
was
the
sweetlove
fields
had
been
an
important
part
of
its
against
the
city
now
the
ancient
of
the
parish
was
to
be
by
an
of
town
hall
meetings
letters
to
the
newspaper
and
yarvil
council
personal
with
those
in
charge
nothing
succeeded
in
the
tide
the
council
houses
began
to
advance
again
but
with
one
difference
in
the
brief
following
of
the
first
estate
the
council
had
realized
that
it
could
more
the
fresh
was
not
of
red
brick
but
of
in
steel
this
second
estate
was
known
as
the
fields
after
the
land
on
which
it
had
been
built
and
was
marked
as
from
the
cantermill
estate
by
its
and
it
was
in
one
of
the
fields
and
steel
houses
already
and
by
the
late
that
barry
fairbrother
was
born
iv
in
spite
of
yarvil
council
that
of
the
new
estate
would
be
its
own
responsibility
pagford
as
the
furious
had
from
the
first
was
soon
landed
with
new
bills
while
the
of
most
services
to
the
fields
and
the
of
its
houses
fell
to
yarvil
council
there
remained
matters
that
the
city
in
its
way
to
the
parish

lighting
and
public

much
by
and
became
popular
spot
for

and
worse
as
howard
mollison
mother
put
it
it
fell
to
pagford
parish
council
to
clean
to
and
to
replace
and
the
by
yarvil
were
felt
from
the
first
to
be
inadequate
for
the
time
and
required
no
part
of
pagford
burden
caused
more
fury
or
than
the
fact
that
fields
children
now
fell
inside
the
area
of
st
thomas
church
of
england
primary
school
young
fielders
had
the
right
to
don
the
blue
and
white
uniform
to
play
in
the
yard
beside
the
stone
laid
by
lady
sweetlove
and
to
the
tiny
with
their
yarvil
it
swiftly
became
common
in
pagford
that
houses
in
the
fields
had
become
the
prize
and
of
every
benefit
supported
yarvil
family
with
school
age
children
that
there
was
great
across
the
boundary
line
from
the
cantermill
estate
much
as
into
their
beautiful
st
thomas

professional
to
yarvil
who
were
by
the
tiny
classes
the
desks
the
aged
stone
building
and
the
green
playing
field
would
be
and
by
the
of
and
mothers
whose
children
had
all
been
by
different
men
this
had
never
been
fully
realized
because
while
there
were
undoubtedly
to
st
thomas
there
were
also
the
need
to
buy
the
uniform
or
else
to
fill
in
all
the
forms
required
to
for
for
the
same
the
necessity
of
bus
and
of
getting
up
earlier
to
ensure
that
the
children
arrived
at
school
on
time
some
in
the
fields
found
these
and
their
children
were
absorbed
instead
by
the
large
plain

that
had
been
built
to

most
of
the

came
to
st

well
with
their
in
pagford
some
indeed
were
admitted
to
be
perfectly
nice

barry

had
moved

and
clever

only
occasionally
noticing
that
the
smile
of
pagford
parent
when
he
mentioned
the
place
where
he
lived
st
thomas
was
sometimes
forced
to
take
in
fields
of
nature
krystal
weedon
had
been
living
with
her
great
grandmother
in
hope
street
when
the
time
came
for
her
to
start
school
so
that
there
was
really
no
way
of
stopping
her
coming
even
though
when
she
moved
back
to
the
fields
with
her
mother
at
the
age
of
eight
there
were
high
that
she
would
leave
st
thomas
for
good
krystal
slow
passage
up
the
school
had
resembled
the
passage
of
through
the
body
of
being
highly
visible
and
uncomfortable
for
both
parties
concerned
not
that
krystal
was
always
in
class
for
much
of
her
career
at
st
thomas
she
had
been
taught
one
on
one
by
special
teacher
by
stroke
of
fate
krystal
had
been
in
the
same
class
as
howard
and
shirley
eldest
granddaughter
lexie
krystal
had
once
hit
lexie
mollison
so
hard
in
the
face
that
she
had
knocked
out
two
of
her
teeth
that
they
had
already
been
was
not
felt
by
lexie
parents
and
to
be
much
of
an
it
was
the
conviction
that
whole
classes
of
would
be
waiting
for
their
daughters
at
winterdown
comprehensive
that
finally
decided
miles
and
samantha
mollison
on
both
their
daughters
to
st
anne
the
private
girls
school
in
yarvil
where
they
had
become
the
fact
that
his
had
been
driven
out
of
their
places
by
krystal
weedon
swiftly
became
one
of
howard
favourite
of
the
estate
influence
on
pagford
life
the
first
of
pagford
outrage
had
into
but
no
less
powerful
sense
of
the
fields
and
place
of
peace
and
beauty
and
the
remained
determined
to
cut
the
estate
yet
boundary
had
come
and
gone
and
in
local
government
had
swept
the
area
without
any
change
the
fields
remained
part
of
pagford
to
the
town
learned
quickly
that
of
the
estate
was
necessary
to
the
of
that
hard
core
of
who
ran
everything
but
now
at
long
last
over
sixty
years
after
old
aubrey
fawley
had
handed
yarvil
that
of
land
after
of
patient
work
of
and
of
information
and
the
anti
fielders
of
pagford
found
themselves
at
last
on
the
trembling
threshold
of
the
was
forcing
local
to
cut
and
there
were
those
on
the
higher
body
of
yarvil
district
council
who
an
advantage
to
their
if
the
little
estate
likely
to
fare
poorly
under
the
imposed
by
the
national
government
were
to
be
up
and
its
joined
to
their
own
voters
pagford
had
its
own
in
yarvil
district
councillor
aubrey
fawley
this
was
not
the
man
who
had
the
of
the
fields
but
his
son
young
aubrey
who
had
inherited
sweetlove
house
and
who
worked
through
the
week
as
in
london
there
was
whiff
of
in
aubrey
involvement
in
local
affairs
sense
that
he
ought
to
make
right
the
wrong
that
his
father
had
so
done
to
the
little
town
he
and
his
wife
julia
and
gave
out
at
the
show
sat
on
any
number
of
local
and
threw
an
annual
christmas
party
to
which
were
much
it
was
howard
pride
and
delight
to
think
that
he
and
aubrey
were
such
close
in
the
continuing
to
the
fields
to
yarvil
because
aubrey
moved
in
higher
of
that
howard
fascinated
respect
every
evening
after
the
delicatessen
closed
howard
removed
the
tray
of
his
old
till
and
counted
up
and
dirty
notes
before
placing
them
in
safe
aubrey
on
the
other
hand
never
touched
money
during
his
office
hours
and
yet
he
caused
it
to
move
in
across
he
managed
it
and
it
and
when
the
were
less
propitious
he
watched
as
it
vanished
to
howard
aubrey
had
that
not
even
financial
crash
could
the
delicatessen
owner
was
impatient
of
anyone
who
the
likes
of
aubrey
for
the
mess
in
which
the
country
found
itself
nobody
had
complained
when
things
were
going
well
was
howard
repeated
view
and
he
aubrey
the
respect
due
to
general
in
an
war
meanwhile
as
district
councillor
aubrey
was
to
all
of
interesting
and
in
position
to
share
good
deal
of
information
with
howard
about
pagford
the
two
men
knew
exactly
how
much
of
the
district
were
poured
without
return
or
apparent
into
the
fields
streets
that
nobody
owned
their
own
house
in
the
fields
the
red
brick
houses
of
the
cantermill
estate
were
almost
all
in
private
hands
these
days
they
had
been
almost
beyond
recognition
with
window
boxes
and
and
neat
front
that
nearly
two
of
fields
lived
entirely
off
the
state
and
that
passed
through
the
doors
of
the
bellchapel
addiction
clinic
vi
howard
carried
the
mental
image
of
the
fields
with
him
always
like
memory
of
nightmare
boarded
windows
with
smoking
teenagers
in
the
perennially
bus
everywhere
turned
to
the
like
the
of
metal
flowers
he
often
asked
why
they
could
not
have
and
made
the
place
over
what
was
stopping
the
from
their
and
between
the
lot
of
them
but
it
never
happened
the
fields
waited
for
the
district
and
parish
to
clean
to
to
maintain
to
give
and
give
and
give
again
howard
would
then
recall
the
hope
street
of
his
with
its
tiny
back
gardens
each
hardly
more
than
sized
of
earth
but
most
including
his
mother
with
and
potatoes
there
was
nothing
as
far
as
howard
could
see
to
stop
the
fielders
growing
fresh
vegetables
nothing
to
stop
them
their
painting
nothing
to
stop
them
pulling
themselves
together
as
community
and
the
dirt
and
the
nothing
to
stop
them
cleaning
themselves
up
and
taking
jobs
nothing
at
all
so
howard
was
forced
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
they
were
of
their
own
free
will
to
live
the
way
they
lived
and
that
the
estate
air
of
slightly
threatening
was
nothing
more
than
physical
of
and
pagford
by
contrast
shone
with
kind
of
moral
in
howard
mind
as
though
the
soul
of
the
community
was
made
in
its
streets
its
hills
its
houses
to
howard
his
was
much
more
than
collection
of
old
and
fast
flowing
tree
river
the
of
the
abbey
above
or
the
hanging
in
the
square
for
him
the
town
was
an
way
of
being
that
stood
firmly
against
national
pagford
man
he
would
tell
born
and
in
so
saying
he
was
giving
himself
profound
compliment
disguised
as
commonplace
he
had
been
born
in
pagford
and
he
would
die
there
and
he
had
never
dreamed
of
leaving
nor
for
more
change
of
scene
than
could
be
had
from
watching
the
the
and
river
from
watching
the
square
in
spring
or
at
christmas
barry
fairbrother
had
known
all
this
indeed
he
had
said
it
he
had
laughed
right
across
the
table
in
the
church
hall
laughed
right
in
howard
face
you
know
howard
you
are
pagford
to
me
and
howard
not
in
the
slightest
for
he
had
always
met
barry
joke
for
joke
had
said
ll
take
that
as
great
compliment
barry
however
it
was
intended
he
could
afford
to
laugh
the
one
remaining
ambition
of
howard
life
was
within
touching
distance
the
return
of
the
fields
to
yarvil
seemed
imminent
and
certain
then
two
days
before
barry
fairbrother
had
dropped
dead
in
car
park
howard
had
learned
from
an
source
that
his
had
broken
all
known
rules
of
and
had
gone
to
the
local
paper
with
story
about
the
it
had
been
for
krystal
weedon
to
be
at
st
thomas
the
idea
of
krystal
weedon
being
in
front
of
the
reading
public
as
an
example
of
the
successful
of
the
fields
and
pagford
might
so
howard
said
have
been
funny
had
it
not
been
so
serious
doubtless
fairbrother
would
have
the
girl
and
the
truth
about
her
mouth
the
interrupted
classes
the
other
children
in
tears
the
constant
and
would
be
lost
in
lies
howard
trusted
the
good
sense
of
his
fellow
but
he
feared
and
the
interference
of
ignorant
do
his
was
both
and
personal
he
had
not
yet
forgotten
how
his
granddaughter
had
sobbed
in
his
arms
with
bloody
where
her
teeth
had
been
while
he
tried
to
her
with
promise
of
from
the
tuesday
two
mornings
after
her
husband
death
mary
fairbrother
woke
at
five
clock
she
had
slept
in
the
bed
with
her
twelve
year
old
declan
who
had
in
sobbing
shortly
after
midnight
he
was
sound
asleep
now
so
mary
crept
out
of
the
room
and
went
down
into
the
kitchen
to
cry
more
every
hour
that
passed
added
to
her
grief
because
it
bore
her
further
away
from
the
living
man
and
because
it
was
tiny
of
the
she
would
have
to
spend
without
him
again
and
again
she
found
herself
forgetting
for
the
space
of
that
he
was
gone
for
ever
and
that
she
could
not
turn
to
him
for
comfort
when
her
sister
and
brother
in
law
came
through
to
make
breakfast
mary
took
barry
phone
and
into
the
study
where
she
started
looking
for
the
numbers
of
some
of
barry
huge
she
had
only
been
at
it
matter
of
minutes
when
the
mobile
in
her
hands
rang
yes
she
murmured
oh
hello
looking
for
barry
fairbrother
from
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette
the
young
woman
voice
was
as
loud
and
horrible
in
mary
ear
as
the
of
it
the
sense
of
the
words
sorry
from
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette
want
to
speak
to
barry
fairbrother
it
about
his
article
on
the
fields
oh
said
mary
yes
he
hasn
details
of
this
girl
he
about
we
re
supposed
to
interview
her
krystal
weedon
each
word
felt
to
mary
like
she
sat
still
and
silent
in
barry
old
swivel
chair
and
let
the
rain
upon
her
can
you
hear
me
yes
said
mary
her
voice
can
hear
you
know
mr
fairbrother
was
very
keen
to
be
present
when
we
interview
krystal
but
time
running
he
won
be
able
to
be
present
said
mary
her
voice
into
he
won
be
able
to
talk
about
the
bloody
fields
any
more
or
about
anything
ever
again
what
said
the
girl
on
the
end
of
the
line
my
husband
is
dead
all
right
he
dead
so
the
fields
will
have
to
get
on
without
him
won
they
mary
hands
were
shaking
so
much
that
the
mobile
slipped
through
her
fingers
and
for
the
few
moments
before
she
managed
to
cut
the
call
she
knew
that
the
journalist
heard
her
sobs
then
she
remembered
that
most
of
barry
last
day
on
earth
and
their
wedding
anniversary
had
been
given
over
to
his
obsession
with
the
fields
and
krystal
weedon
fury
erupted
and
she
threw
the
mobile
so
hard
across
the
room
that
it
hit
framed
picture
of
their
four
children
knocking
it
to
the
floor
she
began
to
scream
and
cry
at
once
and
her
sister
and
brother
in
law
both
came
running
upstairs
and
burst
into
the
room
all
they
could
get
out
of
her
at
first
was
the
fields
the
bloody
bloody
fields
it
where
me
and
barry
up
her
brother
in
law
muttered
but
he
explained
no
further
for
fear
of
mary
ii
social
worker
kay
bawden
and
her
daughter
gaia
had
moved
from
london
only
four
weeks
previously
and
were
pagford
very
kay
was
unfamiliar
with
the
history
of
the
fields
it
was
simply
the
estate
where
many
of
her
clients
lived
all
she
knew
about
barry
fairbrother
was
that
his
death
had
the
miserable
scene
in
her
kitchen
when
her
lover
gavin
had
from
her
and
her
scrambled
eggs
and
so
all
the
his
love
making
had
roused
in
her
kay
spent
tuesday
lunchtime
in
between
pagford
and
yarvil
eating
sandwich
in
her
car
and
reading
large
of
notes
one
of
her
colleagues
had
been
signed
off
work
due
to
with
the
immediate
result
that
kay
had
been
with
third
of
her
cases
shortly
before
one
clock
she
set
off
for
the
fields
she
had
already
visited
the
estate
several
times
but
she
was
not
yet
familiar
with
the
warren
like
streets
at
last
she
found
foley
road
and
identified
from
distance
the
house
that
she
thought
must
belong
to
the
weedons
the
file
had
made
it
clear
what
she
was
likely
to
meet
and
her
first
glimpse
of
the
house
met
her
pile
of
refuse
was
heaped
against
the
front
wall
carrier
bags
bulging
with
filth
together
with
old
clothes
and
bits
of
the
rubbish
had
or
been
over
the
patch
of
lawn
but
the
of
it
remained
piled
beneath
one
of
the
two
downstairs
windows
old
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
it
had
been
shifted
some
time
recently
because
foot
away
there
was
brown
circle
of
dead
grass
after
ringing
the
doorbell
kay
noticed
used
in
the
grass
beside
her
feet
like
the
of
some
huge
she
was
that
slight
apprehension
that
she
had
never
quite
although
it
was
nothing
compared
to
the
nerves
with
which
she
had
faced
unknown
doors
in
the
early
days
then
in
spite
of
all
her
training
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
colleague
usually
accompanied
her
she
had
on
occasion
been
truly
afraid
dangerous
men
children
with
grotesque
injuries
she
had
found
them
all
and
worse
in
her
years
of
entering
strangers
houses
nobody
came
in
answer
to
the
bell
but
she
could
hear
small
child
through
the
ground
floor
window
on
her
left
which
was
she
tried
on
the
door
instead
and
tiny
of
cream
fell
off
and
landed
on
the
of
her
it
reminded
her
of
the
state
of
her
own
new
home
it
would
have
been
nice
if
gavin
had
offered
to
help
with
some
of
her
but
he
had
said
not
word
sometimes
kay
counted
over
the
things
that
he
had
not
said
or
done
like
looking
through
and
felt
and
angry
and
determined
to
she
knocked
again
sooner
than
she
would
have
done
if
she
had
not
wanted
to
herself
from
her
own
thoughts
and
this
time
distant
voice
said
fuckin
comin
the
door
swung
open
to
reveal
woman
who
appeared
child
like
and
ancient
dressed
in
dirty
pale
blue
shirt
and
pair
of
men
bottoms
she
was
the
same
height
as
kay
but
shrunken
the
bones
of
her
face
and
showed
sharply
through
the
thin
white
skin
her
hair
which
was
home
and
very
red
looked
like
on
top
of
her
were
and
her
chest
virtually
hello

terri
kay
bawden
from
social
services
covering
for
mattie

all
over
the
woman
fragile
grey
white
arms
and
an
angry
red
open
sore
on
the
inside
of
one
wide
area
of
scar
on
her
right
arm
and
lower
neck
gave
the
skin
shiny
plastic
appearance
kay
had
known
an
in
london
who
had
accidentally
set
fire
to
her
house
and
realized
too
late
what
was
happening
yeah

said
terri
after
an
pause
when
she
spoke
she
seemed
much
older
several
of
her
teeth
were
missing
she
turned
her
back
on
kay
and
took
few
steps
down
the
dark
hallway
kay
followed
the
house
smelt
of
stale
food
of
sweat
of
filth
terri
led
kay
through
the
first
door
on
the
left
into
tiny
sitting
room
there
were
no
books
no
pictures
no
photographs
no
television
nothing
except
pair
of
filthy
old
armchairs
and
broken
set
of
shelves
the
floor
pile
of
brand
new
cardboard
boxes
piled
against
the
wall
struck
an
note
bare
little
boy

standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
dressed
in
shirt
and
bulging
pull
up
kay
knew
from
the
file
that
he
was
three
and
half
his
whining
seemed
unconscious
and
sort
of
engine
noise
to
that
he
was
there
he
was
clutching
packet
so
this
must
be
robbie
said
kay
the
boy
looked
at
her
when
she
said
his
name
but
kept
terri
shoved
aside
scratched
old
biscuit
tin
which
had
been
sitting
on
one
of
the
dirty
armchairs
and
curled
herself
into
the
seat
watching
kay
from
beneath
drooping
kay
took
the
other
chair
on
the
arm
of
which
was
an
cigarette

fallen
into
the
seat
of
kay
chair

could
feel
them
beneath
her
hello
robbie
said
kay
opening
terri
file
the
little
boy

and

little
figure

near

forced
her

into
the
gap
the
boxes

heavy
and
difficult
to
move

to
grasp
the
model

small
toy
cars

down
under
the
broken
shelves

robbie
pointing
at
them
he
did
not
follow
the
direction
of
her
finger

at

with
mixture
of
and
curiosity

he
off
