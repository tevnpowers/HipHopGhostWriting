was
off

and
the
closed

of

yelled
at
the
closed
door
his
whole
face
was
with
the
force
of
his
muttered
gaia
on
the
other
side
she
was
holding

her
shirt
to
sukhvinder

staff
room
fully
dressed
and
all
up
her
arms
it
bit
ah
said
howard
glancing
at
sukhvinder
white
arms
and
then
back
at
gaia
who
looked
every
bit
as
as
he
had
hoped
ll
get
black
one
for
next
week
said
sukhvinder
unable
to
look
howard
in
the
eye
fine
he
said
patting
gaia
in
the
small
of
her
back
as
he
sent
the
pair
of
them
through
to
the
café
he
called
to
his
staff
at
large
we
re
nearly
there
doors
open

maureen
there
was
already
little
knot
of
customers
waiting
on
the
pavement
sign
outside
read
the
copper
kettle
opening
today
first
coffee
free
andrew
did
not
see
gaia
again
for
hours
howard
kept
him
busy
milk
and
fruit
up
and
down
the
steep
steps
and
the
floor
of
the
small
kitchen
area
at
the
back
he
was
given
lunch
break
earlier
than
either
of
the
the
next
glimpse
he
got
of
her
was
when
howard
summoned
him
to
the
counter
of
the
café
and
they
passed
within
inches
of
each
other
as
she
walked
in
the
other
direction
towards
the
back
room
we
re
mr
price
said
howard
in
high
good
humour
get
yourself
clean
apron
and
mop
down
some
of
these
tables
for
me
while
gaia
has
her
lunch
miles
and
samantha
mollison
had
sat
down
with
their
two
daughters
and
shirley
at
table
in
the
window
it
seems
to
be
going
well
doesn
it
shirley
said
looking
around
but
what
on
earth
is
that
jawanda
girl
wearing
under
her
dress
suggested
miles
across
the
room
hi
sukhvinder
called

shirley
her
granddaughter

from
behind
the
counter
in
her
short
black
dress
and
frilly
apron
and
shirley
into
her
coffee
oh
dear
she
said
quietly
as
maureen
walked
towards
them
beaming
it
was
true
samantha
thought
maureen
looked
ridiculous
especially
next
to
pair
of
sixteen
year
in
identical
dresses
but
she
was
not
going
to
give
shirley
the
satisfaction
of
with
her
she
turned
away
watching
the
boy
mopping
tables
he
was
spare
but
reasonably
broad
she
could
see
his
muscles
working
under
the
loose
shirt
to
think
that
miles
big
fat
could
ever
have
been
that
small
and
tight
then
the
boy
turned
into
the
light
and
she
saw
his
acne
not
half
bad
is
it
maureen

out

every
ten
minutes
all
day
greeting
customers
and
checking
the
flow
of
cash
into

he

himself
up

back
of

andrew

need
anything
up
from
the
andrew
was
forced
to
wait
beside
the
counter
while
people
passed
to
and
from
the
bathroom
maureen
was
up
sukhvinder
with
plates
of
sandwiches
how
your
mother
she
asked
the
girl
abruptly
as
though
the
thought
had
just
occurred
to
her
fine
said
sukhvinder
her
colour
rising
not
too
upset
by
that
nasty
business
on
the
council
website
no
said
sukhvinder
her
eyes
andrew
proceeded
out
into
the
yard
which
in
the
early
afternoon
had
become
warm
and
he
had
hoped
that
gaia
might
be
there
taking
breath
of
fresh
air
but
she
must
have
gone
into
the
staff
room
in
the
deli
disappointed
he
lit
up
cigarette
he
had
barely
when
gaia
emerged
from
the
café
her
lunch
with
can
of
drink
hi
said
andrew
his
mouth
dry
hi
she
said
then
after
moment
or
two
why
that
friend
of
yours
such
shit
to
sukhvinder
is
it
personal
or
is
he
he
isn
said
andrew
he
removed
the
cigarette
from
his
mouth
trying
to
keep
his
hands
from
trembling
but
could
not
think
of
anything
else
to
say
the
sunshine
reflected
off
the
his
sweaty
back
close
proximity
to
her
in
the
tight
black
dress
was
almost
especially
now
that
he
had
glimpsed
what
lay
beneath
he
took
another
drag
of
the
cigarette
not
knowing
when
he
had
felt
so
or
so
alive
what
she
ever
done
to
him
though
the
curve
of
her
to
her
tiny
waist
the
of
her
wide
eyes
over
the
can
of
andrew
felt
like
saying
nothing
he
bastard
ll
hit
him
if
you
let
me
touch
you
sukhvinder
emerged
into
the
yard
blinking
in
the
sunlight
she
looked
uncomfortable
and
hot
in
gaia
top
he
wants
you
back
in
she
said
to
gaia
he
can
wait
said
gaia
coolly
this
ve
only
had
forty
minutes
andrew
and
sukhvinder
contemplated
her
as
she
her
drink
by
her
arrogance
and
her
beauty
was
that
old
bitch
saying
something
to
you
just
then
about
your
mum
gaia
asked
sukhvinder
sukhvinder
nodded
think
it
might
ve
been
his
mate
she
said
staring
at
andrew
again
and
he
found
her
on
his
even
if
she
meant
it
to
be
who
put
that
message
about
your
mum
on
that
website
can
ve
been
said
andrew
and
his
voice
slightly
whoever
did
it
went
after
my
old
man
too
couple
of
weeks
ago
what
asked
gaia
the
same
person
something
about
your
dad
he
nodded
relishing
her
interest
something
about
wasn
it
asked
sukhvinder
with
considerable
daring
yeah
said
andrew
and
he
got
the
sack
for
it
yesterday
so
her
mum
he
met
gaia
gaze
almost
steadily
isn
the
only
one
who
suffered
bloody
hell
said
gaia
the
can
and
throwing
it
into
bin
people
round
here
are
mental
iv
the
post
about
parminder
on
the
council
website
had
driven
colin
wall
fears
to
new
level
he
could
only
guess
how
the
mollisons
were
getting
their
information
but
if
they
knew
that
about
parminder
for
god
sake
colin
tessa
had
said
it
just
gossip
there
nothing
in
it
but
colin
did
not
dare
believe
her
he
was
to
that
others
too
lived
with
secrets
that
drove
them
half
he
could
not
even
take
comfort
in
knowing
that
he
had
spent
most
of
his
adult
life
in
dread
of
that
had
not
because
by
the
law
of
one
of
them
was
bound
to
come
true
one
day
he
was
thinking
about
his
imminent
exposure
as
he
thought
about
it
constantly
while
walking
back
from
the
at
half
past
two
and
it
was
not
until
the
from
the
new
café
caught
his
startled
attention
that
he
realized
where
he
was
he
would
have
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
square
if
he
had
not
been
already
level
with
the
copper
kettle
windows
mere
proximity
to
any
mollison
frightened
him
now
then
he
saw
something
through
the
glass
that
made
him
do
double
take
when
he
entered
their
kitchen
ten
minutes
later
tessa
was
on
the
telephone
to
her
sister
colin
the
leg
of
in
the
fridge
and
marched
upstairs
all
the
way
to
fats
open
the
door
he
saw
as
he
had
expected
deserted
room
he
could
not
remember
the
last
time
he
had
been
in
here
the
floor
was
covered
in
dirty
clothes
there
was
an
odd
smell
even
though
fats
had
left
the
propped
open
colin
noticed
large
on
fats
desk
he
slid
it
open
and
saw
mass
of
twisted
cardboard
packet
of
lay
on
the
desk
beside
the
computer
colin
heart
seemed
to
have
down
out
of
his
chest
to
against
his
guts
colin
came
tessa
voice
from
the
landing
below
where

he
roared
she
appeared
at
fats
door
looking
frightened
and
anxious

picked
up
the
and
showed
her
the
contents

tessa
had
been
pretending
to
believe
fats
whenever
he
said
that
he
was
going
out
with
andrew
for
days
she
had
been
telling
herself
that

scared
of

she
did
not

in
the
drawers
or
in
fats
school
bag
she
did
not

or
under
the
bed

her
come
downstairs

jaw
drugs
in
his
bin
the
son
of
the
deputy
headmaster
tessa

fats
computer
chair
felt
familiar
of
anger
she
knew
that
self
was
an
inevitable
of
his
illness
but
sometimes
plenty
of
teenagers
she
said
still
him

you
doesn
it
ever
to
you
that
it
your
constant
excuses
for
him

him
think

of

before

she
was
sure
he
had
arranged
his
expression
in
advance
mixture
of
and
afternoon
he
said

looked
towards
colin
in
the
hope
that

might
follow

lead
and
move
towards
the
door
he
remained
fixed
in
the
middle
of
the
room
staring
at
fats
in
horror

involved
with
krystal
weedon
colin
asked
they

we
don
do
it
in
either
of
our
houses
do
colin
had
raised
one
of
his
stiff
arms
and
swung
it
he
connected
with
fats
cheek
and
fats
whose
attention
had
been
on
his
mother
was
caught
off
guard
he
sideways
hit
the
desk
and
slid
momentarily
to
the
floor
moment
later
he
had
jumped
to
his
feet
again
but
tessa
had
already
placed
herself
between
the
pair
of
them
facing
her
son
behind
her
colin
was
you
little
bastard
you
little
bastard
yeah
said
fats
and
he
was
no
longer
rather
be
little
bastard
than
be
you
you
no
shouted
tessa
colin
get
out
get
out
horrified
furious
and
shaken
colin
lingered
for
moment
then
marched
from
the
room
they
heard
him
little
on
the
stairs
how
could
you
tessa
whispered
to
her
son
how
could
fucking
what
said
stuart
and
the
look
on
his
face
her
so
much
that
she
hurried
to
close
and
bar
the
bedroom
door
you
re
taking
advantage
of
that
girl
stuart
and
you
know
it
and
the
way
you
just
spoke
to
your
the
fuck
am
said
fats
pacing
up
and
down
every
of
cool
gone
the
fuck
taking
advantage
of
her
she
knows
exactly
what
she
wants
just
because
she
lives
in
the
fucking
fields
it
doesn
the
truth
is
you
and
cubby
don
want
me
to
shag
her
because
you
think
she
beneath
that
not
true
said
tessa
even
though
it
was
and
for
all
her
concern
about
krystal
she
would
still
have
been
glad
to
know
that
fats
had
sense
enough
to
wear
you
re
fucking
you
and
cubby
he
said
still
pacing
the
length
of
the
bedroom
all
the
the
pair
of
you
about
wanting
to
help
the
weedons
but
you
don
want
that
enough
shouted
tessa
don
you
dare
speak
to
me
like
that
don
you
realise
don
you
understand
are
you
so
damn
words
failed
her
she
turned
tugged
open
his
door
and
was
gone
slamming
it
behind
her
her
exit
had
an
odd
effect
on
fats
who
stopped
pacing
and
stared
at
the
closed
door
for
several
seconds
then
he
searched
his
pockets
drew
out
cigarette
and
lit
it
not
bothering
to
blow
the
smoke
out
of
the
round
and
round
his
room
he
walked
and
he
had
no
control
of
his
own
thoughts
images
filled
his
brain
sweeping
past
on
tide
of
fury
he
remembered
the
friday
evening
nearly
year
previously
when
tessa
had
come
up
here
to
his
bedroom
to
tell
him
that
his
father
wanted
to
take
him
out
to
play
football
with
barry
and
his
sons
next
day
what
fats
had
been
the
suggestion
was
for
fun
kick
around
tessa
had
said
avoiding
fats
glare
by
scowling
down
at
the
clothes
the
floor
why
because
dad
thought
it
might
be
nice
said
tessa
bending
to
pick
up
school
shirt
declan
wants
practice
or
something
he
got
match
fats
was
quite
good
at
football
people
found
it
surprising
they
expected
him
to
dislike
to
he
played
as
he
talked
with
many
the
daring
to
take
chances
if
they
did
not
come
off
didn
even
know
he
could
play
dad
can
play
very
well
he
was
playing
twice
week
when
we
met
said
tessa
ten
clock
tomorrow
morning
all
right
ll
wash
your
tracksuit
bottoms
fats
sucked
on
his
cigarette
remembering
against
his
will
why
had
he
gone
along
with
it
today
he
would
have
simply
refused
to
in
cubby
little
but
remained
in
bed
until
the
shouting
died
away
year
ago
he
had
not
yet
understood
about
instead
he
had
left
the
house
with
cubby
and
endured
silent
five
minute
walk
each
equally
aware
of
the
enormous
that
filled
all
the
space
between
them
the
playing
field
belonged
to
st
thomas
it
had
been
and
deserted
they
had
divided
into
two
of
three
because
declan
had
friend
staying
for
the
weekend
the
friend
who
clearly
fats
had
joined
fats
and
cubby
team
fats
and
cubby
passed
to
each
other
in
silence
while
barry
easily
the
worst
player
had
yelled
and
in
his
yarvil
accent
as
he
up
and
down
the
they
had
marked
out
with
when
fergus
barry
had
run
at
him
for
chest
it
and
smashed
fergus
on
the
jaw
with
the
top
of
his
head
the
two
of
them
had
fallen
to
the
ground
fergus
in
pain
and
laughing
while
barry
sat
through
his
of
fats
had
found
himself
grinning
then
heard
cubby
awkward
booming
laugh
and
turned
away
scowling
and
then
had
come
that
moment
that
moment
with
the
equal
and
nearly
time
to
go
when
fats
had
successfully
the
ball
from
fergus
and
cubby
had
shouted
come
on
stu
cubby
had
never
said
in
his
life
it
sounded
and
unnatural
he
was
trying
to
be
like
barry
barry
easy
conscious
of
his
sons
trying
to
impress
barry
the
ball
had
like
ball
from
fats
foot
and
there
was
time
before
it
hit
cubby
full
in
his
face
before
his
glasses
cracked
and
single
drop
of
blood
beneath
his
eye
to
realize
his
own
to
know
that
he
had
hoped
to
hit
cubby
and
that
the
ball
had
been
for
they
had
never
played
football
again
the
little
in
father
son
had
been
like
before
it
and
never
wanted
him
at
all
he
was
sure
he
had
heard
it
cubby
must
have
been
talking
about
him
they
had
been
in
his
room
who
else
could
cubby
have
been
talking
about
like
give
shit
thought
fats
it
was
what
he
always
suspected
he
did
not
know
why
this
sensation
of
spreading
cold
had
filled
his
chest
fats
pulled
the
computer
chair
back
into
position
from
the
place
where
it
had
been
knocked
when
cubby
had
hit
him
the
authentic
reaction
would
have
been
to
shove
his
mother
out
of
the
way
and
punch
cubby
in
the
face
crack
his
glasses
again
make
him
fats
was
with
himself
that
he
had
not
done
it
but
there
were
other
ways
he
had
things
for
years
he
knew
much
more
about
his
father
ludicrous
fears
than
they
thought
fats
fingers
were
than
usual
spilt
onto
the
from
the
cigarette
in
his
mouth
as
he
brought
up
the
parish
council
website
weeks
previously
he
had
looked
up
and
found
the
line
of
code
that
andrew
had
refused
to
share
after
the
council
message
board
for
few
minutes
he
himself
in
without
difficulty
as
changed
her
to
and
began
to
type
shirley
mollison
was
convinced
that
her
husband
and
son
were
over
the
danger
to
the
council
of
leaving
the
ghost
online
she
could
not
see
how
the
messages
were
worse
than
gossip
and
that
she
knew
was
not
yet
by
law
nor
did
she
believe
that
the
law
would
be
and
enough
to
punish
her
for
what
somebody
else
had
written
that
would
be
proud
as
she
was
of
miles
law
degree
she
was
sure
that
he
must
have
this
bit
wrong
she
was
checking
the
message
boards
even
more
frequently
than
miles
and
howard
had
but
not
because
she
was
afraid
of
legal
consequences
certain
as
she
was
that
barry
fairbrother
ghost
had
not
yet
finished
his
self
task
of
the
pro
fielders
she
was
to
be
the
first
to
set
eyes
on
his
next
post
several
times
day
she
into
patricia
old
room
and
clicked
on
the
page
sometimes
little
would
run
through
her
while
she
was
or
potatoes
and
she
would
to
the
study
only
to
be
disappointed
again
shirley
felt
special
secret
with
the
ghost
he
had
chosen
her
website
as
the
where
he
would
the
of
howard
and
this
she
felt
her
to
the
pride
of
the
who
has
in
which
rare
species
to
but
there
was
more
to
it
than
that
shirley
the
ghost
anger
his
and
his
she
wondered
who
he
might
be
strong
man
standing
behind
herself
and
howard
on
their
side
cutting
path
for
them
through
the
who
crumpled
as
he
them
with
their
own
ugly
somehow
none
of
the
men
in
pagford
seemed
worthy
to
be
the
ghost
she
would
have
felt
disappointed
to
learn
that
it
was
any
of
the
anti
fielders
she
knew
that
if
it
man
said
maureen
good
point
said
howard
think
it
man
said
shirley
coolly
when
howard
left
for
the
café
on
sunday
morning
shirley
still
in
her
dressing
gown
and
holding
her
cup
of
tea
automatically
to
the
study
and
brought
up
the
website
fantasies
of
deputy
headmaster
by
she
set
down
her
tea
with
trembling
hands
clicked
on
the
post
and
read
it
open
then
she
ran
to
the
seized
the
telephone
and
called
the
café
but
the
number
was
mere
five
minutes
later
parminder
jawanda
who
had
also
habit
of
looking
at
the
council
message
boards
much
more
frequently
than
usual
opened
up
the
site
and
saw
the
post
like
shirley
her
immediate
reaction
was
to
telephone
the
walls
were
without
their
son
who
was
still
asleep
upstairs
when
tessa
picked
up
parminder
cut
across
her
friend
greeting
there
post
about
colin
on
the
council
website
don
let
him
see
it
whatever
you
do
tessa
frightened
eyes
to
her
husband
but
he
was
mere
three
feet
from
the
receiver
and
had
already
heard
every
word
that
parminder
had
spoken
so
loudly
and
clearly
ll
call
you
back
said
tessa
urgently
colin
she
said
to
replace
the
receiver
colin
wait
but
he
had
already
out
of
the
room
up
and
down
his
arms
stiff
by
his
side
and
tessa
had
to
to
catch
him
up
perhaps
it
better
not
to
look
she
urged
him
as
his
big
hand
moved
the
mouse
across
the
desk
or
can
read
it
and
fantasies
of
deputy
headmaster
one
of
the
men
hoping
to
the
community
at
parish
council
level
is
colin
wall
deputy
headmaster
at
winterdown
comprehensive
school
voters
might
be
interested
to
know
that
wall
has
very
unusual
fantasy
life
mr
wall
is
so
frightened
that
might
him
of
inappropriate
sexual
behaviour
that
he
has
often
needed
time
off
work
to
calm
himself
down
again
whether
mr
wall
has
actually
first
year
the
ghost
can
only
guess
the
of
his
fantasies
that
even
if
he
hasn
he
would
like
to
stuart
wrote
that
thought
tessa
at
once
colin
face
was
ghastly
in
the
light
pouring
out
of
the
monitor
it
was
how
she
imagined
he
would
look
if
he
had
had
stroke
colin
suppose
has
told
people
he
whispered
the
he
had
always
feared
was
upon
him
it
was
the
end
of
everything
he
had
always
imagined
taking
sleeping
he
wondered
whether
they
had
enough
in
the
house
tessa
who
had
been
momentarily
thrown
by
the
mention
of
the
headmistress
said
wouldn
anyway
she
doesn
know
she
knows
ve
got
yes
but
she
doesn
know
what
you
what
you
re
afraid
of
she
does
said
colin
told
her
before
the
last
time
needed
sick
leave
why
tessa
burst
out
what
on
earth
did
you
tell
her
for
wanted
to
explain
why
it
was
so
important
had
time
off
said
colin
almost
thought
she
needed
to
know
how
serious
it
was
tessa
fought
down
powerful
desire
to
shout
at
him
the
of
with
which
treated
him
and
talked
about
him
was
explained
tessa
had
never
liked
her
always
thought
her
hard
and
be
that
as
it
may
she
said
don
think
got
anything
to
do
not
directly
said
colin
pressing
trembling
hand
to
his
sweating
upper
lip
but
mollison
heard
gossip
from
somewhere
it
wasn
mollison
stuart
wrote
that
know
he
did
tessa
recognized
her
son
in
every
line
she
was
even
that
colin
could
not
see
it
that
he
had
not
connected
the
message
with
yesterday
row
with
his
son
he
couldn
even
resist
bit
of
he
must
have
done
all
of
them
simon
price
parminder
tessa
was
horror
struck
but
colin
was
not
thinking
about
stuart
he
was
recalling
thoughts
that
were
as
vivid
as
memories
as
violent
ideas
hand
and
as
he
passed
through
packed
young
bodies
cry
of
pain
child
face
and
then
asking
himself
again
and
again
had
he
done
it
had
he
enjoyed
it
he
could
not
remember
he
only
knew
that
he
kept
thinking
about
it
seeing
it
happen
feeling
it
happen
soft
flesh
through
thin
cotton
pain
and
shock
how
many
times
he
did
not
know
he
had
spent
hours
wondering
how
many
of
the
children
knew
he
did
it
whether
they
had
spoken
to
each
other
how
long
it
would
be
until
he
was
exposed
not
knowing
how
many
times
he
had
and
unable
to
trust
himself
he
himself
with
so
many
papers
and
files
that
he
had
no
hands
free
to
attack
as
he
moved
through
the
corridors
he
shouted
at
the
children
to
get
out
of
the
way
to
stand
clear
as
he
passed
none
of
it
helped
there
were
always
running
past
him
up
against
him
and
with
his
hands
he
imagined
other
ways
to
have
contact
with
them
swiftly
elbow
against
breast
side
step
to
ensure
contact
leg
accidentally
so
that
the
child
made
contact
with
his
flesh
colin
said
tessa
but
he
had
started
to
cry
again
great
sobs
shaking
his
big
body
and
when
she
put
her
arms
around
him
and
pressed
her
face
to
his
her
own
tears
wet
his
skin
few
miles
away
in
hilltop
house
simon
price
was
sitting
at
brand
new
family
computer
in
the
sitting
room
watching
andrew
away
to
his
weekend
job
with
howard
mollison
and
the
reflection
that
he
had
been
forced
to
pay
full
market
price
for
this
computer
made
him
feel
and
hard
done
by
simon
had
not
looked
at
the
parish
council
website
once
since
the
night
that
he
had
thrown
out
the
stolen
pc
but
it
occurred
to
him
by
an
of
ideas
to
check
whether
the
message
that
had
cost
him
his
job
was
still
on
the
site
and
by
it
was
not
simon
did
not
know
that
he
owed
this
to
his
wife
because
ruth
was
scared
of
that
she
had
telephoned
shirley
even
to
request
the
of
the
post
slightly
by
its
absence
simon
looked
for
the
post
about
parminder
but
that
was
gone
too
he
was
about
to
close
the
site
when
he
saw
the
post
which
was
fantasies
of
deputy
headmaster
he
read
it
through
twice
and
then
alone
in
the
sitting
room
he
began
to
laugh
it
was
laugh
he
had
never
taken
to
that
big
man
with
his
massive
forehead
it
was
good
to
know
that
he
simon
had
got
off
very
lightly
indeed
by
ruth
came
into
the
room
smiling
she
was
glad
to
hear
simon
laughing
because
he
had
been
in
dreadful
mood
since
losing
his
job
what

simon
in
high
good
humour
ruth
waited
until
he
had
left
the
room
before
trying
to
call
her
friend
shirley
and
alert
her
to
this
new
scandal
but

crucial
in
the
over
the
fields
howard
had
refused
to
the
votes
on
the
future
of
bellchapel
addiction
clinic
or
the
town
wish
to
of
the
estate
to
yarvil
parminder
therefore
suggested
that
she
colin
and
kay
ought
to
meet
up
the
evening
before
the
meeting
to
discuss
pagford
can
decide
to
the
parish
boundary
can
it
asked
kay
no
said
parminder
patiently
kay
could
not
help
being
newcomer
but
the
district
council
has
asked
for
pagford
opinion
and
howard
determined
to
make
sure
it
his
opinion
that
gets
passed
on
they
were
holding
their
meeting
in
the
walls
sitting
room
because
tessa
had
put
pressure
on
colin
to
invite
the
other
two
where
she
could
listen
in
tessa
handed
around
glasses
of
wine
put
large
bowl
of
on
the
coffee
table
then
sat
back
in
silence
while
the
other
three
talked
she
was
exhausted
and
angry
the
anonymous
post
about
colin
had
brought
on
one
of
his
most
of
anxiety
so
that
he
had
been
unable
to
go
to
school
parminder
knew
how
ill
he
was
she
had
signed
him
off
work
yet
she
invited
him
to
in
this
pre
meeting
not
caring
it
seemed
what
fresh
of
and
distress
tessa
would
have
to
deal
with
tonight
there
definitely
resentment
out
there
about
the
way
the
mollisons
are
things
colin
was
saying
in
the
tone
he
sometimes
adopted
when
pretending
to
be
stranger
to
fear
and
think
it
starting
to
get
up
people
the
way
they
think
that
they
can
speak
for
the
town
ve
got
that
impression
you
know
while
ve
been
it
would
have
been
nice
thought
tessa
bitterly
if
colin
could
have
summoned
these
of
for
her
benefit
occasionally
once
long
ago
she
had
liked
being
colin
the
only
of
his
and
the
of
all
reassurance
but
she
no
longer
found
it
he
had
kept
her
awake
from
two
clock
until
half
past
three
that
morning
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
crying
saying
that
he
wished
he
were
dead
that
he
could
not
take
it
that
he
wished
he
had
never
stood
for
the
seat
that
he
was
ruined
tessa
heard
fats
on
the
stairs
and
but
her
son
passed
the
open
door
on
his
way
to
the
kitchen
with
nothing
worse
than
glance
at
colin
who
was
in
front
of
the
fire
on
leather
his
knees
level
with
his
chest
maybe
miles
standing
for
the
empty
seat
will
really
people
even
the
mollisons
natural
said
kay
think
it
might
said
colin
kay
turned
to
parminder
you
think
the
council
will
really
vote
to
force
bellchapel
out
of
their
building
know
people
get
about
needles
and
hanging
around
the
but
the
clinic
miles
away
why
does
pagford
care
howard
and
aubrey
are
scratching
each
other
backs
explained
parminder
whose
face
was
taut
with
dark
brown
patches
under
her
eyes
it
was
she
who
would
have
to
attend
the
council
meeting
the
next
day
and
fight
howard
mollison
and
his
without
barry
by
her
side
they
need
to
make
cuts
in
spending
at
district
level
if
howard
the
clinic
out
of
its
cheap
building
it
ll
be
much
more
expensive
to
run
and
fawley
can
say
the
costs
have
increased
and
justify
cutting
council
then
fawley
will
do
his
best
to
make
sure
that
the
fields
get
to
yarvil
tired
of
parminder
pretended
to
examine
the
new
of
papers
about
bellchapel
that
kay
had
brought
with
her
herself
out
of
the
conversation
why
am
doing
this
she
asked
herself
she
could
have
been
sitting
at
home
with
vikram
who
had
been
watching
on
television
with
jaswant
and
rajpal
as
she
left
the
sound
of
their
laughter
had
on
her
when
had
she
last
laughed
why
was
she
here
drinking
nasty
warm
wine
fighting
for
clinic
that
she
would
never
need
and
development
by
people
she
would
probably
dislike
if
she
met
them
she
was
not
who
could
not
see
difference
between
the
of
and
enemies
she
saw
no
light
of
god
shining
from
howard
mollison
she
more
pleasure
from
the
thought
of
howard
losing
than
from
the
thought
of
fields
children
continuing
to
attend
st
thomas
or
from
fields
people
being
able
to
break
their
at
bellchapel
although
in
distant
and
way
she
thought
that
these
were
good
things
but
she
knew
why
she
was
doing
it
really
she
wanted
to
win
for
barry
he
had
told
her
all
about
coming
to
st
thomas
his
had
invited
him
home
to
play
he
who
had
been
living
in
caravan
with
his
mother
and
two
brothers
had
the
neat
and
comfortable
houses
of
hope
street
and
been
by
the
big
victorian
houses
on
church
row
he
had
even
attended
birthday
party
in
that
very
cow
faced
house
that
he
had
subsequently
bought
and
where
he
had
raised
his
four
children
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
pagford
with
the
river
and
the
fields
and
the
solid
houses
he
had
about
having
garden
to
play
in
tree
from
which
to
hang
swing
space
and
everywhere
he
had
collected
and
taken
them
back
to
the
fields
after
shining
at
st
thomas
top
of
his
class
barry
had
gone
on
to
be
the
first
in
his
family
to
go
to
university
love
and
hate
parminder
thought
little
frightened
by
her
own
honesty
love
and
hate
that
why
here
she
turned
over
page
of
kay
concentration
kay
was
pleased
that
the
doctor
was
her
papers
so
carefully
because
she
had
put
lot
of
time
and
thought
into
them
she
could
not
believe
that
anybody
reading
her
material
would
not
be
convinced
that
the
bellchapel
clinic
ought
to
remain
in
but
through
all
the
the
anonymous
case
and
first
person
kay
really
thought
of
the
clinic
in
terms
of
only
one
patient
terri
weedon
there
had
been
change
in
terri
kay
could
feel
it
and
it
made
her
both
proud
and
frightened
terri
was
showing
faint
of
an
sense
of
control
over
her
life
twice
lately
terri
had
said
to
kay
they
ain
robbie
won
and
these
had
not
been
against
fate
but
of
took
im
ter
nursery
day
she
told
kay
who
had
made
the
mistake
of
looking
why
tha
so
fuckin
aren
good
enough
ter
go
ter
the
fuckin
if
bellchapel
door
was
slammed
shut
against
terri
kay
was
sure
it
would
blow
to
pieces
that
delicate
they
were
trying
to
out
of
the
of
life
terri
seemed
to
have
fear
of
pagford
that
kay
did
not
understand
ate
that
fuckin
place
she
had
said
when
kay
had
mentioned
it
in
passing
beyond
the
fact
that
her
dead
grandmother
had
lived
there
kay
knew
nothing
of
terri
history
with
the
town
but
she
was
afraid
that
if
terri
was
asked
to
travel
there
for
her
methadone
her
self
control
would
and
with
it
the
family
fragile
new
safety
colin
had
taken
over
from
parminder
the
history
of
the
fields
kay
nodded
bored
and
said
but
her
thoughts
were
long
way
away
colin
was
deeply
by
the
way
this
attractive
young
woman
was
hanging
on
his
every
word
he
felt
tonight
than
at
any
point
since
he
had
read
that
awful
post
which
was
gone
from
the
website
none
of
the
that
colin
had
imagined
in
the
small
hours
had
come
to
pass
he
was
not
there
was
no
angry
outside
his
front
door
nobody
on
the
pagford
council
website
or
indeed
anywhere
else
on
the
internet
he
had
performed
several
was
demanding
his
arrest
or
fats
walked
back
past
the
open
door
into
his
mouth
as
he
went
he
glanced
into
the
room
and
for
fleeting
moment
met
colin
gaze
colin
immediately
lost
the
of
what
he
had
been
saying
and
yes
well
that
it
in
he
finished
he
glanced
towards
tessa
for
reassurance
but
his
wife
was
staring
into
space
colin
was
little
hurt
he
would
have
thought
that
tessa
would
be
glad
to
see
him
feeling
so
much
better
so
much
more
in
control
after
their
night
dreadful
of
dread
were
his
stomach
but
he
drew
much
comfort
from
the
proximity
of
his
fellow
and
parminder
and
from
the
sympathetic
attention
of
the
attractive
social
worker
unlike
kay
tessa
had
listened
to
every
word
that
colin
had
just
said
about
the
fields
right
to
remain
joined
to
pagford
there
was
in
her
opinion
no
conviction
behind
his
words
he
wanted
to
believe
what
barry
had
believed
and
he
wanted
to
the
mollisons
because
that
was
what
barry
had
wanted
colin
did
not
like
krystal
weedon
but
barry
had
liked
her
so
he
assumed
that
there
was
more
worth
in
her
than
he
could
see
tessa
knew
her
husband
to
be
strange
mixture
of
arrogance
and
of
conviction
and
they
re
completely
tessa
thought
looking
at
the
other
three
who
were
over
some
that
parminder
had
from
kay
notes
they
think
they
ll
sixty
years
of
anger
and
resentment
with
few
sheets
of
none
of
them
was
barry
he
had
been
living
example
of
what
they
proposed
in
theory
the
through
education
from
to
from
and
to
valuable
to
did
they
not
see
what
hopeless
they
were
compared
to
the
man
who
had
died
people
are
definitely
getting
with
the
mollisons
trying
to
run
everything
colin
was
saying
do
think
said
kay
that
they
ll
be
hard
pushed
if
they
read
this
stuff
to
pretend
that
the
clinic
isn
doing
crucial
work
not
everybody
forgotten
barry
on
the
council
said
parminder
in
slightly
shaky
voice
tessa
realized
that
her
fingers
were
in
space
while
the
others
had
talked
she
had
single
finished
the
entire
bowl
of
vii
it
was
bright
morning
and
the
computing
at
winterdown
comprehensive
became
as
lunchtime
approached
the
dirty
windows
the
dusty
with
of
light
even
though
there
was
no
fats
or
gaia
here
to
him
andrew
price
could
not
concentrate
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
what
he
had
his
parents
discussing
the
previous
evening
they
had
been
talking
quite
seriously
about
moving
to
reading
where
ruth
sister
and
brother
in
law
lived
with
his
ear
turned
towards
the
open
kitchen
door
andrew
had
in
the
tiny
dark
hall
and
listened
simon
it
appeared
had
been
offered
job
or
the
possibility
of
job
by
the
uncle
whom
andrew
and
paul
barely
knew
because
simon
disliked
him
so
much
it
less
money
simon
had
said
you
don
know
that
he
hasn
said
bound
to
be
and
it
ll
be
more
expensive
all
round
living
there
ruth
made
noise
daring
to
breathe
in
the
hall
andrew
could
tell
by
the
mere
fact
that
his
mother
was
not
rushing
to
agree
with
simon
that
she
wanted
to
go
andrew
found
it
impossible
to
imagine
his
parents
in
any
house
but
hilltop
house
or
against
any
but
pagford
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
they
would
remain
there
for
ever
he
andrew
would
leave
one
day
for
london
but
simon
and
ruth
would
remain
to
the
like
trees
until
they
died
he
had
crept
back
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
and
stared
out
of
the
window
at
the
lights
of
pagford
in
the
deep
black
between
the
hills
he
felt
as
though
he
had
never
seen
the
view
before
somewhere
down
there
fats
was
smoking
in
his
room
probably
looking
at
on
his
computer
gaia
was
there
too
absorbed
in
the
mysterious
of
her
it
occurred
to
andrew
that
she
had
been
through
this
she
had
been
away
from
the
place
she
knew
and
they
had
something
in
common
at
last
there
was
almost
pleasure
in
the
idea
that
in
leaving
he
would
share
something
with
her
but
she
had
not
caused
her
own
with
unease
in
his
guts
he
had
picked
up
his
mobile
and
fats
si
pie
offered
job
in
reading
might
take
it
fats
had
still
not
responded
and
andrew
had
not
seen
him
all
morning
because
they
shared
none
of
their
classes
he
had
not
seen
fats
for
the
previous
two
weekends
either
because
he
had
been
working
at
the
copper
kettle
their
conversation
recently
had
concerned
fats
about
cubby
on
the
council
website
think
tessa
suspects
fats
had
told
andrew
casually
she
keeps
looking
at
me
like
she
knows
what
re
you
gonna
say
andrew
had
muttered
scared
he
knew
fats
desire
for
glory
and
credit
and
he
knew
fats
passion
for
the
truth
as
weapon
but
he
was
not
sure
that
his
friend
understood
that
his
own
role
in
the
of
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
must
never
be
revealed
it
had
never
been
easy
to
explain
to
fats
the
reality
of
having
simon
as
father
and
somehow
fats
was
becoming
more
difficult
to
explain
things
to
when
his
it
teacher
had
passed
by
out
of
sight
andrew
looked
up
reading
on
the
internet
it
was
huge
compared
with
pagford
it
had
an
annual
music
it
was
only
forty
miles
from
london
he
contemplated
the
train
service
perhaps
he
would
go
up
to
the
capital
at
weekends
the
way
he
took
the
bus
to
yarvil
but
the
whole
thing
seemed
pagford
was
all
he
had
ever
known
he
still
could
not
imagine
his
family
anywhere
else
at
lunchtime
andrew
headed
straight
out
of
school
looking
for
fats
he
lit
up
cigarette
just
out
of
sight
of
the
grounds
and
was
delighted
to
hear
as
he
was
his
lighter
casually
back
into
his
pocket
female
voice
that
said
gaia
and
sukhvinder
caught
up
with
him
all
right
he
said
blowing
smoke
away
from
gaia
beautiful
face
the
three
of
them
had
something
these
days
that
nobody
else
had
two
weekends
work
at
the
café
had
fragile
between
them
they
knew
howard
stock
phrases
and
had
endured
maureen
interest
in
all
of
their
home
lives
they
had
together
at
her
knees
in
the
too
short
waitress
dress
and
had
exchanged
like
in
foreign
land
small
of
personal
information
the
girls
knew
that
andrew
father
had
been
andrew
and
sukhvinder
knew
that
gaia
was
working
to
save
for
train
back
to
hackney
and
he
and
gaia
knew
that
sukhvinder
mother
hated
her
working
for
howard
mollison
where
your
fat
friend
she
asked
as
the
three
of
them
fell
into
step
together
dunno
said
andrew
haven
seen
him
no
loss
said
gaia
how
many
of
those
do
you
smoke
day
don
said
andrew
by
her
interest
you
want
one
no
said
gaia
don
like
smoking
he
wondered
instantly
whether
the
dislike
to
kissing
people
who
smoked
niamh
fairbrother
had
not
complained
when
he
had
stuck
his
tongue
into
her
mouth
at
the
school
disco
doesn
marco
smoke
asked
sukhvinder
no
he
always
in
training
said
gaia
andrew
had
become
almost
to
the
thought
of
marco
de
luca
by
now
there
were
to
gaia
being
as
it
were
by
an
beyond
pagford
the
power
of
the
photographs
of
them
together
on
her
facebook
page
had
been
by
his
with
them
he
did
not
think
it
was
his
own
thinking
that
the
messages
she
and
marco
left
for
each
other
were
becoming
less
and
less
friendly
he
could
not
know
what
was
happening
by
telephone
or
but
he
was
sure
that
gaia
air
when
he
was
mentioned
was
oh
there
he
is
said
gaia
it
was
not
the
handsome
marco
who
had
come
into
view
but
fats
wall
who
was
talking
to
dane
tully
outside
the
newsagent
sukhvinder
but
gaia
grabbed
her
upper
arm
you
can
walk
where
you
like
she
said
her
gently
onwards
her
green
eyes
as
they
approached
the
place
where
fats
and
dane
were
smoking
all
right
arf
called
fats
as
the
three
of
them
came
close
fats
said
andrew
trying
to
head
off
trouble
especially
fats
sukhvinder
in
front
of
gaia
he
asked
did
you
get
my
text
what
text
said
fats
oh
yeah
that
thing
about
si
you
leaving
then
are
you
it
was
said
with
indifference
that
andrew
could
only
to
the
presence
of
dane
tully
yeah
maybe
said
andrew
where
are
you
going
asked
gaia
my
old
man
been
offered
job
in
reading
said
andrew
oh
that
where
my
dad
lives
said
gaia
in
surprise
we
could
hang
out
when
go
and
stay
the
you
wanna
get
sandwich
then
andrew
was
so
by
her
voluntary
offer
to
spend
time
with
him
that
she
had
disappeared
into
the
newsagent
before
he
could
gather
his
and
agree
for
moment
the
dirty
bus
stop
the
newsagent
even
dane
tully
and
shabby
in
shirt
and
tracksuit
bottoms
seemed
to
glow
with
an
almost
light
well
got
things
to
do
said
fats
dane
before
andrew
could
say
anything
or
offer
to
him
he
had
away
fats
was
sure
that
andrew
would
be
and
hurt
by
his
cool
attitude
and
he
was
glad
of
it
fats
did
not
ask
himself
why
he
was
glad
or
why
general
desire
to
cause
pain
had
become
his
emotion
in
the
last
few
days
he
had
lately
decided
that
questioning
your
own
was
of
his
personal
that
had
made
it
altogether
easier
to
follow
as
he
headed
into
the
fields
fats
thought
about
what
had
happened
at
home
the
previous
evening
when
his
mother
had
entered
his
bedroom
for
the
first
time
since
cubby
had
him
that
message
about
your
father
on
the
parish
council
website
she
had
said
ve
got
to
ask
you
this
stuart
and
wish
stuart
did
you
write
it
it
had
taken
her
few
days
to
the
courage
to
him
and
he
was
prepared
no
he
said
perhaps
it
would
have
been
more
authentic
to
say
yes
but
he
had
preferred
not
to
and
he
did
not
see
why
he
should
have
to
justify
himself
you
didn
she
repeated
with
no
change
of
tone
or
expression
no
he
repeated
because
very
very
few
people
know
what
dad
what
he
about
well
it
wasn
me
the
post
went
up
the
same
evening
that
dad
and
you
had
the
row
and
dad
hit
ve
told
you
didn
do
it
you
know
he
ill
stuart
yeah
so
you
keep
telling
me
keep
telling
you
because
it
true
he
can
help
it
he
got
serious
mental
illness
that
him
distress
and
misery
fats
mobile
had
and
he
had
glanced
down
at
text
from
andrew
he
read
it
and
experienced
an
air
punch
to
the
arf
leaving
for
good
talking
to
you
stuart
know
what
all
these
simon
price
parminder
dad
these
are
all
people
you
know
if
you
re
behind
all
this
ve
told
you
not
you
re
causing
damage
serious
awful
damage
stuart
to
people
lives
fats
was
trying
to
imagine
life
without
andrew
they
had
known
each
other
since
they
were
four
it
not
me
he
had
said
serious
awful
damage
to
people
lives
they
had
made
their
lives
fats
thought
as
he
turned
into
foley
road
the
victims
of
the
ghost
of
barry
fairbrother
were
in
and
lies
and
they
didn
like
the
exposure
they
were
stupid
running
from
bright
light
they
knew
nothing
about
real
life
he
could
see
house
ahead
that
had
lying
on
the
grass
in
front
of
it
he
had
strong
suspicion
that
that
was
krystal
and
when
he
saw
the
number
he
knew
he
was
right
he
had
never
been
here
before
he
would
never
have
agreed
to
meet
her
at
her
home
during
the
lunch
hour
couple
of
weeks
ago
but
things
changed
he
had
changed
they
said
that
her
mother
was
she
was
certainly
krystal
had
told
him
that
the
house
would
be
empty
because
her
mother
would
be
at
bellchapel
addiction
clinic
receiving
her
amount
of
methadone
fats
walked
up
the
garden
path
without
but
with
unexpected
krystal
had
been
on
the
watch
for
him
from
her
bedroom
window
she
had
closed
the
doors
of
every
room
downstairs
so
that
all
he
would
see
was
the
hall
she
had
thrown
everything
that
had
spilt
into
it
back
into
the
sitting
room
and
kitchen
the
carpet
was
and
burnt
in
places
and
the
stained
but
she
could
do
nothing
about
that
there
had
been
none
of
the
pine
left
but
she
had
found
some
and
that
around
the
kitchen
and
bathroom
both
of
them
of
the
worst
in
the
house
when
he
knocked
she
ran
downstairs
they
did
not
have
long
terri
would
probably
be
back
with
robbie
at
one
not
long
to
make
baby
she
said
when
she
opened
the
door
all
right
said
fats
blowing
out
smoke
through
his
nostrils
he
did
not
know
what
he
had
expected
his
first
glimpse
of
the
interior
of
the
house
was
of
bare
box
there
was
no
furniture
the
closed
doors
to
his
left
and
ahead
were
strangely
ominous
are
we
the
only
ones
here
he
asked
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
yeah
said
krystal
we
go
upstairs
my
room
she
led
the
way
the
deeper
inside
they
went
the
worse
the
smell
became
mingled
and
filth
fats
tried
not
to
care
all
doors
were
closed
on
the
landing
except
one
krystal
went
inside
fats
did
not
want
to
be
shocked
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
except
mattress
which
was
covered
with
sheet
and
bare
duvet
and
small
pile
of
clothes
heaped
up
in
corner
few
pictures
ripped
from
newspapers
were
to
the
wall
mixture
of
stars
and
krystal
had
made
her
the
previous
day
in
of
the
one
on
nikki
bedroom
wall
knowing
that
fats
was
coming
over
she
had
wanted
to
make
the
room
more
she
had
drawn
the
thin
curtains
they
gave
to
daylight
she
said
he
lit
it
for
her
she
was
more
nervous
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
he
preferred
her
and
we
ain
got
long
she
told
him
and
with
the
cigarette
in
her
mouth
she
began
to
strip
me
mum
ll
be
back
yeah
at
bellchapel
isn
she
said
fats
somehow
trying
to
krystal
up
again
in
his
mind
yeah
said
krystal
sitting
on
the
mattress
and
pulling
off
her
tracksuit
bottoms
what
if
they
close
it
asked
fats
taking
off
his
heard
they
re
thinking
about
it
dunno
said
krystal
but
she
was
frightened
her
mother
fragile
and
vulnerable
as
could
fail
at
the
slightest
she
had
already
stripped
to
her
fats
was
taking
off
his
shoes
when
he
noticed
something
beside
her
heaped
clothes
small
plastic
jewellery
box
lying
open
and
curled
inside
familiar
watch
is
that
my
mum
he
said
in
surprise
what
krystal
no
she
lied
it
was
my
nana
cath
don
but
he
had
already
pulled
it
out
of
the
box
it
is
hers
he
said
he
recognized
the
it
fuckin
ain
she
was
terrified
she
had
almost
forgotten
that
she
had
stolen
it
where
it
had
come
from
fats
was
silent
and
she
did
not
like
it
the
watch
in
fats
hand
seemed
to
be
both
challenging
and
him
in
quick
he
imagined
walking
out
it
casually
into
his
pocket
or
handing
it
back
to
krystal
with
it
mine
she
said
he
did
not
want
to
be
policeman
he
wanted
to
be
but
it
took
the
recollection
that
the
watch
had
been
cubby
gift
to
make
him
hand
it
back
to
her
and
carry
on
taking
off
his
clothes
scarlet
in
the
face
krystal
tugged
off
bra
and
pants
and
slipped
naked
beneath
the
duvet
fats
approached
her
in
his
wrapped
in
his
hand
we
don
need
that
said
krystal
the
now
are
you
she
moved
over
on
the
mattress
for
him
fats
slid
under
the
duvet
as
he
pulled
off
his
he
wondered
whether
she
was
lying
about
the
like
the
watch
but
he
had
wanted
to
try
without
for
while
go
on
she
whispered
and
she
tugged
the
little
square
out
of
his
hand
and
threw
it
on
top
of
his
crumpled
on
the
floor
he
imagined
krystal
pregnant
with
his
child
the
faces
of
tessa
and
cubby
when
they
heard
his
kid
in
the
fields
his
flesh
and
blood
it
would
be
more
than
cubby
had
ever
managed
he
climbed
on
top
of
her
this
he
knew
was
real
life
viii
at
half
past
six
that
evening
howard
and
shirley
mollison
entered
pagford
church
hall
shirley
was
carrying
an
of
papers
and
howard
was
wearing
the
chain
of
office
decorated
with
the
blue
and
white
pagford
the
beneath
howard
massive
weight
as
he
moved
to
the
head
of
the
scratched
tables
that
had
already
been
set
end
to
end
howard
was
almost
as
fond
of
this
hall
as
he
was
of
his
own
shop
the
used
it
on
and
the
women
on
it
had
jumble
and
wedding
and
and
it
smelt
of
all
of
these
things
of
stale
clothes
and
coffee
and
the
of
home
baked
and
meat
of
dust
and
human
bodies
but
of
aged
wood
and
stone
beaten
lights
hung
from
the
on
thick
black
