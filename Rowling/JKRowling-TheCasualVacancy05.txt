about
the
sense
of
the
words
from
his
mouth
but
only
about
his
own
which
was
song
and
parminder
was
familiar
with
his
she
had
attended
services
for
years
with
all
the
other
st
thomas
parents
long
had
not
her
to
the
white
faced
staring
down
at
her
nor
all
the
dark
wood
the
hard
the
alien
with
its
golden
cross
nor
the
which
she
found
and
so
she
her
attention
from
the
self
conscious
of
the
vicar
and
thought
again
of
her
father
she
had
seen
him
out
of
the
kitchen
window
flat
on
his
face
while
her
continued
to
from
on
top
of
the
he
had
been
lying
there
for
two
hours
while
she
her
mother
and
her
sisters
had
been
in
she
could
still
feel
her
father
shoulder
beneath
his
hot
shirt
as
she
had
shaken
it
they
had
in
the
sad
little
river
in
parminder
could
remember
the
look
of
its
surface
on
an
day
in
and
the
stream
of
tiny
white
and
grey
away
from
her
the
and
into
life
and
she
got
to
her
feet
with
everybody
else
she
caught
glimpse
of
the
backs
of
niamh
and
siobhan
red
gold
heads
they
were
exactly
the
age
she
had
been
when
had
been
taken
from
them
parminder
experienced
rush
of
and
an
awful
ache
and
confused
desire
to
hold
them
and
to
tell
them
that
she
knew
she
knew
she
understood
morning
has
broken
like
the
first
morning
gavin
could
hear
from
along
the
row
barry
younger
son
voice
had
not
yet
broken
he
knew
that
declan
had
chosen
the
that
was
another
of
the
ghastly
details
of
the
service
that
mary
had
chosen
to
share
with
him
he
was
finding
the
funeral
an
even
worse
ordeal
than
he
had
expected
he
thought
it
might
have
been
better
with
wooden
coffin
he
had
had
an
awful
awareness
of
barry
body
inside
that
light
case
the
physical
weight
of
him
was
shocking
all
those
staring
people
as
he
walked
up
the
aisle
did
they
not
understand
what
he
was
actually
carrying
then
had
come
the
ghastly
moment
when
he
had
realized
that
nobody
had
saved
him
place
and
that
he
would
have
to
walk
all
the
way
back
again
while
everybody
stared
and
hide
among
the
at
the
back
but
instead
he
had
been
forced
to
sit
in
the
first
exposed
it
was
like
being
in
the
front
seat
of
bearing
the
of
every
awful
and
sitting
there
mere
feet
from
siobhan
its
head
as
big
as
lid
in
the
middle
of
big
burst
of
yellow
and
he
actually
wished
that
kay
had
come
with
him
he
could
not
believe
it
but
there
it
was
he
would
have
been
by
the
presence
of
somebody
who
was
on
his
side
somebody
simply
to
keep
him
seat
he
had
not
considered
what
sad
bastard
he
might
look
turning
up
alone
the
ended
barry
older
brother
walked
to
the
front
to
speak
gavin
did
not
know
how
he
could
bear
to
do
it
with
barry
corpse
lying
right
in
front
of
him
beneath
the
grown
from
over
months
nor
how
mary
could
sit
so
quietly
with
her
head
apparently
looking
at
the
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
gavin
tried
to
provide
his
own
interior
interference
so
as
to
the
of
the
he
going
to
tell
the
story
about
barry
meeting
mary
once
he
got
past
this
kid
stuff
happy
childhood
high
yeah
yeah
come
on
move
it
along
they
would
have
to
put
barry
back
in
the
car
and
drive
all
the
way
to
yarvil
to
him
in
the
there
because
the
tiny
of
st
michael
and
all
saints
had
been
full
twenty
years
previously
gavin
imagined
lowering
the
coffin
into
the
grave
under
the
eyes
of
this
crowd
carrying
it
in
and
out
of
the
church
would
be
nothing
compared
to
that
one
of
the
twins
was
crying
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
gavin
saw
mary
reach
out
hand
to
hold
her
daughter
let
get
on
with
it
for
fuck
sake
please
think
it
fair
to
say
that
barry
always
knew
his
own
mind
barry
brother
was
saying
he
had
got
few
with
of
barry
in
childhood
the
strain
in
his
voice
was
he
was
twenty
four
when
we
went
off
on
my
weekend
to
first
night
there
we
leave
the
and
go
off
to
the
pub
and
there
behind
the
bar
is
the
landlord
student
daughter
beautiful
blonde
helping
out
on
saturday
night
barry
spent
the
whole
night
up
the
bar
her
up
getting
her
into
trouble
with
her
dad
and
pretending
he
didn
know
who
the
lot
in
the
corner
were
weak
laugh
mary
head
was
drooping
both
hands
were
clutching
those
of
the
child
on
either
side
he
told
me
that
night
back
in
the
that
he
was
going
to
marry
her
thought
hang
on
the
one
who
supposed
to
be
drunk
another
little
made
us
go
back
to
the
same
pub
the
next
night
when
we
got
home
the
first
thing
he
did
was
buy
her
and
send
it
to
her
telling
her
he
be
back
next
weekend
they
were
married
year
to
the
day
after
they
met
and
think
everyone
who
knew
them
would
agree
that
barry
knew
good
thing
when
he
saw
it
they
went
on
to
have
four
beautiful
children
fergus
niamh
siobhan
and
declan
gavin
breathed
carefully
in
and
out
in
and
out
trying
not
to
listen
and
wondering
what
on
earth
his
own
brother
would
find
to
say
about
him
under
the
same
circumstances
he
had
not
had
barry
luck
his
life
did
not
make
pretty
story
he
had
never
walked
into
pub
and
found
the
perfect
wife
standing
there
blonde
smiling
and
ready
to
serve
him
no
he
had
had
who
had
never
seemed
to
think
him
up
to
seven
years
of
had
in
of
the
and
then
with
barely
break
there
had
been
kay
clinging
to
him
like
an
aggressive
and
threatening
but
all
the
same
he
would
ring
her
later
because
he
didn
think
he
would
be
able
to
stand
going
back
to
his
empty
cottage
after
this
he
would
be
honest
and
tell
her
how
horrible
and
the
funeral
had
been
and
that
he
wished
she
had
come
with
him
that
would
surely
any
about
their
row
he
did
not
want
to
be
alone
tonight
two
back
colin
wall
was
sobbing
with
small
but
into
large
wet
tessa
hand
rested
on
his
thigh
gentle
pressure
she
was
thinking
about
barry
about
how
she
had
upon
him
to
help
her
with
colin
of
the
of
shared
laughter
of
barry
of
spirit
she
could
see
him
clearly
short
and
with
parminder
at
their
last
party
howard
mollison
on
the
fields
colin
as
only
he
could
have
done
to
accept
fats
behaviour
as
rather
than
tessa
was
scared
of
what
the
loss
of
barry
fairbrother
would
mean
to
the
man
beside
her
scared
of
how
they
would
manage
to
this
huge
absence
scared
that
colin
had
made
to
the
dead
that
he
could
not
keep
and
that
he
did
not
realize
how
little
mary
to
whom
he
kept
wanting
to
talk
liked
him
and
through
all
tessa
anxiety
and
sorrow
was
the
usual
worry
like
an
little
fats
and
how
she
was
going
to
an
how
she
would
make
him
come
with
them
to
the
or
how
she
might
hide
from
colin
that
he
had
not
come
which
might
after
all
be
easier
we
are
going
to
finish
today
service
with
song
chosen
by
barry
daughters
niamh
and
siobhan
which
meant
lot
to
them
and
their
father
said
the
vicar
he
managed
by
his
tone
to
himself
personally
from
what
was
about
to
happen
the
beat
of
the
rang
so
loudly
through
hidden
that
the
jumped
loud
voice
was
saying
and
good
girl
gone
bad
take
three
action
no
in
my
let
it
rain
into
comin
down
with
the
some
people
thought
that
it
was
mistake
howard
and
shirley
threw
outraged
at
each
other
but
nobody
pressed
stop
or
ran
up
the
aisle
then
powerful
female
voice
started
to
you
had
my
heart
and
we
ll
never
be
apart
maybe
in
magazines
but
you
ll
still
be
my
star
the
were
carrying
the
coffin
back
down
the
aisle
and
mary
and
the
children
were
following
now
that
it
more
than
ever
know
that
we
ll
still
have
each
other
you
can
stand
under
my
you
can
stand
under
my
the
slowly
out
of
the
church
trying
not
to
walk
in
time
to
the
beat
of
the
song
ii
andrew
price
took
the
of
his
father
racing
and
walked
it
carefully
out
of
the
garage
making
sure
that
he
did
not
the
car
down
the
stone
steps
and
through
the
metal
gate
he
carried
it
then
in
the
lane
he
put
his
foot
on
one
few
yards
and
swung
his
other
leg
over
the
he
soared
left
onto
the
road
and
sped
without
touching
his
down
towards
pagford
the
and
sky
he
imagined
himself
in
as
the
wind
his
clean
hair
and
his
face
which
he
had
just
clean
level
with
the
fairbrothers
shaped
garden
he
applied
the
because
some
months
previously
he
had
taken
this
sharp
turn
too
fast
and
fallen
off
and
had
had
to
return
home
immediately
with
his
jeans
ripped
open
and
all
down
one
side
of
his
face
he
with
only
one
hand
on
the
bars
into
church
row
and
enjoyed
second
though
burst
of
speed
slightly
checked
when
he
saw
that
they
were
coffin
onto
outside
the
church
and
that
dark
crowd
was
out
between
the
heavy
wooden
doors
andrew
furiously
around
the
corner
and
out
of
sight
he
did
not
want
to
see
fats
emerging
from
church
with
cubby
wearing
the
cheap
suit
and
tie
that
he
had
described
with
disgust
during
yesterday
english
lesson
it
would
have
been
like
his
friend
having
as
andrew
slowly
around
the
square
he
his
hair
back
off
his
face
with
one
hand
wondering
what
the
cold
air
had
done
to
his
purple
red
acne
and
whether
the
anti
face
wash
had
done
anything
to
the
angry
look
of
it
and
he
told
himself
the
cover
story
he
had
come
from
fats
house
which
he
might
have
done
there
was
no
reason
why
not
which
meant
that
hope
street
was
as
obvious
route
down
to
the
river
as
cutting
through
the
first
side
street
therefore
there
was
no
need
for
gaia
bawden
if
she
happened
to
be
looking
out
of
the
window
of
her
house
and
happened
to
see
him
and
happened
to
recognize
him
to
think
that
he
had
come
this
way
because
of
her
andrew
did
not
having
to
explain
to
her
his
reason
for
cycling
up
her
street
but
he
still
held
the
story
in
his
mind
because
he
believed
it
gave
him
an
air
of
cool
he
simply
wanted
to
know
which
was
her
house
twice
already
at
weekends
he
had
along
the
short
street
every
in
his
body
but
he
had
been
unable
as
yet
to
discover
which
house
the
all
he
knew
from
his
through
the
dirty
school
bus
windows
was
that
she
lived
on
the
right
hand
even
side
as
he
turned
the
corner
he
tried
to
his
features
acting
the
part
of
man
cycling
slowly
towards
the
river
by
the
most
direct
route
lost
in
his
own
serious
thoughts
but
ready
to
acknowledge
should
they
show
themselves
she
was
there
on
the
pavement
andrew
legs
continued
to
though
he
could
not
feel
the
and
he
was
suddenly
aware
how
thin
the
were
on
which
he
balanced
she
was
rummaging
in
her
leather
handbag
her
copper
brown
hair
hanging
around
her
face
number
ten
on
the
door
behind
her
and
black
shirt
falling
short
of
her
waist
band
of
bare
skin
and
heavy
belt
and
tight
jeans
when
he
was
almost
past
her
she
closed
the
door
and
turned
her
hair
fell
back
from
her
beautiful
face
and
she
said
quite
clearly
in
her
london
voice
oh
hi
hi
he
said
his
legs
kept
six
feet
away
twelve
feet
away
why
hadn
he
stopped
shock
kept
him
moving
he
dared
not
look
back
he
was
at
the
end
of
her
street
already
for
fuck
sake
don
fall
off
he
turned
the
corner
too
stunned
to
whether
he
was
more
relieved
or
disappointed
that
he
had
left
her
behind
holy
shit
he
on
towards
the
area
at
the
of
hill
where
the
river
through
the
trees
but
he
could
see
nothing
except
gaia
onto
his
like
the
narrow
road
turned
into
an
and
the
gentle
breeze
off
the
water
his
face
which
he
did
not
think
had
turned
red
because
it
had
all
happened
so
quickly
fucking
hell
he
said
aloud
to
the
fresh
air
and
the
deserted
path
he
through
this
unexpected
her
perfect
body
revealed
in
tight
and
cotton
number
ten
behind
her
on
shabby
blue
door
oh
hi
easily
and
naturally
so
his
features
were
definitely
somewhere
in
the
mind
that
lived
behind
the
face
the
bike
on
the
newly
and
rough
ground
andrew
only
when
he
began
to
he
wheeled
the
on
through
the
trees
emerging
onto
the
narrow
where
he
the
down
on
the
ground
among
the
wood
that
had
opened
like
tiny
white
stars
since
his
last
visit
his
father
had
said
when
he
first
started
to
the
bike
you
chain
it
up
if
you
re
going
in
shop
warning
you
if
that
gets
but
the
chain
was
not
long
enough
to
go
around
any
of
the
trees
and
in
any
case
the
further
he
from
his
father
the
less
andrew
feared
him
still
thinking
about
the
inches
of
flat
bare
and
gaia
face
andrew
strode
to
the
place
where
the
bank
met
the
side
of
the
hill
which
hung
like
an
in
face
above
the
fast
flowing
green
water
the
lip
of
slippery
bank
ran
along
the
bottom
of
the
the
only
way
of
it
if
your
feet
had
grown
to
be
twice
the
length
they
had
been
when
they
had
first
made
the
trip
was
to
edge
along
sideways
pressed
to
the
face
holding
tight
to
and
bits
of
the
green
smell
of
the
river
and
of
wet
was
deeply
familiar
to
andrew
as
was
the
sensation
of
this
narrow
of
earth
and
grass
under
his
feet
and
the
and
he
sought
with
his
hands
on
the
he
and
fats
had
found
the
secret
place
when
they
were
eleven
years
old
they
had
known
that
what
they
were
doing
was
and
dangerous
they
had
been
about
the
river
terrified
but
determined
not
to
tell
each
other
so
they
had
along
this
at
anything
that
from
the
wall
and
at
the
very
point
clutching
of
each
other
shirts
years
of
practice
andrew
though
his
mind
was
barely
on
the
job
to
move
wise
along
the
solid
wall
of
earth
and
with
the
water
three
feet
beneath
his
trainers
then
with
and
swing
he
was
inside
the
in
the
that
they
had
found
so
long
ago
back
then
it
had
seemed
like
reward
for
their
daring
he
could
no
longer
stand
up
in
it
but
slightly
larger
than
two
man
it
was
big
enough
for
two
teenage
boys
to
lie
side
by
side
with
the
river
rushing
past
and
the
trees
their
view
of
the
sky
framed
by
the
entrance
the
first
time
they
had
been
here
they
had
and
at
the
back
wall
with
but
they
had
not
found
secret
leading
to
the
abbey
above
so
they
instead
in
the
fact
that
they
alone
had
discovered
the
hiding
place
and
that
it
would
be
their
secret
in
andrew
had
vague
memory
of
and
they
had
called
it
the
when
they
had
first
discovered
it
but
it
was
now
and
had
been
for
some
time
past
the
cubby
hole
the
little
smelt
though
the
ceiling
was
made
of
dark
green
showed
that
it
had
in
the
past
not
quite
to
the
roof
the
floor
was
covered
in
their
cigarette
and
cardboard
andrew
sat
down
with
his
legs
dangling
over
the
green
water
and
pulled
his
cigarettes
and
lighter
out
of
his
jacket
bought
with
the
last
of
his
birthday
money
now
that
his
had
been
stopped
he
lit
up
deeply
and
the
glorious
encounter
with
gaia
bawden
in
as
much
detail
as
he
could
ring
out
of
it
narrow
waist
and
skin
between
leather
and
shirt
full
wide
mouth
oh
hi
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
her
out
of
school
uniform
where
was
she
going
alone
with
her
leather
handbag
what
was
there
in
pagford
for
her
to
do
on
saturday
morning
was
she
perhaps
the
bus
into
yarvil
what
did
she
get
up
to
when
she
was
out
of
his
sight
what
feminine
absorbed
her
and
he
asked
himself
for
the
time
whether
it
was
that
flesh
and
bone
wrought
like
that
could
contain
personality
it
was
only
gaia
who
had
ever
made
him
wonder
this
the
idea
of
body
and
soul
as
separate
had
never
once
occurred
to
him
until
he
had
clapped
eyes
on
her
even
while
trying
to
imagine
what
her
breasts
would
look
and
feel
like
judged
by
the
evidence
he
had
managed
to
gather
through
slightly
school
shirt
and
what
he
knew
was
white
bra
he
could
not
believe
that
the
she
held
for
him
was
physical
she
had
way
of
moving
that
moved
him
as
much
as
music
which
was
what
moved
him
most
of
all
surely
the
spirit
that
body
must
be
unusual
too
why
would
nature
make
like
that
if
not
to
contain
something
still
more
valuable
andrew
knew
what
naked
women
looked
like
because
there
were
no
on
the
computer
in
fats
bedroom
together
they
had
as
much
online
as
they
could
access
for
free
pink
pulled
wide
to
show
spread
revealing
the
puckered
of
mouths
andrew
excitement
was
always
by
the
awareness
that
you
could
only
hear
mrs
wall
approaching
the
room
when
she
reached
the
halfway
sometimes
they
found
that
made
them
roar
with
laughter
even
when
andrew
was
unsure
whether
he
was
more
excited
or
and
and
once
at
which
even
fats
had
not
managed
to
laugh
close
ups
of
metal
bolted
and
needles
from
soft
flesh
and
women
faces
screaming
together
he
and
fats
had
become
of
breasts
enormous
taut
and
round
plastic
one
of
them
would
point
out
matter
of
as
they
sat
in
front
of
the
monitor
with
the
door
shut
against
fats
parents
the
on
screen
blonde
arms
were
raised
as
she
sat
some
man
her
big
brown
breasts
hanging
off
her
narrow
like
thin
shiny
purple
lines
under
each
of
them
showing
where
the
had
been
you
could
almost
tell
how
they
would
feel
looking
at
them
firm
as
if
there
were
football
underneath
the
skin
andrew
could
imagine
nothing
more
than
natural
breast
soft
and
and
perhaps
little
and
the
he
hoped
hard
and
all
of
these
images
in
his
mind
late
at
night
with
the
offered
by
real
girls
human
girls
and
the
little
you
managed
to
feel
through
clothes
if
you
managed
to
move
in
close
enough
niamh
was
the
less
pretty
of
the
fairbrother
twins
but
she
had
been
the
more
willing
in
the
drama
hall
during
the
christmas
disco
half
hidden
by
the
stage
in
dark
corner
they
had
pressed
against
each
other
and
andrew
had
put
his
tongue
into
her
mouth
his
hands
had
as
far
as
her
bra
and
no
further
because
she
kept
pulling
away
he
had
been
driven
by
the
knowledge
that
somewhere
outside
in
the
darkness
fats
was
going
further
and
now
his
brain
and
throbbed
with
gaia
she
was
both
the
girl
he
had
ever
seen
and
the
source
of
another
entirely
yearning
certain
changes
certain
made
the
very
core
of
him
and
so
did
something
about
gaia
bawden
he
lit
new
cigarette
from
the
end
of
the
first
and
threw
the
into
the
water
below
then
he
heard
familiar
and
leaned
forward
to
see
fats
still
wearing
his
funeral
suit
spread
on
the
hill
wall
moving
from
hand
hold
to
hand
hold
as
he
edged
along
the
narrow
lip
of
bank
towards
the
opening
where
andrew
sat
fats
arf
andrew
pulled
in
his
legs
to
give
fats
room
to
climb
into
the
cubby
hole
fucking
hell
said
fats
when
he
had
inside
he
was
like
in
his
with
his
long
his
by
the
black
suit
andrew
handed
him
cigarette
fats
always
lit
up
as
though
he
were
in
high
wind
one
hand
around
the
flame
to
it
scowling
slightly
he
blew
smoke
ring
out
of
the
cubby
hole
and
the
dark
grey
tie
around
his
neck
he
appeared
older
and
not
after
all
so
very
in
the
suit
which
bore
of
earth
on
the
knees
and
from
the
journey
to
the
you
think
they
were
fats
said
after
he
had
taken
another
powerful
drag
on
his
cigarette
cubby
upset
was
he
upset
he
having
fucking
he
given
himself
he
worse
than
the
fucking
widow
andrew
laughed
fats
blew
another
smoke
ring
and
pulled
at
one
of
his
ears
out
early
they
haven
even
buried
him
yet
they
smoked
in
silence
for
minute
both
looking
out
at
the
river
as
he
smoked
andrew
contemplated
the
words
out
early
and
the
amount
of
fats
seemed
to
have
compared
to
himself
simon
and
his
fury
stood
between
andrew
and
too
much
freedom
in
hilltop
house
you
sometimes
for
simply
because
you
were
present
andrew
imagination
had
once
been
caught
by
strange
little
in
their
and
religion
class
in
which
had
been
discussed
in
all
their
and
violence
and
the
attempts
of
early
to
them
he
had
thought
then
of
the
nature
of
justice
as
he
had
come
to
know
it
of
his
father
as
god
and
of
his
mother
as
the
high
of
the
who
attempted
to
and
usually
yet
still
in
the
face
of
all
the
evidence
that
there
was
an
and
to
her
fats
rested
his
head
against
the
stone
side
of
the
cubby
hole
and
blew
smoke
rings
at
the
ceiling
he
was
thinking
about
what
he
wanted
to
tell
andrew
he
had
been
mentally
the
way
he
would
start
all
through
the
funeral
service
while
his
father
and
sobbed
into
his
fats
was
so
excited
by
the
prospect
of
telling
that
he
was
having
difficulty
containing
himself
but
he
was
determined
not
to
it
out
the
telling
of
it
was
to
fats
of
almost
equal
importance
to
the
doing
of
it
he
did
not
want
andrew
to
think
that
he
had
hurried
here
to
say
it
you
know
how
fairbrother
was
on
the
parish
council
said
andrew
yeah
said
fats
glad
that
andrew
had
space
conversation
si
pie
saying
he
going
to
stand
for
his
seat
si

fats
at
andrew
what
the
fuck
got
into
him

andrew

the
local
community
at
their

andrew
wondering

wrong
man
and
the
wrong

andrew
watching
fats

the
back
and
the
onto
the
he
rolled
the
joint
together
the
end
of
the
papers
to
seal
it

in
more
neatly

point
nice
he
said
happily
he
had
planned
to
tell
andrew
his
news
after
the
as
kind
of
warm
up
act
he
held
out
his
hand
for
andrew
lighter
the
end
between
his
own
lips
and
lit
up
taking
deep
drag
blowing
out
the
smoke
in
long
blue
then
the
process
he
said
holding
the
smoke
in
his

christmas
strong
of

he
experienced
massive
even
though
he
was
sitting
and
laughing
try
that
andrew
leaned
across
and
took
the
joint
giggling
in
anticipation
and
at
the
smile
on
fats
face
which
was
quite
at
odds
with
his
usual
andrew
and
felt
the
power
of
the
drug
out
from
his
lungs
and
him
another
drag
and
he
thought
that
it
was
like
having
your
mind
shaken
out
like
duvet
so
that
it
without
so
that
everything
became
smooth
and
simple
and
easy
and
good
nice
he
echoed
fats
smiling
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
he
passed
the
joint
back
into
fat
waiting
fingers
and
this
sense
of
well
being
so
you
wanna
hear
something
interesting
said
fats

uncontrollably

out
on
his
back
in
his
funeral
suit
his
feet
towards
the
river
andrew
stretched
out
beside
him
in
the
opposite
direction
they
had
slept
like
this
top
and
when
they
had
stayed
overnight
at
each
other
houses
as
children
andrew
gazed
up
at
the
ceiling
where
the
blue
smoke
hung
slowly
and
waited
to
hear
everything
told
cubby
and
tess
was
at
yours
so
you
know
said
fats
he
passed
the
joint
into
andrew

to
himself

andrew
handed
back
the
joint
getting
in

thought

fats
and
andrew
was
half
inclined
to
laugh
afraid
of
missing
every
detail
fats
could
give
him
she

when
was
her
rose
like
trapped

in

in
of
images

on
the
joint
andrew

with
his
on
the
patch
of

good
howard
letters
into
miles
completed
forms
he
set
aside
on
their
own
the
remaining
were
from
fellow
parish
councillors
there
were
no
here
as
soon
as
parminder
had
emailed
him
to
tell
him
that
she
knew
of
somebody
who
was
interested
in
standing
for
barry
seat
he
had
expected
these
six
to
round
her
demanding
an
election
together
with
bends
your
ear
herself
they
were
the
ones
he
the
whose
had
recently
fallen
onto
this
pile
he
placed
the
completed
forms
of
colin
wall
their
chosen
into
third
pile
he
placed
four
more
letters
which
were
from
expected
professional
of
pagford
known
to
howard
as
perennially
and
suspicious
all
to
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette
each
had
their
own
interest
in
some
local
issue
and
considered
themselves
independent
they
would
be
the
ones
most
likely
to
scream
if
miles
had
been
co
but
they
were
among
the
most
anti
fields
people
in
town
howard
took
the
last
two
letters
in
each
hand
them
up
one
of
them
was
from
woman
whom
he
had
never
met
who
claimed
howard
took
nothing
for
granted
to
work
at
the
bellchapel
addiction
clinic
the
fact
that
she
herself
inclined
him
to
believe
her
after
some
he
placed
this
on
top
of
cubby
wall
forms
the
last
letter
and
typed
on
word
demanded
an
election
in
terms
it
had
an
air
of
and
and
was
with
the
letter
the
of
barry
fairbrother
and
named
miles
specifically
as
to
fill
his
howard
wondered
whether
miles
had
client
out
there
who
might
prove
to
be
an
embarrassment
it
was
good
to
be
of
such
however
howard
doubted
whether
the
letter
being
anonymous
counted
as
vote
for
an
election
he
therefore
fed
it
into
the
little
that
shirley
had
given
him
for
christmas
ii
co
the

occupied
the
upper
floor
of

miles
slipped
on
his
overcoat
down
the
steep
stairs
and
walked
briskly
up
the
rain
swept
little
street
that
led
to
the
square
momentary
break
in
the
caused
sunlight
to
the

and
the

experienced
rush
of
pride
as
he
hurried
across
the
square
towards
mollison
and
lowe
that
pagford
institution
that
of
pride
that
had
never

the

pushed
it
open

and
local
he
his
way
carefully
between
the
little
tables
piled
high
with
and
paused
at
the
big
between
delicatessen
and
the
old
shop
which
was
of
its
plastic
for
the
first
time
maureen
miles
recognized

in
the
middle
of
the

peered
through
into
the
clean
spare
space
that
would
soon
be

it
was
and
painted
with
freshly
black

around
the
corner
of
the
counter
and
edged
past
maureen
who
was
operating

the
opportunity
for
and
laugh
then
through
the
door
that
led
into
the
little
back
room
here
was

on
which
maureen
daily
lay
folded
howard
and
maureen
coats
hanging
on
and
door
leading
to
the
lavatory
which
of
miles
hung
up
his
overcoat
and
drew
up
an
old
chair
to
the
table
howard
appeared
minute
or
two
later
bearing
two
heaped
plates
of
delicatessen
fare
definitely
decided
on
the
copper
kettle
then
asked
miles
well
mo
likes
it
said
howard
setting
down
plate
in
front
of
his
son
he
out
returned
with
two
bottles
of
and
closed
the
door
with
his
foot
so
that
the
room
was
in
relieved
only
by
the
dim
light
howard
sat
down
with
deep
he
had
been
on
the
telephone
morning
and
kept
miles
waiting
few
moments
longer
while
he
off
the
lid
of
one
bottle
wall
sent
his
forms
in
he
said
at
last
handing
over
the
beer
ah
said
miles
going
to
set
two
weeks
from
today
for
everyone
to
fair
enough
said
miles
mum
this
price
bloke
is
still
interested
have
you
asked
sam
if
she
knows
who
he
is
yet
no
said
miles
howard
scratched
an
of
the
belly
that
rested
close
to
his
knees
as
he
sat
on
the
chair
everything
all
right
with
you
and
sam
miles
admired
as
always
his
father
almost
not
great
he
would
not
have
confessed
it
to
his
mother
because
he
tried
not
to
the
constant
cold
war
between
shirley
and
samantha
in
which
he
was
both
and
prize
she
doesn
like
the
idea
of
me
standing
miles
howard
raised
his
fair
eyebrows
his
as
he
don
bloody
know
what
got
into
her
she
on
one
of
her
anti
pagford
howard
took
his
time
he
dabbed
at
his
mouth
with
paper
and
she
ll
come
round
quickly
enough
once
you
re
in
he
said
the
social
side
of
it
plenty
for
the
functions
at
sweetlove
house
she
ll
be
in
her
he
took
another
of
and
scratched
his
belly
again
can
picture
this
price
said
miles
returning
to
the
point
but
ve
got
feeling
he
had
kid
in
lexie
class
at
st
thomas
fields
born
though
that
the
thing
said
howard
fields
born
which
could
work
to
our
advantage
split
the
pro
fields
vote
between
him
and
wall
yeah
said
miles
makes
sense
haven
heard
of
anyone
else
it
possible
once
details
hit
the
website
someone
else
ll
come
forward
but
confident
about
our
chances
confident
aubrey
called
howard
added
there
was
always
touch
of
additional
in
howard
tone
when
he
used
aubrey
fawley
name
right
behind
you
goes
without
saying
he
back
this
evening
he
been
in
town
usually
when
said
in
town
they
meant
in
yarvil
howard
and
shirley
used
the
in
of
aubrey
fawley
to
mean
in
london
he
mentioned
something
about
us
all
getting
together
for
chat
maybe
tomorrow
might
even
invite
us
over
to
the
house
sam
like
that
miles
had
just
taken
large
of
bread
and
but
he
conveyed
his
agreement
with
an
nod
he
liked
the
idea
that
aubrey
fawley
was
right
behind
him
samantha
might
at
his
parents
to
the
fawleys
but
miles
noticed
that
on
those
rare
occasions
when
samantha
came
face
to
face
with
either
aubrey
or
julia
her
accent
changed
subtly
and
her
demeanour
became
more
something
else
said
howard
scratching
his
belly
again
got
an
from
the
yarvil
and
district
gazette
this
morning
asking
for
my
views
on
the
fields
as
chair
of
the
parish
council
you
re
thought
fairbrother
had
that
one
up
didn
it
said
howard
with
immense
satisfaction
they
re
going
to
run
his
article
and
they
want
someone
to
argue
against
the
following
week
give
them
the
other
side
of
the
story
hand
lawyer
turn
of
and
all
that
no
problem
said
miles
we
could
talk
about
that
bloody
addiction
clinic
that
make
the
point
yes
very
good
idea
excellent
in
his
enthusiasm
he
had
swallowed
too
much
at
once
and
miles
had
to
him
on
the
back
until
his
had
subsided
at
last
his
eyes
with
howard
said
breathlessly
aubrey
the
district
cuts
from
their
end
and
going
to
put
it
to
our
lot
that
it
time
to
the
lease
on
the
building
it
wouldn
hurt
to
make
the
case
in
the
press
how
much
time
and
money
gone
into
that
bloody
place
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
ve
got
the
figures
howard
bloody
me
iii
gavin
cooked
for
kay
at
his
house
that
evening
opening
and
with
sense
of
ill
after
row
you
had
to
say
certain
things
to
secure
those
were
the
rules
everyone
knew
that
gavin
had
telephoned
kay
from
his
car
on
the
way
back
from
barry
and
told
her
that
he
wished
she
had
been
there
that
the
whole
day
had
been
horrible
and
that
he
hoped
he
could
see
her
that
night
he
considered
these
no
more
or
less
than
the
price
he
had
to
pay
for
an
evening
of
but
kay
seemed
to
consider
them
more
in
the
light
of
down
on
you
missed
me
you
needed
me
when
you
were
upset
you
re
sorry
we
didn
go
as
couple
well
let
not
make
that
mistake
again
there
had
been
certain
about
the
way
she
had
treated
him
since
sense
of
expectation
he
was
making
tonight
he
had
deliberately
to
buy
pudding
or
to
lay
the
table
in
advance
he
was
at
to
show
her
that
he
had
not
made
much
of
an
effort
kay
seemed
oblivious
even
determined
to
take
this
casual
attitude
as
compliment
she
sat
at
his
small
kitchen
table
talking
to
him
over
the
of
rain
on
the
her
eyes
wandering
over
the
and
she
had
not
often
been
here
suppose
chose
this
yellow
did
she
she
was
doing
it
again
breaking
as
though
they
had
recently
passed
to
deeper
level
of
intimacy
gavin
preferred
not
to
talk
about
if
he
could
avoid
it
surely
she
knew
that
by
now
he
shook
onto
the
in
his
and
said
no
this
was
all
the
previous
owner
haven
got
round
to
changing
it
yet
oh
she
said
wine
well
it
quite
nice
bit
this
with
gavin
as
in
his
opinion
the
interior
of
the
was
in
every
way
to
that
of
ten
hope
street
he
watched
the
keeping
his
back
to
her
guess
what
she
said
met
samantha
mollison
this
afternoon
gavin
wheeled
around
how
did
kay
even
know
what
samantha
mollison
looked
like
just
outside
the
deli
in
the
square
was
on
my
way
in
to
get
this
said
kay
the
wine
bottle
beside
her
with
of
her
she
asked
me
whether
was
gavin
kay
said
it
but
actually
she
had
been
by
samantha
choice
of
words
relieved
to
think
that
this
was
how
gavin
described
her
to
his
friends
and
what
did
you
say
said
said
yes
her
expression
was
gavin
had
not
meant
to
ask
the
question
quite
so
aggressively
he
would
have
given
lot
to
prevent
kay
and
samantha
ever
meeting
anyway
kay
proceeded
with
slight
edge
to
her
voice
she
asked
us
for
dinner
next
friday
week
today
oh
bloody
hell
said
gavin
lot
of
kay
deserted
her
what
the
problem
nothing
it
nothing
he
said
the
it
just
that
see
enough
of
miles
during
work
hours
to
be
honest
it
was
what
he
had
dreaded
all
along
that
she
would
her
way
in
and
they
would
become
gavin
and
kay
with
shared
social
circle
so
that
it
would
become
more
difficult
to
her
from
his
life
how
had
he
let
this
happen
why
had
he
allowed
her
to
move
down
here
fury
at
himself
easily
into
anger
with
her
why
couldn
she
realize
how
little
he
wanted
her
and
take
herself
off
without
forcing
him
to
do
the
dirty
he
drained
the
in
the
sink
swearing
under
his
breath
as
he
himself
with
boiling
water
you
better
call
miles
and
samantha
and
tell
them
no
then
said
kay
her
voice
had
as
was
gavin
deeply
habit
he
sought
to
an
imminent
and
hoped
that
the
future
would
look
after
itself
no
no
he
said
at
his
wet
shirt
with
tea
we
ll
go
it
fine
we
ll
go
but
in
his
lack
of
enthusiasm
he
sought
to
put
down
to
which
he
could
you
knew
didn
want
to
go
no
didn
enjoy
it
no
don
want
it
to
happen
again
they
ate
for
several
minutes
in
silence
gavin
was
afraid
that
there
would
be
another
row
and
that
kay
would
force
him
to
discuss
issues
again
he
cast
around
for
something
to
say
and
so
started
telling
her
about
mary
fairbrother
and
the
life
insurance
company
they
re
being
real
he
said
he
was
heavily
but
their
are
looking
for
way
not
to
pay
out
they
re
trying
to
make
out
he
didn
make
full
disclosure
in
what
way
well
an
uncle
died
of
an
too
mary
barry
told
the
insurance
agent
that
when
he
signed
the
but
it
nowhere
in
the
notes
presumably
the
bloke
didn
realize
it
can
be
thing
don
know
that
barry
did
come
to
gavin
voice
broke
horrified
and
embarrassed
he
his
face
over
his
plate
there
was
hard
of
grief
in
his
throat
and
he
couldn
it
kay
chair
legs
scraped
on
the
floor
he
hoped
that
she
was
off
to
the
bathroom
but
then
felt
her
arms
around
his
shoulders
drawing
him
to
her
without
thinking
he
put
single
arm
around
her
too
it
was
so
good
to
be
held
if
only
their
relationship
could
be
into
simple
of
comfort
why
had
ever
learned
to
talk
he
had
onto
the
back
of
her
top
sorry
he
said
wiping
it
away
with
his
he
from
her
and
blew
his
nose
she
dragged
her
chair
to
sit
beside
him
and
put
hand
on
his
arm
he
liked
her
so
much
better
when
she
was
silent
and
her
face
was
soft
and
concerned
as
it
was
now
still
can
he
was
good
bloke
he
said
barry
he
was
good
bloke
yes
everyone
says
that
about
him
said
kay
she
had
never
been
allowed
to
meet
this
famous
barry
fairbrother
but
she
was
by
the
show
of
emotion
from
gavin
and
by
the
person
who
had
caused
it
was
he
funny
she
asked
because
she
could
imagine
gavin
in
to
to
up
the
bar
yeah
well
not
particularly
normal
he
liked
laugh
but
he
was
just
such
such
nice
bloke
he
liked
people
you
know
she
waited
but
gavin
did
not
seem
able
to
further
on
the
of
barry
and
the
kids
and
mary
poor
mary
god
you
ve
got
no
idea
kay
continued
to
his
arm
gently
but
her
sympathy
had
chilled
little
no
idea
she
thought
what
it
was
to
be
alone
no
idea
how
hard
it
was
to
be
left
in
charge
of
family
where
was
his
pity
for
her
kay
they
were
really
happy
said
gavin
in
cracked
voice
she
in
pieces
kay
his
arm
that
she
had
never
been
able
to
afford
to
go
to
pieces
all
right
he
said
wiping
his
nose
on
his
and
picking
up
his
by
the
smallest
of
he
indicated
that
she
should
remove
her
hand
iv
samantha
dinner
invitation
to
kay
had
been
by
mixture
of
and
she
saw
it
as
against
miles
who
was
always
busy
with
in
which
he
gave
her
no
say
but
with
which
he
expected
her
to
co
operate
she
wanted
to
see
how
he
liked
it
when
she
arranged
things
without
consulting
him
then
she
would
be
march
on
maureen
and
shirley
those
old
who
were
so
fascinated
by
gavin
private
affairs
but
knew
next
to
nothing
about
the
relationship
between
him
and
his
london
finally
it
would
afford
her
another
opportunity
to
her
on
gavin
for
being
and
about
his
love
life
she
might
talk
about
in
front
of
kay
or
say
how
nice
it
was
to
see
gavin
making
commitment
at
last
however
her
plans
for
the
of
others
gave
samantha
less
pleasure
than
she
had
hoped
when
on
saturday
morning
she
told
miles
what
she
had
done
he
with
suspicious
enthusiasm
great
yeah

haven

and
nice
for
you

get

know
kay
why
well
you
always
got

didn
you
miles
hated

she
glared
at
him
wondering
where
all
this
good
humour
was
coming
from
lexie
and
libby
home
for
the
weekend
and
up
in
the
house
because
of
the
rain
were
watching
music
in
the
sitting
room
through
to
the
kitchen
where
their
parents
stood
talking
listen
said
miles
his
mobile
aubrey
wants
to
have
talk
with
me
about
the
council
ve
just
called
dad
and
the
fawleys
have
invited
us
all
to
dinner
tonight
at
sweetlove
no
thanks
said
samantha
cutting
him
off
she
was
suddenly
full
of
fury
she
could
barely
explain
even
to
herself
she
walked
out
of
the
room
they
in
low
voices
all
over
the
house
through
the
day
trying
not
to
their
daughters
weekend
samantha
refused
to
change
her
mind
or
to
discuss
her
reasons
miles
afraid
of
getting
angry
at
her
was
and
cold
how
do
you
think
it
going
to
look
if
you
don
come
he
said
at
ten
to
eight
that
evening
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
sitting
room
ready
to
leave
wearing
suit
and
tie
it
nothing
to
do
with
me
miles
samantha
said
you
re
the
one
running
for
office
she
liked
watching
him
she
knew
that
he
was
terrified
of
being
late
yet
wondering
whether
he
could
still
persuade
her
to
go
with
him
you
know
they
ll
be
expecting
both
of
us
really
nobody
sent
me
an
invitation
oh
come
off
it
sam
you
know
they
meant
they
took
it
for
granted
more
fool
them
then
ve
told
you
don
fancy
it
you
better
hurry
you
don
want
to
keep
mummy
and
waiting
he
left
she
listened
to
the
car
out
of
the
drive
then
went
into
the
kitchen
opened
bottle
of
wine
and
brought
it
back
into
the
sitting
room
with
glass
she
kept
howard
shirley
and
miles
all
having
dinner
together
at
sweetlove
house
it
would
surely
be
the
first
shirley
had
had
in
years
her
thoughts
to
what
her
accountant
had
said
to
her
during
the
week
were
way
down
whatever
she
had
pretended
to
howard
the
accountant
had
actually
suggested
closing
the
shop
and
on
the
online
side
of
the
business
this
would
be
an
admission
of
failure
that
samantha
was
not
prepared
to
make
for
one
thing
shirley
would
love
it
if
the
shop
closed
she
had
been
bitch
about
it
from
the
start
sorry
sam
it
not
really
my
taste
just
bit
over
the
top
but
samantha
loved
her
little
red
and
black
shop
in
yarvil
loved
getting
away
from
pagford
every
day
to
customers
gossiping
with
her
assistant
her
world
would
be
tiny
without
the
shop
she
had
for
fourteen
years
it
would
in
short
to
pagford
pagford
bloody
pagford
samantha
had
never
meant
to
live
here
she
and
miles
had
planned
year
out
before
starting
work
round
the
world
trip
they
had
their
out
their
ready
samantha
had
dreamed
about
walking
and
hand
in
hand
on
long
white
and
then
she
had
found
out
that
she
was
pregnant
she
had
come
down
to
visit
him
at
day
after
she
had
taken
the
pregnancy
test
one
week
after
their
they
were
supposed
to
be
leaving
for
in
eight
days
time
samantha
had
not
wanted
to
tell
miles
in
his
parents
house
she
was
afraid
that
they
would
shirley
seemed
to
be
behind
every
door
samantha
opened
in
the
bungalow
so
she
waited
until
they
were
sitting
at
dark
corner
table
in
the
black
canon
she
remembered
the
rigid
line
of
miles
jaw
when
she
told
him
he
seemed
in
some
way
to
become
older
as
the
news
hit
him
he
did
not
speak
for
several
seconds
then
he
said
right
we
ll
get
married
he
told
her
that
he
had
already
bought
her
ring
that
he
had
been
planning
to
propose
somewhere
good
somewhere
like
the
top
of
sure
enough
when
they
got
back
to
the
bungalow
he
the
little
box
from
where
he
had
already
hidden
it
in
his
it
was
small
from
in
yarvil
he
had
bought
it
with
some
of
the
money
his
grandmother
had
left
him
samantha
had
sat
on
the
edge
of
miles
bed
and
cried
and
cried
they
had
married
three
months
later
alone
with
her
bottle
of
wine
samantha
turned
on
the
television
it
brought
up
the
lexie
and
libby
had
been
watching
image
of
four
young
men
singing
to
her
in
tight
shirts
they
looked
barely
out
of
their
she
pressed
play
after
the
boys
finished
their
song
the
cut
to
an
interview
samantha
back
her
wine
watching
the
band
joking
with
each
other
then
becoming
as
they
discussed
how
much
they
loved
their
she
thought
that
she
would
have
known
them
as
even
if
the
sound
had
been
off
their
teeth
were
perfect
it
late
she
paused
the
went
upstairs
and
