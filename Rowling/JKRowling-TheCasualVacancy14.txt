shouted
like
my
letter
said
miles
you
re
not
fit
to
fill
barry
fairbrother
shoes
he
was
your
letter
he
said
she
said
breathlessly
with
her
hand
on
the
sent
that
letter
too
much
to
drink
one
evening
while
you
were
on
the
phone
to
your
mother
and
she
pulled
the
door
open
didn
vote
for
you
either
the
look
on
his
face
unnerved
her
out
in
the
hall
she
slipped
on
the
first
pair
of
shoes
she
could
find
and
was
through
the
front
door
before
he
could
catch
up
ix
the
journey
took
krystal
back
to
her
childhood
she
had
made
this
trip
daily
to
st
thomas
all
on
her
own
on
the
bus
she
knew
when
the
abbey
would
come
into
sight
and
she
pointed
it
out
to
robbie
see
the
big
robbie
was
hungry
but
slightly
by
the
excitement
of
being
on
bus
krystal
held
his
hand
tightly
she
had
promised
him
food
when
they
got
off
at
the
other
end
but
she
did
not
know
where
she
would
get
it
perhaps
she
could
money
from
fats
for
bag
of
not
to
mention
the
return
bus
fare
ter
school
ere
she
told
robbie
while
he
wiped
his
fingers
on
the
dirty
windows
making
an
you
ll
go
to
school
ere
too
when
they
her
because
of
her
pregnancy
they
were
almost
certain
to
give
her
another
fields
house
nobody
wanted
to
buy
them
they
were
so
run
down
but
krystal
saw
this
as
good
thing
because
in
spite
of
their
it
would
put
robbie
and
the
baby
in
the
area
for
st
thomas
anyway
fats
parents
would
almost
certainly
give
her
enough
money
for
washing
machine
once
she
had
their
they
might
even
get
television
the
bus
rolled
down
towards
pagford
and
krystal
caught
glimpse
of
the
glittering
river
briefly
visible
before
the
road
sank
too
low
she
had
been
disappointed
when
she
joined
the
rowing
team
that
they
did
not
train
on
the
but
on
the
dirty
old
canal
in
yarvil
ere
we
are
krystal
told
robbie
as
the
bus
turned
slowly
into
the
square
fats
had
forgotten
that
waiting
in
front
of
the
black
canon
meant
standing
opposite
mollison
and
lowe
and
the
copper
kettle
there
was
more
than
an
hour
to
go
until
midday
when
the
caf√©
opened
on
but
fats
did
not
know
how
early
andrew
had
to
arrive
for
work
he
had
no
desire
to
see
his
oldest
friend
this
morning
so
he
down
the
side
of
the
pub
out
of
sight
and
only
emerged
when
the
bus
arrived
it
pulled
away
revealing
krystal
and
small
dirty
looking
boy
fats
towards
them
my
brother
said
krystal
aggressively
in
response
to
something
she
had
seen
in
fats
face
fats
made
another
mental
to
what
and
authentic
life
meant
he
had
been
taken
with
the
idea
of
knocking
krystal
up
and
showing
cubby
what
real
men
were
able
to
achieve
casually
without
effort
but
this
little
boy
clinging
to
his
sister
hand
and
leg
him
fats
wished
that
he
had
not
agreed
to
meet
her
she
was
making
him
ridiculous
he
would
rather
have
gone
back
to
that
house
of
hers
now
that
he
saw
her
in
the
square
ave
yeh
got
any
money
krystal
demanded
what
said
fats
his
were
slow
with
tiredness
he
could
not
remember
now
why
he
had
wanted
to
sit
up
all
night
his
tongue
was
with
all
the
cigarettes
he
had
smoked
money
repeated
krystal
an
ve
lost
pay
yeh
back
fats
stuck
hand
in
his
jeans
pocket
and
touched
crumpled
bank
note
somehow
he
did
not
want
to
look
too
flush
in
front
of
krystal
so
he
deeper
for
change
and
finally
came
up
with
small
amount
of
silver
and
they
went
to
the
tiny
newsagent
two
streets
from
the
square
and
fats
hung
around
outside
while
krystal
bought
robbie
and
packet
of
none
of
them
said
word
not
even
robbie
who
seemed
of
fats
at
last
when
krystal
had
handed
her
brother
the
she
said
to
fats
where
ll
we
go
surely
he
thought
she
could
not
mean
that
they
were
going
to
shag
not
with
the
boy
there
he
had
had
some
idea
of
taking
her
to
the
cubby
hole
it
was
private
and
it
would
be
final
of
his
and
andrew
friendship
he
owed
nothing
to
anyone
any
more
but
he
at
the
idea
of
fucking
in
front
of
three
year
old
ll
be
all
right
said
krystal
got
now
no
later
she
said
to
robbie
who
was
whining
for
the
still
in
her
hand
when
you
ve
ad
the
they
walked
off
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
old
stone
bridge
ll
be
all
right
krystal
repeated
does
as
told
she
said
loudly
to
robbie
wan
he
said
yeah
in
minute
she
could
tell
that
fats
needed
today
she
had
known
on
the
bus
that
bringing
robbie
however
necessary
would
be
difficult
bin
up
ter
she
asked
party
last
night
said
fats
yeah
who
wuz
there
he
and
she
had
to
wait
for
an
answer
arf
price
sukhvinder
jawanda
gaia
bawden
does
she
live
in
pagford
asked
krystal
sharply
yeah
in
hope
street
said
fats
he
knew
because
andrew
had
let
it
slip
where
she
lived
andrew
had
never
said
that
he
liked
her
but
fats
had
watched
him
watching
gaia
almost
constantly
in
the
few
classes
they
shared
he
had
noticed
andrew
self
consciousness
around
her
and
whenever
she
was
mentioned
krystal
though
was
thinking
about
gaia
mother
the
only
social
worker
she
had
ever
liked
the
only
one
who
had
got
through
to
her
mother
she
lived
in
hope
street
the
same
as
nana
cath
she
was
probably
there
right
now
what
if
but
kay
had
left
them
mattie
was
their
social
worker
again
anyway
you
weren
supposed
to
bother
them
at
home
tully
had
once
followed
his
social
worker
to
her
house
and
he
got
order
for
his
but
then
had
earlier
tried
to
brick
through
the
woman
car
window
and
krystal
as
the
road
turned
and
the
river
her
eyes
with
thousands
of
white
of
light
kay
was
still
the
of
the
and
the
judge
she
had
seemed
all
right
but
none
of
her
would
keep
krystal
and
robbie
together
we
could
go
down
there
she
suggested
to
fats
pointing
at
the
stretch
of
bank
little
way
along
from
the
bridge
an
robbie
could
wait
up
there
on
the
she
would
be
able
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
from
there
she
thought
and
she
would
make
sure
he
didn
see
anything
not
that
it
was
anything
he
had
not
seen
before
in
the
days
that
terri
brought
strangers
home
but
exhausted
as
he
was
fats
was
he
could
not
do
it
in
the
grass
under
the
eye
of
small
boy
he
said
trying
to
sound
won
bother
said
krystal
got
is
won
even
know
she
said
although
she
thought
that
was
lie
robbie
knew
too
much
there
had
been
trouble
at
nursery
when
he
doing
it
on
another
child
krystal
mother
fats
remembered
was
he
hated
the
idea
of
what
she
was
suggesting
but
was
that
not
krystal
asked
him
aggressively
nothing
he
said
dane
tully
would
do
it
would
do
it
cubby
not
in
million
years
krystal
walked
robbie
to
the
fats
bent
to
over
the
back
of
it
down
to
the
patch
of
and
bushes
and
thought
that
the
kid
might
not
see
anything
but
that
he
would
be
as
quick
as
he
could
in
any
case
ere
are
krystal
told
robbie
pulling
out
the
long
tube
of
while
he
reached
for
them
yeh
can
ave
all
of
em
if
yeh
jus
sit
ere
fer
minute
all
righ
yeh
jus
sit
ere
robbie
an
ll
be
in
them
bushes
yeh
understand
robbie
yeah
he
said
happily
his
cheeks
already
full
of
chocolate
and
krystal
slipped
and
slid
down
the
bank
towards
the
patch
of
hoping
that
fats
was
not
going
to
make
any
about
doing
it
without
gavin
was
wearing
against
the
glare
of
the
morning
sun
but
that
was
no
samantha
mollison
was
sure
to
recognize
his
car
when
he
caught
sight
of
her
striding
along
the
pavement
alone
with
her
hands
in
her
pockets
and
her
head
down
gavin
made
sharp
left
turn
and
instead
of
continuing
along
the
road
to
mary
crossed
the
old
stone
bridge
and
parked
up
side
lane
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
he
did
not
want
samantha
to
see
him
parking
outside
mary
house
it
did
not
matter
on
work
days
when
he
wore
suit
and
carried
briefcase
it
had
not
mattered
before
he
had
admitted
to
himself
what
he
felt
about
mary
but
it
mattered
now
in
any
case
the
morning
was
glorious
and
walk
bought
him
time
still
keeping
my
open
he
thought
as
he
crossed
the
bridge
on
foot
there
was
small
boy
sitting
by
himself
on
eating
below
him
don
have
to
say
anything
ll
play
it
by
ear
but
his
were
wet
the
thought
of
gaia
telling
the
fairbrother
twins
that
he
was
in
love
with
their
mother
had
him
all
through
restless
night
mary
seemed
pleased
to
see
him
where
your
car
she
asked
peering
over
his
shoulder
parked
it
down
by
the
river
he
said
lovely
morning
fancied
walk
and
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
could
the
lawn
if
you
oh
did
it
for
me
she
said
but
that
so
sweet
of
you
come
in
and
have
coffee
she
as
she
moved
around
the
kitchen
she
was
wearing
old
cut
off
jeans
and
shirt
they
showed
how
thin
she
was
but
her
hair
was
shiny
again
the
way
he
usually
thought
of
it
he
could
see
the
twin
girls
lying
out
on
the
freshly
lawn
on
both
with
in
listening
to
their
how
are
you
mary
asked
sitting
down
beside
him
he
could
not
think
why
she
sounded
so
concerned
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
found
time
to
tell
her
yesterday
during
his
brief
visit
that
he
and
kay
had
split
up
ok
he
said
probably
for
the
best
she
smiled
and
patted
his
arm
heard
last
night
he
said
his
mouth
little
dry
that
you
might
be
moving
news
fast
in
pagford
she
said
it
just
an
idea
wants
me
to
move
back
to
and
how
do
the
kids
feel
about
that
well
wait
for
the
girls
and
fergus
to
do
their
in
declan
not
so
much
of
problem
mean
none
of
us
wants
to
leave
she
into
tears
in
front
of
him
but
he
was
so
happy
that
he
reached
out
to
touch
her
delicate
wrist
of
course
you
don
barry
grave
ah
said
gavin
his
happiness
out
like
mary
wiped
her
eyes
on
the
back
of
her
hand
gavin
found
her
little
his
family
their
dead
barry
had
only
been
the
second
he
had
ever
attended
and
he
had
hated
everything
about
it
gavin
saw
grave
purely
as
for
the
place
where
corpse
was
nasty
thought
yet
people
took
it
into
their
heads
to
visit
and
bring
flowers
as
though
it
might
yet
recover
she
had
got
up
to
get
tissues
outside
on
the
lawn
the
twins
had
switched
to
set
of
their
heads
up
and
down
in
time
to
the
same
song
so
miles
got
barry
seat
she
said
could
hear
the
all
the
way
up
here
last
night
well
it
was
howard
yeah
that
right
said
gavin
and
pagford
nearly
rid
of
the
fields
she
said
yeah
looks
like
it
and
now
miles
is
on
the
council
it
ll
be
easier
to
close
bellchapel
she
said
gavin
always
had
to
remind
himself
what
bellchapel
was
he
had
no
interest
in
these
issues
at
all
yeah
suppose
so
so
everything
barry
wanted
is
finished
she
said
her
tears
had
dried
up
and
the
patches
of
high
angry
colour
had
returned
to
her
cheeks
know
he
said
it
really
sad
don
know
she
said
still
flushed
and
angry
why
should
pagford
pick
up
the
bills
for
the
fields
barry
only
ever
saw
one
side
of
it
he
thought
everyone
in
the
fields
was
like
him
he
thought
krystal
weedon
was
like
him
but
she
wasn
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
people
in
the
fields
might
be
happy
where
they
are
yeah
said
gavin
that
she
with
barry
and
feeling
as
if
the
shadow
of
his
grave
had
lifted
from
between
them
know
what
you
mean
from
all
ve
heard
about
krystal
weedon
she
got
more
of
his
time
and
his
attention
than
his
own
daughters
said
mary
and
she
never
even
gave
for
his
the
girls
told
me
the
whole
rowing
team
in
except
krystal
and
she
didn
come
to
his
funeral
even
after
all
he
done
for
her
yeah
well
that
shows
sorry
but
can
stop
thinking
about
it
all
she
said
can
stop
thinking
that
he
still
want
me
to
worry
about
bloody
krystal
weedon
can
get
past
it
all
the
last
day
of
his
life
and
he
had
and
he
didn
do
anything
about
it
writing
that
bloody
article
know
said
gavin
know
think
he
said
with
sense
of
putting
his
foot
on
an
old
bridge
it
bloke
thing
miles
is
the
same
samantha
didn
want
him
to
stand
for
the
council
but
he
went
ahead
anyway
you
know
some
men
really
like
bit
of
power
barry
wasn
in
it
for
power
said
mary
and
gavin
hastily
no
no
barry
wasn
he
was
in
it
for
he
couldn
help
himself
she
said
he
thought
everyone
was
like
him
that
if
you
gave
them
hand
they
start
themselves
yeah
said
gavin
but
the
point
is
there
are
other
people
who
could
use
hand
people
at
home
well
exactly
said
mary
yet
again
into
tears
mary
said
gavin
leaving
his
chair
moving
to
her
side
on
the
bridge
now
with
sense
of
mingled
panic
and
anticipation
look
it
really
early
mean
it
far
too
soon
but
you
ll
meet
someone
else
at
forty
sobbed
mary
with
four
children
plenty
of
men
he
began
but
that
was
no
good
he
would
rather
she
did
not
think
she
had
too
many
the
right
man
he
himself
won
care
that
you
ve
got
kids
anyway
they
re
such
nice
kids
anyone
would
be
glad
to
take
them
on
oh
gavin
you
re
so
sweet
she
said
her
eyes
again
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
she
did
not
it
off
they
stood
without
speaking
while
she
blew
her
nose
and
then
he
felt
her
tense
to
move
away
and
he
said
mary
what
ve
got
to
mary
think
in
love
with
you
he
knew
for
few
seconds
the
glorious
pride
of
the
who
off
firm
floor
into
space
then
she
pulled
away
gavin
sorry
he
said
with
alarm
her
expression
wanted
you
to
hear
it
from
me
told
kay
that
why
wanted
to
split
up
and
was
scared
you
hear
it
from
someone
else
wouldn
have
said
anything
for
months
years
he
added
trying
to
bring
back
her
smile
and
the
mood
in
which
she
found
him
sweet
but
mary
was
shaking
her
head
arms
folded
over
her
thin
chest
gavin
never
ever
forget
said
anything
he
said
let
just
forget
it
thought
you
understood
she
said
he
gathered
that
he
should
have
known
that
she
was
in
the
invisible
of
grief
and
that
it
ought
to
have
protected
her
do
understand
he
lied
wouldn
have
told
you
only
barry
always
said
you
fancied
me
said
mary
didn
he
said
gavin
think
you
re
such
nice
man
she
said
breathlessly
but
don
mean
even
if
no
he
said
loudly
trying
to
her
out
understand
listen
going
to
go
there
no
need
but
he
almost
hated
her
now
he
had
heard
what
she
was
trying
to
say
even
if
weren
for
my
husband
wouldn
want
you
his
visit
had
been
so
brief
that
when
mary
slightly
shaky
poured
away
his
coffee
it
was
still
hot
howard
had
told
shirley
that
he
did
not
feel
well
that
he
thought
he
had
better
stay
in
bed
and
rest
and
that
the
copper
kettle

an
afternoon

he
said
no
ll
call
her
said
shirley
sharply
as
she
closed
the
bedroom
door
on
him
shirley
thought
he
using
his
heart
he
had
said
don
be
silly
and
then
it
rubbish
bloody
rubbish
and
she
had
not
pressed
him
years
of
of
shirley
had
been
struck
dumb
when
twenty
three
year
old
patricia
had
said
mum
seemed
to
have
something
inside
her
the
doorbell
rang
lexie
said
dad
told
me
to
come
round
here
he
and
mum
have
got
something
to
do
where
in
bed
said
shirley
he
it
bit
last
night
it
was
good
party

lexie

said
shirley
with
building
inside
her
after
while
her
granddaughter
wore
shirley
down
let
have
lunch
at
the
caf√©
she
suggested
howard
she
called
through
the
closed
bedroom
door
taking
lexie
for
lunch
at
the
copper
kettle
he
sounded
worried
and
she
was
glad
she
was
not
afraid
of
maureen
she
would
look
maureen
right
in
the
face
but
it
occurred
to
shirley
as
she
walked
that
howard
might
have
telephoned
maureen
the
moment
she
had
left
the
bungalow
she
was
so
stupid
somehow
she
had
thought
that
in
calling
maureen
herself
about
howard
illness
she
had
stopped
them
she
was
forgetting
the
familiar
well
loved
streets
seemed
different
strange
she
had
taken
regular
of
the
window
she
presented
to
this
lovely
little
world
wife
and
mother
hospital
secretary
to
the
parish
council
first
and
pagford
had
been
her
mirror
in
its
polite
respect
her
and
her
worth
but
the
ghost
had
taken
and
smeared
across
the
pristine
surface
of
her
life
that
would
it
all
her
husband
was
sleeping
with
his
business
partner
and
she
never
knew
it
would
be
all
that
anyone
said
when
she
was
mentioned
all
that
they
ever
remembered
about
her
she
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
caf√©
the
bell
tinkled
and
lexie
said
there
peanut
price
howard
all
right
croaked
maureen
just
tired
said
shirley
moving
smoothly
to
table
and
sitting
down
her
heart
beating
so
fast
that
she
wondered
whether
she
might
have
herself
tell
him
neither
of
the
girls
has
turned
up
said
maureen
by
their
table
and
neither
of
them
bothered
to
call
in
either
it
lucky
we
re
not
busy
lexie
went
to
the
counter
to
talk
to
andrew
who
had
been
put
on
duty
conscious
of
her
unusual
solitude
as
she
sat
alone
at
the
table
shirley
remembered
mary
fairbrother
and
at
barry
funeral
draped
around
her
like
queen
train
the
pity
the
admiration
in
losing
her
husband
mary
had
become
the
silent
of
admiration
she
to
man
who
had
betrayed
her
was
in
of
long
ago
in
yarvil
men
had
shirley
to
jokes
because
of
her
mother
reputation
even
though
she
shirley
had
been
as
as
it
was
possible
to
be
feeling
ill
lexie
was
telling
andrew
what
in
those
he
bent
down
behind
the
counter
hiding
his
red
face
your
mum
andrew
had
almost
off
work
he
had
been
afraid
that
howard
might
sack
him
on
the
spot
for
kissing
his
daughter
in
law
and
was
terrified
that
miles
mollison
might
in
looking
for
him
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
so
naive
that
he
did
not
know
that
samantha
who
must
he
thought
be
well
over
forty
would
figure
as
the
of
the
piece
his
defence
was
simple
she
was
pissed
and
she
grabbed
me
there
was
tiny
of
pride
in
his
embarrassment
he
had
been
anxious
to
see
gaia
he
wanted
to
tell
her
that
grown
woman
had
on
him
he
had
hoped
that
they
might
laugh
about
it
the
way
that
they
laughed
about
maureen
but
that
she
might
be
impressed
and
also
that
in
the
course
of
laughing
he
might
find
out
exactly
what
she
had
done
with
fats
how
far
she
had
let
him
go
he
was
prepared
to
forgive
her
she
had
been
pissed
too
but
she
had
not
turned
up
he
went
to
fetch
for
lexie
and
almost
with
his
boss
wife
who
was
standing
behind
the
counter
holding
his
howard
wanted
me
to
check
something
shirley
told
him
and
this
needle
shouldn
be
kept
in
here
ll
put
it
in
the
back
halfway
down
his
packet
of
robbie
became
extremely
krystal
had
not
bought
him
drink
he
climbed
off
the
and
down
in
the
warm
grass
where
he
could
still
see
her
in
the
bushes
with
the
stranger
after
while
he
scrambled
down
the
bank
towards
them
he
robbie
get
out
of
it
screamed
krystal

an
sit
on
the
wanna
drink
fuckin
go
an
by
the
an
ll
drink
in
minute
go
way
robbie
crying
he
climbed
back
up
the
slippery
bank
to
the
he
was
to
not
being
given
what
he
wanted
and
by
habit
because
grown
ups
were
in
their
and
their
rules
so
he
had
learned
to
his
tiny
wherever
and
whenever
he
could
angry
at
krystal
he
little
way
from
the
along
the
road
man
in
was
walking
along
the
pavement
towards
him
gavin
had
forgotten
where
he
had
parked
the
car
he
had
marched
out
of
mary
and
walked
straight
down
church
row
only
that
he
was
heading
in
the
wrong
direction
when
he
drew
level
with
miles
and
samantha
house
not
wanting
to
pass
the
fairbrothers
again
he
had
taken
route
back
to
the
bridge
he
saw
the
boy
chocolate
stained
ill
and
and
walked
past
with
his
happiness
in
half
that
he
could
have
gone
to
kay
house
and
been
silently
she
had
always
been
to
him
when
he
was
miserable
it
was
what
had
him
to
her
in
the
first
place
the
rushing
of
the
river
increased
robbie
he
cried
bit
more
as
he
changed
direction
and
headed
away
from
the
bridge
back
past
the
place
where
krystal
was
hidden
the
bushes
had
started
shaking
he
walked
on
wanting
drink
then
noticed
hole
in
long
hedge
on
the
left
of
the
road
when
he
drew
level
he
spotted
playing
field
beyond
robbie
through
the
hole
and
contemplated
the
wide
green
space
with
its
spreading
tree
and
robbie
knew
what
they
were
because
his
cousin
dane
had
showed
him
how
to
kick
football
at
the
play
park
he
had
never
seen
so
much
woman
came
striding
across
the
field
with
her
arms
folded
and
her
head
samantha
had
been
walking
at
walking
and
walking
anywhere
as
long
as
it
was
nowhere
near
church
row
she
had
been
asking
herself
many
questions
and
coming
up
with
few
and
one
of
the
questions
she
asked
herself
was
whether
she
might
not
have
gone
too
far
in
telling
miles
about
that
stupid
letter
which
she
had
sent
out
of
spite
and
which
seemed
much
less
clever
now
she
glanced
up
and
her
eyes
met
robbie
children
often
through
the
hole
in
the
hedge
to
play
in
the
field
at
weekends
her
own
girls
had
done
it
when
they
were
younger
she
climbed
over
the
gate
and
turned
away
from
the
river
towards
the
square
self
disgust
clung
to
her
no
matter
how
hard
she
tried
to
it
robbie
went
back
through
the
hole
in
the
hedge
and
walked
little
way
along
the
road
after
the
striding
lady
but
she
was
soon
out
of
sight
the
half
packet
of
remaining
were
in
his
hand
and
he
did
not
want
to
put
them
down
but
he
was
so
maybe
krystal
had
finished
he
back
in
the
opposite
direction
when
he
reached
the
first
patch
of
bushes
on
the
bank
he
saw
that
they
were
not
moving
so
he
thought
it
was
all
right
to
approach
krystal
he
said
but
the
bushes
were
empty
krystal
was
gone
robbie
started
to
and
shout
for
krystal
he
back
up
the
bank
and
looked
up
and
down
the
road
but
there
was
no
sign
of
her
krystal
he
yelled
woman
with
short
silver
hair
glanced
at
him
as
she
briskly
along
the
opposite
pavement
shirley
had
left
lexie
at
the
copper
kettle
where
she
seemed
happy
but
short
way
across
the
square
she
had
caught
glimpse
of
samantha
who
was
the
very
last
person
she
wanted
to
meet
so
she
had
taken
off
in
the
opposite
direction
the
boy
and
echoed
behind
her
as
she
hurried
along
shirley
fist
was
clutched
tightly
around
the
in
her
pocket
she
would
not
be
dirty
joke
she
wanted
to
be
and
like
mary
fairbrother
her
rage
was
so
enormous
so
dangerous
that
she
could
not
think
she
wanted
to
act
to
punish
to
finish
just
before
the
old
stone
bridge
patch
of
bushes
to
shirley
left
she
glanced
down
and
caught
glimpse
of
something
and
and
it
drove
her
on
sukhvinder
had
been
walking
around
pagford
longer
than
samantha
she
had
left
the
old
vicarage
shortly
after
her
mother
had
told
her
she
must
go
to
work
and
since
then
had
been
wandering
the
streets
invisible
around
church
row
hope
street
and
the
square
she
had
nearly
fifty
pounds
in
her
pocket
which
represented
her
wages
from
the
caf√©
and
the
party
and
the
blade
she
had
wanted
to
take
her
building
pass
book
which
in
little
cabinet
in
her
father
study
but
vikram
had
been
at
his
desk
she
had
waited
for
while
at
the
bus
stop
where
you
could
catch
bus
into
yarvil
but
then
she
had
spotted
shirley
and
lexie
mollison
coming
down
the
road
and
out
of
sight
gaia
betrayal
had
been
brutal
and
unexpected
pulling
fats
wall
he
would
drop
krystal
now
that
he
had
gaia
any
boy
would
drop
any
girl
for
gaia
she
knew
that
but
she
could
not
bear
to
go
to
work
and
hear
her
one
trying
to
tell
her
that
fats
was
all
right
really
her
mobile
gaia
had
already
her
twice
how
pissed
was
last
going
work
nothing
about
fats
wall
nothing
about
sukhvinder
the
new
message
said
ok
sukhvinder
put
the
mobile
back
into
her
pocket
she
might
walk
towards
yarvil
and
catch
bus
outside
town
where
nobody
would
see
her
her
parents
would
not
miss
her
until
five
thirty
when
they
expected
her
home
from
the
caf√©
desperate
plan
formed
as
she
walked
hot
and
tired
if
she
could
find
place
to
stay
that
cost
less
than
fifty
pounds
all
she
wanted
was
to
be
alone
and
her
blade
she
was
on
the
river
road
with
the
flowing
beside
her
if
she
crossed
the
bridge
she
would
be
able
to
take
back

the
way
round
to
the
start
of
the

terrified
that
one
of

sukhvinder
caught
sight
of
something
in
the
river
below
her
hands
were
already
on
the
hot
stone
before
she
had
thought
about
what
she
was
doing
and
then
she
had
herself
onto
the
edge
of
the
bridge
she
yelled
he
in
the
river
krys
and
dropped
feet
first
into
the
water
her
leg
was
open
by
broken
computer

as
she
was
pulled
under
by
the
when
shirley
opened
the
bedroom

she
saw
nothing
but
two
empty
beds
justice
required
sleeping
howard
she
would
have
to
him
to
return
to
bed
but
there
was
no
sound
from
either
the
kitchen
or
the
bathroom
shirley
was
worried
that
by
taking
the
river
road
home
she
had
missed
him
he
must
have
got
dressed
and
set
off
for
work
he
might
already
be
with
maureen
in
the
back
room
discussing
shirley
planning
perhaps
to
divorce
her
and
marry
maureen
instead
now
that
the

was
up
and
was
ended
she
half
ran

see
the
very
patch
of
skin
where
she
had
planned
to
the
needle
howard
eyes
met
hers
in
appeal
shirley
stared
at
him
terrified
then
out
of
the
room
at
first
she
hid
the
in
the
biscuit
then
she
it
and
shoved

said
andrew
automatically
because
that
was
his
and
fats
code
never
tell
the
parents
but
the
horror
of
what
she
had
just
told
him
crept
through
the
phone
like
everything
was
suddenly
less
clear
less
certain
she
was
about
to
hang
up
wait
mrs
wall
he
said

know
there
place
down
by
the
river
don
think
he
go
near
the
river
now
said
tessa
seconds
by
and
andrew
was
more
and
more
convinced
that
fats
was
in
the
cubby
hole
it
the
only
place
can
think
of
he
said
tell
me
where
have
to
show
you
ll
be
there
in
ten
minutes
she
shouted
colin
was
already
the
streets
of
pagford
on
foot
tessa
drove
the
up
the
hill
road
and
found
andrew
waiting
for
her
on
the
corner
where
he
usually
caught
the
bus
he
directed
her
down
through
the
town
the
street
lights
were
by
they
parked
by
the
trees
where
andrew
usually
threw
down
simon
racing
bike
tessa
got
out
of
the
car
and
followed
andrew
to
the
edge
of
the
water
puzzled
and
frightened
he
not
here
she
said
it
along
there
said
andrew
pointing
at
the
dark
face
of
hill
running
straight
down
to
the
river
with
barely
lip
of
bank
before
the
rushing
water
what
do
you
mean
asked
tessa
horrified
andrew
had
known
from
the
first
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
come
with
him
short
and
as
she
was
ll
go
and
see
he
said
if
you
wait
here
but
it
too
dangerous
she
cried
over
the
roar
of
the
powerful
river
ignoring
her
he
reached
for
the
familiar
hand
and
as
he
away
along
the
tiny
the
same
thought
came
to
both
of
them
that
fats
might
have
fallen
or
jumped
into
the
river
so
close
to
andrew
feet
tessa
remained
at
the
water
edge
until
she
could
not
make
andrew
out
any
longer
then
turned
away
trying
not
to
cry
in
case
stuart
was
there
and
she
needed
to
talk
to
him
calmly
for
the
first
time
she
wondered
where
krystal
was
the
police
had
not
said
and
her
terror
for
fats
had
every
other
concern
please
god
let
me
find
stuart
she
let
me
find
stuart
please
god
then
she
pulled
her
mobile
from
her
cardigan
pocket
and
called
kay
bawden
don
know
whether
you
ve
heard
she
shouted
over
the
rushing
water
and
she
told
kay
the
story
but
not
her
social
worker
any
more
said
kay
twenty
feet
away
andrew
had
reached
the
cubby
hole
it
was
black
he
had
never
been
here
this
late
he
swung
himself
inside
fats
he
heard
something
move
at
the
back
of
the
hole
fats
you
there
got
light
arf
said
an
voice
dropped
my
bloody
matches
andrew
thought
of
shouting
out
to
tessa
but
she
did
not
know
how
long
it
took
to
reach
the
cubby
hole
she
could
wait
few
more
moments
he
passed
over
his
lighter
by
its
flickering
flame
andrew
saw
that
his
friend
appearance
was
almost
as
changed
as
his
voice
fats
eyes
were
swollen
his
whole
face
looked
puffy
the
flame
went
out
fats
cigarette
bright
in
the
darkness
is
he
dead
her
brother
andrew
had
not
realized
that
fats
did
not
know
yeah
he
said
and
then
he
added
think
so
that
what
what
heard
there
was
silence
and
then
soft
like
reached
him
through
the
darkness
mrs
wall
yelled
andrew
sticking
his
head
out
of
the
hole
as
far
as
it
would
go
so
that
he
could
not
hear
fats
sobs
over
the
sound
of
the
river
mrs
wall
he
here
ii
the
had
been
gentle
and
kind
in
the
cluttered
cottage
by
the
river
where
water
now
covered
chairs
and
worn
the
old
lady
who
owned
the
place
had
brought
hot
water
bottle
and
cup
of
boiling
tea
which
sukhvinder
could
not
lift
because
she
was
shaking
like
she
had
of
information
her
own
name
and
krystal
name
and
the
name
of
the
dead
little
boy
that
they
were
onto
an
ambulance
the
dog
who
had
pulled
her
from
the
river
was
rather
he
gave
statement
to
the
police
in
the
next
room
and
sukhvinder
hated
the
sound
of
his
account
he
had
his
dog
to
tree
outside
the
window
and
it
then
the
police
had
called
her
parents
and
they
had
come
parminder
knocking
over
table
and
one
of
the
old
lady
ornaments
as
she
crossed
the
room
with
clean
clothes
in
her
arms
in
the
tiny
bathroom
the
deep
dirty
on
sukhvinder
leg
was
revealed
the
bath
with
black
and
when
parminder
saw
the
wound
she
shrieked
at
vikram
who
was
everyone
loudly
in
the
hall
that
they
must
take
sukhvinder
to
the
hospital
she
had
again
in
the
car
and
her
mother
who
was
beside
her
in
the
back
seat
had
her
up
and
all
the
way
there
parminder
and
vikram
had
kept
up
flow
of
loud
talk
her
father
kept
himself
saying
things
like
she
ll
need
sedative
and
that
cut
will
definitely
need
and
parminder
who
was
in
the
back
seat
with
the
shaking
and
sukhvinder
kept
saying
you
might
have
died
you
might
have
died
it
was
as
if
she
was
still
sukhvinder
was
somewhere
she
could
not
breathe
she
tried
to
cut
through
it
all
to
be
heard
does
krystal
know
he
dead
she
asked
through
teeth
and
parminder
had
to
ask
her
to
the
question
several
times
don
know
she
answered
at
last
you
might
have
died
at
the
hospital
they
made
her
again
but
this
time
her
mother
was
with
her
in
the
and
she
realized
her
mistake
too
late
when
she
saw
the
expression
of
horror
on
parminder
face
my
god
she
said
sukhvinder
my
god
what
have
you
done
to
yourself
sukhvinder
had
no
words
so
she
allowed
herself
to
into
tears
and
shaking
and
vikram
shouted
at
everyone
including
parminder
to
leave
her
alone
but
also
to
damn
well
hurry
up
and
that
her
cut
needed
cleaning
and
she
needed
and
and
later
they
put
her
in
bed
with
parent
on
each
side
of
her
and
both
of
them
her
hands
she
was
warm
and
and
there
was
no
pain
in
her
leg
any
more
the
sky
beyond
the
windows
was
dark
howard
mollison
had
another
heart
attack
she
heard
her
mother
tell
her
father
miles
wanted
me
to
go
to
him
bloody
said
vikram
to
sukhvinder
surprise
they
talked
no
more
about
howard
mollison
they
merely
continued
to
stroke
her
hands
until
shortly
afterwards
she
fell
asleep
on
the
far
side
of
the
building
in
shabby
blue
room
with
plastic
chairs
and
fish
in
the
corner
miles
and
samantha
were
sitting
on
either
side
of
shirley
waiting
for
news
from
theatre
miles
was
still
wearing
his
can
believe
parminder
jawanda
wouldn
come
he
said
for
the
time
his
voice
samantha
got
up
moved
past
shirley
and
put
her
arms
around
miles
kissing
his
thick
hair
with
grey
breathing
in
his
familiar
smell
shirley
said
in
high
voice
not
surprised
she
wouldn
come
not
surprised
absolutely
appalling
all
she
had
left
of
her
old
life
and
her
old
was
familiar
shock
had
taken
almost
everything
from
her
she
no
longer
knew
what
to
believe
or
even
what
to
hope
the
man
in
theatre
was
not
the
man
she
had
thought
she
had
married
if
she
could
have
returned
to
that
happy
place
of
before
she
had
read
that
awful
post
perhaps
she
ought
to
shut
down
the
whole
website
take
away
the
message
boards
in
their
she
was
afraid
that
the
ghost
might
come
back
that
he
might
say
the
awful
thing
again
she
wanted
to
go
home
right
now
and
the
website
and
while
there
she
could
destroy
the
once
and
for
all
he
saw
it
know
he
saw
it
but
never
have
done
it
really
wouldn
have
done
it
was
upset
never
have
done
it
what
if
howard
and
his
first
words
were
she
ran
out
of
the
room
when
she
saw
me
she
didn
call
an
ambulance
straight
away
she
was
holding
big
needle
then
ll
say
his
brain

affected
shirley
thought
defiantly
and
if
he
died
beside
her
samantha
was
miles
shirley
did
not
like
it
she
ought
to
be
the
centre
of
attention
it
was
her
husband
who
was
lying
upstairs
fighting
for
his
life
she
had
wanted
to
be
like
mary
fairbrother
and
admired
this
was
not
how
she
had
imagined
it
shirley
ruth
price
in
her
nurse
uniform

come
hurrying
into
the
room
her
thin
face
with
sympathy
just

shirley
how
awful

shirley
getting
up
and
herself
to
be
that
so
kind

kind
shirley
liked
her
medical
friend
to
miles
and
samantha
and
receiving
her
pity
and
her
kindness
in
front
of
them
it
was
tiny
taste
of
how
she
had
imagined
but
then
ruth
had
to
go
back
to
work
and
shirley
returned
to
her
plastic
chair
and
her
uncomfortable
thoughts
he
ll
be
ok
samantha
was
to
miles
as
he
rested
his
head
on
her
shoulder

future

of
vikram
jawanda
nineteen
people
to
the
damage
while
the
to
which
howard
was
connected

soft
noises
that

far
below
in
the
of
the
hospital
robbie
weedon
body

drawer
iii
andrew
had
refused

back
to
hilltop
house
so
it
was
only
tessa
and
fats
in
the
car
together
and
fats
said
don
want
to
go
home
all
right
tessa
replied
and
she
drove
while
talking
to
colin
on
the
telephone
ve
got
him
andy
found
him
we
ll
be
back
in
bit
yes
yes
will
tears
were
down
fats
face
his
body
was
him
it
was
exactly
like
the
time
when
hot
had
spilt
down
his
leg
into
his
when
simon
price
had
made
him
piss
himself
the
hot
over
his
chin
and
onto
his
chest
like
of
rain
he
kept
imagining
the
funeral
tiny
little
coffin
he
had
not
wanted
to
do
it
with
the
boy
so
near
would
the
weight
of
the
dead
child
ever
lift
from
him
so
you
ran
away
said
tessa
coldly
over
his
tears
she
had
that
she
would
find
him
alive
but
her
emotion
was
disgust
his
tears
did
not
soften
her
she
was
used
to
men
tears
part
of
her
was
ashamed
that
he
had
not
after
all
thrown
himself
into
the
river
krystal
told
the
police
that
you
and
she
were
in
the
bushes
you
just
left
him
to
his
own
did
you
fats
was
he
could
not
believe
her
cruelty
did
she
not
understand
the
inside
him
the
horror
the
sense
of
well
hope
you
have
got
her
pregnant
said
tessa
it
ll
give
her
something
to
live
for
every
time
they
turned
corner
he
thought
that
she
was
taking
him
home
he
had
feared
cubby
most
but
now
there
was
nothing
to
choose
between
his
parents
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
car
but
she
had
locked
all
the
doors
without
warning
she
and
fats
clutching
the
sides
of
his
seat
saw
that
they
were
in
lay
by
on
the
yarvil
bypass
frightened
that
she
would
order
him
out
of
the
car
he
turned
his
swollen
face
to
her
your
birth
mother
she
said
looking
at
him
as
she
had
never
done
before
without
pity
or
kindness
was
fourteen
years
old
we
had
the
impression
from
what
we
were
told
that
she
was
middle
class
quite
bright
girl
she
absolutely
refused
to
say
who
your
father
was
nobody
knew
whether
she
was
trying
to
an
under
age
boyfriend
or
something
worse
we
were
told
all
of
this
in
case
you
had
any
mental
or
physical
in
case
she
said
clearly
like
teacher
trying
to
point
sure
to
come
up
in
test
you
had
been
the
result
of
he
away
from
her
he
would
have
preferred
to
be
shot
was
desperate
to
you
she
said
desperate
but
dad
was
very
ill
he
said
to
me
can
do
it
scared
ll
hurt
baby
need
to
get
better
before
we
do
this
and
can
do
that
and
cope
with
new
baby
as
well
but
was
so
determined
to
have
you
said
tessa
that
him
into
lying
and
telling
the
social
workers
that
he
was
fine
and
pretending
to
be
happy
and
normal
we
brought
you
home
and
you
were
tiny
and
premature
and
on
the
fifth
night
we
had
you
dad
slipped
out
of
bed
and
went
to
the
garage
put
on
the
of
the
car
and
tried
to
kill
himself
because
he
was
convinced
he
you
and
he
almost
died
so
you
can
blame
me
said
tessa
for
your
and
dad
bad
start
and
maybe
you
can
blame
me
for
everything
that
come
since
but
ll
tell
you
this
stuart
your
father
spent
his
life
facing
up
to
things
he
never
did
don
expect
you
to
understand
his
kind
of
courage
but
her
voice
broke
at
last
and
he
heard
the
mother
he
knew
he
you
stuart
she
added
the
lie
because
she
could
not
help
herself
tonight
for
the
first
time
tessa
was
convinced
that
it
was
lie
and
also
that
everything
she
had
done
in
her
life
telling
herself
that
it
was
for
the
best
had
been
no
more
than
confusion
and
mess
all
around
but
who
could
bear
to
know
which
stars
were
already
dead
she
thought
blinking
up
at
the
night
sky
could
anybody
stand
to
know
that
they
all
were
she
turned
the
key
in
the
crashed
the
and
they
pulled
out
again
onto
the
bypass
don
want
to
go
to
the
fields
said
fats
in
terror
we
re
not
going
to
the
fields
she
said
taking
you
home
iv
the
police
had
picked
up
krystal
weedon
at
last
as
she
ran
along
the
river
bank
on
the
very
edge
of
pagford
still
calling
her
brother
in
cracked
voice
the
who
approached
her
addressed
her
by
name
and
tried
to
break
the
news
to
her
gently
but
she
still
tried
to
beat
the
woman
away
from
her
and
in
the
end
the
had
almost
to
her
into
the
car
krystal
had
not
noticed
fats
away

for
days
and
they
had
no
all

long
they
had
and
almost
made

distance
when

neighbours
were
coming
out
onto
their
fascinated
to

somehow
the
cause
of

later
she
was
herself
into

glad
in

of
everything
that

by
the
time

found
what

trying
to
shut
the
two

never
shot
up
before
but
she
had
watched
it
happen
many
times
she
knew
about
and
how
to
make
model
and
she
knew
how
to
heat
the
spoon
and
about
the
tiny
little
ball
of
cotton
wool
you
used
to
up
the
dissolved
smack
and
act
as
when
you
were

knew
that
the
of
the
arm
was
the
best
place
to
find
and
she
knew
to
lay
the
needle
as
flat
as
possible
against
the
skin
she
knew
because
she
had
heard
it
said
many
times
that

not
take
what
could
manage
and
that
was
good
because
she
did
not
want
to
take
it
robbie
was
dead
and
it
was
her
fault
in
trying
to
save
him
she
had
killed
him
flickering
images
filled
her
mind
as
her
fingers
worked
to
achieve
what
must
be
done

alongside
the

in
his

for
her
at
the
window
of
his
foster
home
clean
jumping
up
and
down
with
excitement
as
she
approached
the
front
door
she
could
hear
the
policeman
calling
to
her
through
the
letter
box
not
to
be
silly
girl
and
the
trying
to
terri
and
cheryl
the
needle
slid
easily
into
krystal
she
pressed
the
down
hard
in
hope
and
without
regret
by
the
time
kay
and
gaia
arrived
and
the
police
decided
to
force
their
way
in

nearly
three
weeks
after
the
had
through
pagford
on
morning
in
shirley
mollison
stood
alone
in
her
bedroom
at
her
reflection
in
the
wardrobe
she
was
making
final
to
her
dress
before
her
now
daily
drive
to
south
west
general
the
belt
slid
up
hole
than
it
had
done
fortnight
ago
her
silver
hair
was
in
need
of
and
her
against
the
sunshine
blazing
into
the
room
could
have
been
simple
expression
of
her
mood
when
miles
accompanied
her
to
the
hospital
she
could
let
him
do
all
the
talking
to
howard
which
he
did
keeping
up
steady
of
pagford
news
she
felt
so
much
better
both
more
visible
and
more
protected
with
tall
miles
walking
beside
her
down
the
corridors
he
to
the
nurses
and
handed
her
in
and
out
of
the
car
and
to
her
the
sense
of
being
rare
worthy
of
care
and
but
miles
could
not
come
every
day
and
to
shirley
profound
irritation
he
kept
samantha
to
her
this
was
not
the
same
thing
at
all
even
though
samantha
was
one
of
the
few
who
managed
to
bring
smile
to
howard
purple
vacant
face
nobody
seemed
to
realize
how
dreadful
the
silence
was
at
home
either
when
the
doctors
had
told
the
family
that
would
take
months
shirley
had
hoped
that
miles
would
ask
her
to
move
into
the
spare
room
of
the
big
house
in
church
row
or
that
he
might
stay
over
from
time
to
time
in
the
bungalow
but
no
she
had
been
left
alone
quite
alone
except
for
painful
three
day
period
when
she
had
played
to
and
never
have
done
it
she
herself
automatically
in
the
silent
night
when
she
could
not
sleep
never
really
meant
to
was
just
upset
never
have
done
it
she
had
buried
andrew
in
the
soft
earth
beneath
the
table
in
the
garden
like
tiny
corpse
she
did
not
like
knowing
it
was
there
some
dark
evening
soon
the
night
before
refuse
collection
day
she
would
it
up
again
and
slip
it
into
neighbour
bin
howard
had
not
mentioned
the
needle
to
her
or
to
anyone
he
had
not
asked
her
why
she
had
run
away
when
she
saw
him
shirley
found
