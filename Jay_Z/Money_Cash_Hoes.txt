J-A-Y: I flow sick
Fuck all y'all haters, blow dick
I spits the game for those that throw bricks
Money, cash, hoes, money, cash, chicks
Sex, murder and mayhem - romance for the street
Only wife of mines is a life of crime
And since life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests
How can I not flirt with death?
That's life's enigma, long as life's within us
We gonna sin a lot and pray that Christ forgive us
Fuck it!
Ice the wrists and raise the price on these niggas
Y'all can't floss on my level!
I'll invite you all to get with us if your ball is glitter
When I go all the Harlem playas wall my picture
If you get close enough, you can read the scripture
It reads: money, cash, hoes. How real was that nigga?

Money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes

Flavors robust, platinum and gold touch
Yea I rap now, fast money, dun slowed up
Niggas try to stop Jay-Z to no luck
Roc-A-Fella foreva CEO, what! What?
Us the villains? Fuck your feelings!
While y'all player hate we in the upper millions
Whats the dealings? It's like New York's been soft
Ever since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings
I'm trying to restore the feelings; fuck the law, keep dealing!
More money, more cash, more chilling
I know they gonna criticize the hook on this song
Like I give a fuck...I'm just a crook on this song!
Bed-Stuy Brook-nam took on the world
Shit, I led a life you can write a book on
Sex, murder and mayhem, romance for the street
Man, and I tell ya, it'll be the best-seller

Money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes
