Can I hit in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse, if I was broke would you want me
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
Bitches kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a eight-figga nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a baller so you can shop and tear the mall up
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Can I get a fuck you
To these bitches from all of my niggas
Who don't l
Now will you bounce with me bounce with me
Bounce bitch, bounce

Can I get a fuck you
To these bitches from all of my niggas
Who don't l
Now will you bounce with me bounce with me
Bounce bitch, bounce
