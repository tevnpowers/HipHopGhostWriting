In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't glean clean
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' ho
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't glean clean
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't glean clean
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxing
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't glean clean
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang
