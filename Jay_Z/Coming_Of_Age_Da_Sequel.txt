It seems I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit

Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him

To the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down

You done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's your time to shine
Time to change up, no more second-in-line
[Memphis Bleek]
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga we Lex movers, V-12 pushers

Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby

Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
Records sold nigga, perfect your role

Yeah, you done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's your time to shine
Time to change up, no more second-in-line
