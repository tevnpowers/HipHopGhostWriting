Uhh, fin' to take it to da house
Just get on up and ("Get down!")

This song goes out to all the boys and girls
You want them thugs to come and turn yo' party out
You better take it to da house, (c'mon) now (uh uh uh)
(uh.. yessuh!)

Slip-N-Slide get loose
Mo' punch than your bowl of juice
And ain't nobody mo' jiggier then us
Stuff so ruff it causes head rush like what?
Give it to me bring it here
Don't stop girl shake it here shake it there
Let Money Mark get off in yo' derriere
We off da chain fo' the whole year
So if you look with a big ol' butt
Live in yo' own crib and make yo own bucks (yessuh!)
Hit me up, Tre+ dot com
And tell me where you from, uhh..

Smoked out, choked out, we get
Off da chain like we just broke out
You don't know bout me J. Dot
When I come though all the haters get hot
Cause I got mo' hoes, mo' dank
Mo' cheese in da bank, mo' rank
My dawgs on dubs, yours ain't
My dawgs do whatever, yours cain't

Cause we them niggas that's gon' make you
Get up out yo seat and ("Get down!")
..

And uhh, Deuce Pop' pimpin news non-stop an'

When I creep through the room with the Slip-N-Slide crew
Gimme room cause I'm buckwild man

Well order two mo' bottles of Crissy Cris'
And get drunk pissy while you listen to this
All you rookie-ass niggas don't try the shit
Some busta-ass niggas can't buy a hit
Gimme a break, and a beat I can vibe with
A Nik Kwest(?) video and a fine bitch
'Bout fifty-five spins and a mic check
And you'll play my shit
I never had sex that costed
I fuck so much I'm exhausted
And this new shit I'm flossin
I got that cause I ran with the Dolphins, huh
Slip-N-Slide's fin' ta take it to da house
New hot shit, fo' you to ride out
And for the niggas that tried there's nuttin left
Yo' ho must think we somethin else
Fuck fame, we out to get paid
Born and raised in the County of Dade

Cause we them niggas that's gon' make you
Get up out yo seat and ("Get down!")
