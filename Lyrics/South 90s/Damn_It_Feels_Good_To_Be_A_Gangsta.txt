Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fucking mouth
Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showing all his boys how he shot em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
Cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got em
And everything's cool in the mind of a gangsta
Cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five ayo 24/7
Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't sleep
And all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, cock sucking, pussy-eating pranksters
Is when the fire dies down what the fuck you gonna do
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Feeding the poor and helping out with their bills
Although I was born in Jamaica
Now I'm in the U.S. making deals
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean one that you don't really know
Riding around town in a drop-top Benz
Hitting switches in my black '64
Now gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangsta here is a smart one
Started living for the Lord and I'll last
Now all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy eating, cock sucking prankstas
When the shit jumps off what the fuck you gonna do
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga knows the play
The real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga Little Jake
Now bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of Little Miss Sweet
But catch the bitch all alone get the digits, take her out
And end up hittin' the ass with the meat
Cuz gangsta-ass niggas be the game playas
And everythings quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't tellin' off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All ya hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit
Hit the pen and let a mothafucka shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
Cuz damn it feels good to be a gangsta

("And now, a word from the President.")

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Gettin' voted into the White House
Everything lookin' good to the people of the world
But the Mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor gettin' down
Like lettin' a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supportin' me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans, that helped me win
I sincerely like to thank you
Cuz now I got the world swingin' from my nuts
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta
