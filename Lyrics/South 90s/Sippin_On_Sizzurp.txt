I'm trill working the wheel, a pimp, not a simp
Keep the dope fiends higher than the Goodyear Blimp
We eat so many shrimp, I got iodine poisoning
Fuck niggas make me sick with all that pinching and bargaining
You say that you a boss, I ain't believing that shit
You got the funny Geneva watch, with the Ferrari kit
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us
I got the red promethazine, thick orange, and yellow tuss
Hydrocodone on the hands-free phone
The '84 Brougham on them blades, twenty-inch chrome
If you got sixteen, you can get a bizzerd
I'm choking on that doja sweet and sipping on that sizzurp

Niggas scared to flaunt it, some niggas, they want it, want it
Some niggas, they joning, joning, but I be fucked up up on it
We're with the Mafia 6, and we ain't 'bout that bullshit
If we gon' get high, we gon' get high, and we gon' house a bitch
Two niggas all at the mouth, two niggas all at the ass
And plus, that syrup have a nigga dick hard all night and she cool with that
She popped her a pill of X, and drank on some orange juice
And just when you thought she was freaking, she done got super loose
Niggas come in by threes and deuces, all in circles like duck-duck-goose
All that want it can bone it, she on that X and that tootie fruit
Forty dollars for just one ounce ounce, plus
Tussionex is how it's pronounced
Niggas sipping and dipping and tripping, man, I'm 'bout all out

Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip

People always asking me, is the Three 6 high on that?
Rolling on them X pills, stuttering, pup-pup powder packs
Woah-wuh where the weed at, ain't like that we need that
NyQuil will slow me down, something that keep me easy
Nothing like that yella yella, that'll have you itching, man
Talking like, what's up, fool? Vocal chords sounding lame
In my days, all we did was chief out on a quarter pound
Gone on coke, eyes all bucked, this here shit'll knock you down
Knock you out, make you fall asleep when you're on them wheels
Ain't no doubt, hit me when I beep for this refill
Once again, on my wicked high, gotta have that drank
Yeah, my nig, y'ain't know? I feel like I'm gonna fucking faint

Nigga, tell me what you know 'bout Frank, Nito, and Young Guido
Paul and Vito, we play a tune that's sweeter than Pedito
With my Three 6 niggas pouring up in my southern credo
Quick, fast, we'll put it on your ass like John Bido
Cause you fronting rap sangers, be creamy like a Zanger
You ain't from the manger, boy, but you gets the middle finger
Humdanger, rum dranker, occasionally take
Your bitch to the telly and be a dick and cum slanger
When Big Bun come danger, nigga, ring your alarm
Sexy thang on my arm, cup of drank in my palm
And that crazy shit, I'm tripping on some skinny bitches
Something that's wholesome, Florida to Folsom
For the most, I'm steady sipping on some sizzurp

Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
