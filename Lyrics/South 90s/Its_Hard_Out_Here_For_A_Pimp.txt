You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit

In my eyes I done seen some crazy things in the streets
Gotta couple hoes working on the changes for me
But I gotta keep my game tight like Kobe on game night
Like taking from a girl don't know no better, I know that ain't right
Done seen people killed, done seen people deal
Done seen people live in poverty with no meals
It's fucked up where I live, but that's just how it is
It might be new to you, but it's been like this for years
It's blood sweat and tears when it come down to this shit
I'm trying to get rich 'fore I leave up out this bitch
I'm trying to have things but it's hard fo' a pimp
But I'm praying and I'm hoping to God I don't slip, yeah

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit

Man it seems like I'm ducking dodging bullets everyday
Niggas hating on me cause I got, girls on the tray
But I gotta stay paid, gotta stay above water
Couldn't keep up with my hoes, that's when shit got harder
North Memphis where I'm from, I'm 7th Street bound
Where people all the time end up lost and never found
Man these hoes think we prove things, leave a big head
They come hoping every night, they don't end up being dead
Wait I got a snow bunny, and a black girl too
You pay the right price and they'll both do you
That's the way the game goes, gotta keep it strictly pimping
Gotta keep my hustle tight, making change off these women, yeah

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit
