Everyday it's the same thang, L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still playa hatin, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is bangin ten times harder now
Niggas ringin they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn they car around
Rollin the window down (Hey can we talk it out?)
(NAH GET THE FUCK OUT!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck tryin to job hunt
Niggas got AK's, niggas is way crazier
Than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without lookin
Niggas walk by and blast without leavin a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your life reversed
Always tryin to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode
