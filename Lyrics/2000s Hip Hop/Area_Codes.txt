I've got hoes
In different area codes
Hoes! In different area codes

Now you thought I was just 7-7-0, and 4-0-4?
I'm worldwide, bitch act like y'all don't know
It's the abominable ho man
Globe-trot international post man
Neighbor-dick dope man
7-1-8's, 2-0-2's
I send small cities and states I-O-U's
9-0-1, matter fact 3-0-5
I'll jump off the G4, we can meet outside
So control your hormones and keep your drawers on
'Til I close the door and I'm jumping your bones
3-1-2's, 3-1-3's (oh), 2-1-5's, 8-0-tree's (oh)
Read your horoscope and eat some hors d'oeuvres
10 on pump one; these hoes is self serve
7-5-7, 4-1-0's, my cell phone just overloads

Now everyday is a ho-ly day, so stop the violence
And put the 4-4 away, skeet, shoot a ho today
5-0-4, 9-7-2's
7-1-tree, whatcha gon' do?
You checking out the scene, I'm checking a ho tonight
With perpendicular, vehicular ho-micide
3-1-4, 2-0-1 (hey)
Too much green, too much fun (hey)
I bang cock in Bangkok
Can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot
Think not, I'm the thriller in Manilla
Schlong in Hong Kong
Pimp 'em like Bishop, Magic, Don Juan
Man after Henny with a coke and a smile
I just pick up the motherfuckin' phone and dial
I got my condoms in a big ass sack
I'm slanging this dick like a New Jack

Is it cause they like my gangsta walk?
Is it cuz they like my gangsta talk?
Is it cuz they like my handsome face?
Is it cuz they like my gangsta ways?
Whatever it is, they love it
And they just won't let me be
I handles my biz, don't rush me
Just relax and let me be free
Whenever I call (I call), come running
2-1-2 or 2-1-3
You know that I ball (I ball), stop fronting
Or I'll call my substitute freak (hoes)
