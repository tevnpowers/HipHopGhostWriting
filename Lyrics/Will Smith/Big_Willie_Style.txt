Big Will the high roller
Strolling through with an entourage
Hard to camouflage when you living this large
I be smooth like Debarge with a five car garage
Out for the night with my squad and we be flossing down the fifteen
My whole aura gleaming
Who that kid in the green v
Envy brother scheming
I ain't thinking bout them
Racing chicks in the pink b.m
With my speakers tweakin'
Freaking off this weekend
In Las Vegas boss players all across the board move makers and shakers
Money can't break us but the places it can take us
Big will in the limelight rhyme tight
And we gon' have some fun tonight

Now how we do it
(you know it's Big Willie style baby)
Now how we doing it
(you know it's Big Willie style)

Now how we do it
(you know it's Big Willie style baby)
Now how we doing it
(you know it's Big Willie style)

I'm in a five star casino shutting crap tables down (boom)
Non betting willie watchers standing around
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes looking at us
How bad they wanna be us (parlay)
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
People stop and stare having drinks at the bar
A round for everybody with these big willie cards
From civilians to stars they wanna know who we are
It's me big Will Nas Escobar J.L. Omar
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to swift exit

Now how we do it
(you know it's Big Willie style baby)
Now how we doing it
(you know it's Big Willie style)


Now how we do it
(you know it's Big Willie style baby)
Now how we doing it
(you know it's Big Willie style)

Well now it's looking like a car show
Convoys and whips on the strip
Pulling up in the six making brothers sick
For real
Big Will household name, Entertainer
Gold handle cane and matching gators
Swerving lane
In pole position rolling deep like a coalition
In soul position and can rock a whole convention
Movie screens to the club scene
My whole crew looking clean
Shine with a diamond gleam
Step above where the players be
Don't hate me
One is where they rate me
Lately you could find me
Behind the door marked V.I.P
Eating grapes under the A.C
Big willie style is how we do it

Now how we do it
(you know it's Big Willie style baby)
Now how we doing it
(you know it's Big Willie style)
