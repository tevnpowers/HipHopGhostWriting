Yeh y'all can hear me
Make the drumming sound yeh
Lets ride yeh yeh
Be clear we here lights out
Eat here sleep here my house
Rhyme wasting time wasting
Feds want me caged in
Hope they got patience
More you win they want you to lose
I don't floss no more I drop jewels
Hope we might chill the heights real
Still we got fire that will melt your ice grill
Know the deal once we hit record
Hit the floor
New era this is war
Lord I'm the answer without a question
No evidence no possession
Stop stressing
Shit I got moves to make
Streets is dark but still I illuminate nigga
I could see the way
Till I see the end to me and BIG meet again yeh
