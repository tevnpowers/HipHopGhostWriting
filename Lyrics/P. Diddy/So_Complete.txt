I remember what you said to me, when you said it to me last night
We was talkin', and you reassured me everythings fine
When I woke up this morning to get some loving from you
I turned to one side, to my suprise, I wasn't layin' next to you(mmmm)
Why don't you get closed to me, I thought it was supposed to be
Me and you, you and me, so complete(so complete)
While you handlin' me this way, what was it?
You was talkin yesterday, yesterday, I could say
I seemed to be so complete, so complete

So I waited, and I wanted, cause I knew you would come
Hours 1, hour 2, hour, 3 hours, not at all
If I'm dreaming, wake me up
Cause I just about had enough, I had enough
I can not see, how would you ever let this happen to me
I still belive, that it was supposed to be
Me and you, you and me, so complete
So complete, so complete
If you saying that you need to leave, then be a man about it
And step to me, step to me, tell me please
And without me it's so complete, so complete

Won't you tell me right now what you want from me(what you want from me)
Cause it's been too long that you've held it in baby(held it in, oh)
Thought you where the one but, you just played me(you know you played me)
Now I feel that I'm so incomplete, yeah

Please, give me the respone I need
I want you to complete me, oh baby
Please, give me all the lovin' I need
Promise you will complete me, oh baby
Baby, what more can I say
Cause I want you to tell me
What it is you wanna do
Cause I want'a be with you
(be with you...)
