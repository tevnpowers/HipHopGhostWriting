I'm the definition of "half man, half drugs"
Ask the clubs, Bad Boy, that's wussup
After bucks, crush crews after us
No games, we ain't laughing much
Nothing but big things, check the hitlist
How we twist shit, what changed but the name?
We still here, you rockin' with the best
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks, ha!
Who's the boss? Dudes is lost
Don't think cause I'm iced out, I'mma cool off
Who else but me? And if you don't feel me
That mean you can't touch me, it's ugly, trust me
Get it right, dawg, we ain't ever left
We just moved in silence and repped to the death
It's official, I survive what I been through
Y'all got trauma, the saga continues

We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
