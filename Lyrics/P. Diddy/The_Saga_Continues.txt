Y'all niggas still talkin?
Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune?
What you have is a portion
Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and
So you better use caution, knowin I'm the boss and
I'm sittin on pyramids, flossin
I don't really gotta talk son
I can get lost and sit back livin off endorsements
I'm a pro, kid
Why you actin like you don't really know, kid?
Any records I broke it
Through the fame and the stardom, makin my mark on Harlem like Poe did
I said, here's your eviction notice
But you probably already know this
I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV
Or pick up your CD, P.D
