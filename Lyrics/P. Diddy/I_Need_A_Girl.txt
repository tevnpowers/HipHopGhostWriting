I had a girl that woulda died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Everyday she had tears in her eyes for me
I caught a case shorty took the whole ride for me (Thank you)
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl we was like brothers
On late nights we would play fight under covers
Now you gone can't love you like I really wanna
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you woulda had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy style
Shit is wild
Now these's days that I reminisce
About my little mami I'mma always miss (I miss you)
But long as you happy I'mma tell you this
Ain't nothin' that's broke that we can't fix
Mamacita

This nigga Diddy be chillin' with the prauda mamis
Posted up with the chick with the hottest body
Yo shorty all on me little hot tamale
(But I'mma ride for you Daddy) Then I got you mami
Cause all I wanna do is take care of you
And do things that the playas ain't prepared to do
Like if I rock ice you gon' wear it too
Fuck wit me I have the whole world stare at you
You feel me girl?
