And here we go
Aiyyo, let's get it where it needs to be
Tuned in to the, P-the-D, please believe
I told y'all it's on for life
The only bars I ever be behind is the one's I co-write
Hold it down, hold the crown
What I gotta brag for? Y'all should know by now
Cats talk this and that, so we rip the track
This a fact, it's a wrap, uh!
