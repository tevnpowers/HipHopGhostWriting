Yeah, uhh
Let's blow the roof off (roof off) let's ride out (ride out)
Let's try to put these city lights out (lights out)
Just flow with me (flow with me)
It's Diddy with some niggas that y'all know with me
(Who?) Eightball & MJG (that's right)
We got it man (c'mon) from Harlem to Tennessee
Let's roll through 'em, how I call it is how I see it (that's right)
Let yourself go (self go) the way I keep it real
With a smile that reminds you of my Bentley front grill (ehehe)
Yes it's on again (c'mon) to a place near you
I'm lookin out my rearview, fresh gear too (yeah)
Holla at your man (holla at him) I'm clean and I'm tight (c'mon)
That's all day and night, these shoes fit me right
Just bendin corners - know just where you can find
Me picture this (picture this) you only have to use yo' mind
What you know good (you know good)
It's your world and I'm just in it (what?)
It's just the way that God must have meant it
Speak of the man
