Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times

Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

Happy days are here again
The time is right for makin' friends
Let's get together, how 'bout a quarter to ten?
Come tomorrow, let's all do it again

Boys will be boys, better let them have their toys
Girls will be girls, cute pony tails and curls
Must put an end, to this stress and strife
I think I want to live the sporting life

Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times

Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

A rumor has it that it's getting late
Time marches on, just can't wait
The clock keeps turning, why hesitate?
You silly fool; you can't change your fate
Let's cut a rug, a little jive and jitterbug
We want the best, we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag; participate
Clams on the half shell, and roller-skates, roller-skates

Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times

Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times

A rumor has it that it's getting late
Time marches on, just can't wait
The clock keeps turning, why hesitate?
You silly fool; you can't change your fate
Let's cut a rug, a little jive and jitterbug
We want the best, we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag; participate
Clams on the half shell, and roller-skates, roller-skates

Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times
