I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in a zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach us all to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them high, And I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on!!!
Let's HOPE!

Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Let's be hopeful!

I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people comin up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have 'em trippin of the joy I bring, (shiit)
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers staying strong
You can make it whether you wit him or your man's gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on them priests like they did R. Kelly
And I wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish that enemies could talk
And that super homie Christopher Reeve could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game
Let's HOPE

Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Let's be hopeful!

Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always so optimistic
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mr. King "Why can't we all just get along"
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!
And let's HOPE

Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Let's be hopeful!

Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
