First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp like THISSSSS
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit there was something in the air
Yea, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed
Uh, labeled a misfit, a bandit
Kakunk Kakunk Kakunk!
His neighbors couldn't stand it so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop 'til after dark
Yea, when they said, "It's getting late in here
...so I'm sorry young man there's no skating here"

And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push
Coast - and away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push
Coast - so come and skate with me
Just a rebel, looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast

My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yea, no helmet, hellbent on killing himself
That's what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what what was happening to him now
Uh, he said I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two
She said Bow, I weigh 120 pounds
Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here
So she took him to a spot, he didn't know about
Something odd in the apartment parking lot
She said I don't normally take dates in here
Security came and said, "I'm sorry there's no skating here"

And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away they roll, just lovers intertwined
With no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast

Before he knew he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
Any escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy they needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs
Uh, and their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, "There's no skating here"

And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push
Coast - and away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause wth no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push
Coast - so come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast
