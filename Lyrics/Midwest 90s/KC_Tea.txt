At my place with full of women lettin' time pass
With Hennesey, Sprite and lemon baby I mash
Drunk as a skunk but the second one im on your fine ass

We grink the Hennesey and lemon where ever we go
Then add the Sprite from seven was me yo
Then me a Kalli named it in a Las Vegas casino

Fill the cup full of ice first
Cause the Hennesey will melt a little ice and it might urk
Me when I'm all up on a little tight skirt
I need a fully loaded Kansas City tea to quenchin my thirst
If you ain't got no real lemon
Just let a little lemon or lime juice spill in 'um
I know alot of caucasian people don't really do the Hennesey
But the way I make it I will in 'um

A lot a men never sinned on the Hen
Where ya been boy boy where ya been?
It'll have ya wit her again and again
Even strong enough to do her lesbian friend
If you can't handle her then hand her to me

Even got it set up for the camera to see
I'm wit her but I'm really picturing Angela Yee
She ain't wearin nothing but blonics on her feet
KC Tea got me really supersonic in the sheets
Hittin harder than sticky icky chronic on the streets
So nice to wake up in the bathroom ain't no vomit on the seat
Bartender made it right and I'm sure because it tastes sweet like candy
