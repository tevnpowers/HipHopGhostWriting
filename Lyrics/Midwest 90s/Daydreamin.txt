Daydream
I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day

As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep him happy cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot cause I can't drive
Room enough for one I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sitting on the shoulders but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children

Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And now hold up your chain, slow-motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud cause the baby's sleeping
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
Me and my robot tip-toed 'round, creeping
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldn't see, had the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me
