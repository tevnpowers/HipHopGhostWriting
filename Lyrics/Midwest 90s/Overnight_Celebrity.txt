Why don't we play something these hoes'll like
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight

Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming "my, my, my, my"
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight

Why don't we play something these hoes'll like
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight

Why don't we play something these hoes'll like

Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife

I could make you a celebrity overnight

You want fame, you can take that path
Candlelights 'fore you take a bath
You got such a sensational ass
I'mma get you Jimmy Choo and Marc Jacob bags
I can cop her a 2003
Make her smile when she sees Spre's
I can get you on CDs and DVDs
Take you to BeBe's and BCBG
I can get you into places to be into
The people to know or show you things to get into
I wanna be your lover and your confidant
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can get ya girl
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see ya in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And I bet she gon' put a hurt on 'em hard in the party
And you know you kill 'em in the club we go
You was born to be a pro, how you know who's taking photos
And I love you cause you freaky with the door closed
Drop it to the flo', let that go when you roll slow
And I love it when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me and have a brother going "oh-oh"
Girl I love how you roll me right
I can make you a celebrity overnight

Why don't we play something these hoes'll like
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right

Come here girl, I could see you bored
Tell you you're the queen that I see you for
Take you shopping on sprees in stores
I'mma get you to the MTV awards
We about to do a show tonight
You looking good girl, show you right
Take you places I know you like
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Come here girl, you could hang if you bored
We could do plenty things plus more
I'm about to have you changin' in stores

We about to do a show tonight
You looking good girl, show you right
Take you places I know you like
I could make you a celebrity overnight
