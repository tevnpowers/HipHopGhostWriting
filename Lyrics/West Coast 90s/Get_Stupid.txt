When we pull up to the light, the people all stare
Four niggas in the Benz with the dreadlock hair
Smoke everywhere, wavin at Madeline
On them woodgrain Davins with the license plate rattlin'
Doin what we want to, hangin out the sunroof
Mental, we ignorant, boy we go dumb dude
Gas break dip, we call it yokin'
Do a donut in yo whip, we call it dosin'
Get stupid, is what we do good
Ghost ride the whip while we dancing on the hood
I'm amped feeling good, p I'm hyphy
In a bitch face with a thizz face off a Nike
The women like me, im dipped in butta
I'll rob your brotha pimp the blood out your motha
I'm mister stupid doo doo dumb
Sumthin Terrible, tell em how we come

We go S - T - U - P - I - D
When we go to the club we dont need ID
Everywhere we go its a party yall
We gon get it crackin like the Mardi Gras
Get stupid
Get stupid
Get stupid
Get stupid
Go stupid
Go stupid
Go stupid
Come and go stupid with me

I'm a dog, hound, Crestside clown
Gig so hard make my pants fall down
This beat pounds, cutty where'd you get it?
Oh you ain't know, Dr. Dre did it

I come wit it, rappin and rhymin
Dancin, pantomimin, actin like im drivin
Then switch it up, dance like im fishin
See in the bay area we dance a lil different
The bay bounce to thizzle, the west coast wizzle
Do the get stupid, come fuck with Drizzle
Call the hospital, he's having convulsions
No he's gettin stupid, in his load yokin
Is the store still open?
We need Heem, that Privelege thing...yadadamean?
All in the throw like yee
S - T - U - P - I - D

We go S - T - U - P - I - D
When we go to the club we dont need ID
Everywhere we go its a party yall
We gon get it crackin like the Mardi Gras
Get stupid
Get stupid

Get stupid
Go stupid
Go stupid

Come and go stupid with me

Allright, let me tell you why we call this thing stupid
Cause when I dance the chicks say "you stupid"
You can do it, it ain't that hard
Baby get dumb, act like a retard
Shake ya hair, make it blow in the air
You gotta get into it, growl like a bear
Now say whaaa! "what?" no whaaa!
Do the damn thing girl cut that shit up
Fill ya cup, dont be no punk
It don't look right if you really ain't drunk
Come on, repeat after me we go S - T - U - P - I - D

We go S - T - U - P - I - D
When we go to the club we dont need ID
Everywhere we go its a party yall
We gon get it crackin like the Mardi Gras
Get stupid

Get stupid
Get stupid
Go stupid
Go stupid
Go stupid
Come and go stupid with me
