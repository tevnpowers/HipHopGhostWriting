I'm out of this world, not your run of the mill'n
My name is furl I'm the owner of the building
I'm a stoner and I'm chillin with two bitches like Jack
I pimps and I mac drive a Benz and a 'lac
Man I've been in the back wit the groupies and the stars
I've been out front with the thugs and the guards
I've been in the yard with the Mexican mafia
And I only run with niggas that'll kill and die for ya
I'm popular, I'm a rap star
But I live like a rock star running from the cop cars
I drop bars wit slaps that Knock hard and I charge for this dick extra large
I'm sicker than SARS higher than Mars and I treat my bitch like an ATM card

I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself

She's in the buildin and she's feelin herself
She's lookin bad man I'm willing to help
Stop it baby you're killin' yourself
Come on I got your back you could chill in my Delt'
I'm feelin myself too
Man imagine some of the things we can do
You under me
Me under you
Then we can catch the Liquor store before 2
We can hit my nigga and go get some shrooms
And if you still want to kick it we can go get a room
It won't cost you much, I'm a good buy
Dick-on-discount? bitch good bye!
What do I look like mr. Frank Fuck for Free
No Dough Ho you can't fuck with me
Get the fuck out
Bitch you still in my Delt'
You full of shit and I'm feelin' myself

I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself

I'm a West Coast Bad Boy
I represent it
"Dre, that's a bad toy, is it rented?"
Hardy har har very funny
You don't hear my tummy
I gets my money
My stomach ain't growlin
I'm stylin' and wildin', drinkin' Vodka straight fuck a Long Island
I want my own Island bet you I'm a get it
I switch hit and play with both mitts
Pack a four-fifth I'm after your bitch
He ain't doing it right she's after your scritch
And I'm after hers with these macking words, nerd
I thought squares, stayed sharp
You're nothing but a mark in a bucket Skylark
I'm playing my part
I'm mr. Furly
Quit interrupting I'm talkin' to your girly

I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
