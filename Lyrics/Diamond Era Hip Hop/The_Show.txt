Ladies and gentlemen
The most exciting stage show you've ever witnessed
Appearing live, Doug E Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew

Excuse me Doug E Fresh
Yes?
Have you ever seen a show with fellas on the mic
With one minute rhymes that don't come out right
They bite, they never write, that's not polite
Am I lying?
No, you're quite right
Well tonight on this very mic you're about to hear
We swear, the best darn rappers of the year
So, so, cheerio, yell, scream bravo
Also, if you didn't know this is called The Show

A-yo Doug
What?
Put your Ballys on
Yo Rick, I was about to but I need the shoehorn
Why?
Because these shoes always hurt my toe
Six minutes...
Six minutes...
Six minutes Doug E Fresh you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh uh uh on
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh uh uh on
Uh uh on

Here we go (here we go) come on (come on)
Here we go (here we go) come on (come on)
Yo, where's Will and Barr?
Well I don't know they're late
Told 'em the time, oh I forgot the date
Man, you did it again, oh no
Yo, here we go, come on, here we go, come on
Here we go, did you miss the show
No, no, no-no-no no we didn't
No no-no-no no-no-no no we didn't
No we didn't, well don't get us wrong
Excuse me Doug E...
Excuse me Doug E...
Excuse me Doug E Fresh you're on
Uh uh on

Well it started off on 8th Avenue
When I made up the name called the Get Fresh Crew
It was me, my two DJs Chill Will and Barry B
And my right hand man Ricky D
I used to rap and sing, make sounds and things
And for example, here's a telephone ring

{Ring, ring} Hello, is Doug E Fresh in?
No, he's not in right now {click}

But anyway, no more delay
Just check out the new style I display
Now you got to be (fresh)
To rock with (fresh)
And I'm D-O-U-G-I-E (fresh)
And I'm known for the... {Doug E Fresh beatbox}
Not for the... {Fat Boys beatbox}
The human beat box or the entertainer
No other title can fit me plainer
In a passing generation, I am a remainer
And I'm also known as the beatbox trainer
Cashing checks, make sound effects
And after I finish rocking, Slick Rick is on next
(You know it) Slick Rick!

Well, here's a little something that needs to be heard
Doug, I was going downtown (word, Rick?) Word!
(Sure) all alone, no one to be with
Stepped on the D-Train at 205th
I saw a pretty girl (so?) so I sat beside her
Then she went roar like she was Tony the Tiger
I said hold on, there's been a mistake
Honey, my name's Slick Rick not Frostie Flakes
(Oh, golly wolly) Cause she was raising hell
She said, um, my name is Maggie but call me Michelle
Michelle, my belle
Sont des mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
Slick Rick and 'em rock the house you know I'm saying
And when I'm on the mic there won't be no delaying
Bust a move, we show and prove
A-yo Doug, do that record Jam On The Groove
