It's time to bring it down, don't front on the sound
Check your thunderpound, it be Skillz blowing up from the underground
Now, don't waste your time and try to taste mine
I'm killing MC's and going low-key like baselines
Be hesitant, VA residents ain't friendly
Diss and I'll walk on your back like Mr. Benny
When my shit drop, all this wack shit'll stop
Till Janet stops, rockin' Planet Rock
Keepin' it real hot
I specialize in microphone satisfaction
Hackin' MC's who think Skillz be relaxin'
Straight from punchline ave, metaphor metropolis
I'm shockin' MC's like seeing their grandmothers topless
Watch this, check for my sequal
I make raps and niggas vanish like the Village People
Hey, you checkin' for me check 'round my way
They say Skillz don't play when he's representin' VA

Virginia's in the house [I said it]
V-A [so what you gotta say?]
Virginia's in the house [I said it]

Yo, niggas get pissed, MC's cease to exist
As I persist, to drill mics and fill Glock clips
Don't sleep, like Mobb Deep, I'm leaving brothers shook
While you debatin' I'm urinatin' on your rap book
I be Skillz see, the ill East Coast MC
All my peeps down in VA, this one's for you B
So don't give me nothin' I'm takin' my props
And I ain't stoppin' till my face is on the side of a lunchbox
The wack fold, cause they been told
Their rhymes used to be worth something like Mr. T's gold
Now I'm in, so watch me Kline like Calvin
I'm the Dread Man, you fucked up by lettin' me make an album (huh)
The outcome is ill, when I grip the steel
Don't be mad at me (why?), if you ain't got no skill
No questions, no second guessin' without a doubt
Niggas know my name and they know who's in the house

Virginia's in the house [I said it]
V-A [so what you gotta say?]
Virginia's in the house [I said it]
V-A [so what you gotta say?]

Is VA up in here? (HELL YEAH!!!)
Then here's a jam for you to spread across the state like welfare
I'm a special dread, that still be tactics
Doing MC's anytime, anyplace like Janet Jackson
It ain't about dirt roads and corn bread
Niggas be MC'ing, G'ing, war deeds and dread
After this pack it up, I'll tell you my plan
I'm on a VA tour with Kalonji my man
Check it, hittin' city to city like a horny trucker
This year, it's East Coast like a motherfucker
Misconceptions are coming back like reflections
Niggas who dissed, are now checkin' for my section
They wanna be down, they makes me laugh
That's like Brandy gettin' dropped and then you askin' for her autograph
You know the steelo and Skillz be in ya
It's just like that, nigga Virginia
