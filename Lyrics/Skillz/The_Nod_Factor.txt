I know you're tired of bouncing so check this here
We got the neck-breaking, club-shaking beat for this year
Yeah so peep the steelo and the flow
I got your head nodding cause your neck already knows
So pass the mic and watch Skillz rip fast
And have niggas up in parties catching whiplash
Slash the wack who trying to bite my style
Take your ass to the old school and part your fucking eyebrows
I'm coming through duke, it's 'bout to get set
So act like Wu, protect that neck
Eject? Wrong, I'm still tending to the song
I be blowing up spots like I was sending out mail bombs
Stay calm and keep nodding see
I'm like a black president (why?) cause niggas ain't seeing me
Has beens ripped off like bad skin so face it
After this joint we passing out some neck braces

I got your head nodding cause your neck knows it's phat

My tracks pack energy like nuclear reactors
I be Mad Skillz and this be the nod factor
Actor MCs smoke me take a toke
I'll fuck your career like the cast on Diff'rent Strokes
No jokes, I see hairlines and start aiming rhymes
My shit'll have hard niggas in Soul Train lines
Bumping with the big black broad named Belinda
Oh you rap? Don't say jack and walk quiet like a ninja
I injure beats so you should expect
To go to Cairo so I can practice checking that neck
You got set, and guess what, I'm the one that set it
You'll regret it cause my beats be employing paramedics
I wet it, yeah and it'll stay that way
I know you'll be back, you probably got some rhymes on lay away
But I be here freaking fat funk to make you sweat
Do me a favor and tell your neck that I ain't finished yet

I perfect raps to get under your skin
If you ain't nodding by now, either you dead or a mannequin
My friend, resisting ain't good for your health
Put your 'tude on the shelf and just go for self
Get help, get a drink and get a hottie
Get your groove on before he get his Glock and gat up the party like Gotti
I'm running things from the inside
Rap better wait because your style done died
Electric Company, Spiderman emcees saying nothing
Put your clothes on backwards if you feel like fronting
I'm hunting for beats, on point like cleets
With a brand new sound you can pump in the streets
It be the Nod Factor, rolling hard like Tecs
I'm Skillz for real bringing it to you something stank
This track will be in your ear like new wax
Now max and tell your neck veins to relax
