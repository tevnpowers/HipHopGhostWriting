If I should die don't cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas when it's real
Say word to Shawn my niggas
If I should die *echoes*

Don't cry my niggas it's been one hell of a ride my niggas
In the middle of the drought I flipped pies my niggas
I did joints with Mary J. Blige my niggas
I've eluded the coppers, got booted with Big Poppa
Skated through with the Caesar picadas
At high school got head by the lockers
Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
Rocked jewels dropped school still didn't fail
Rhymes still written well, hold court in the street
Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck
Sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me
Everybody around us become one for that day
To live life get your shit right & play
Don't get it twisted like braids if I'm missed it's ok
But life's short don't miss a day uhh

If I should die don't cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas when it's real
Say word to Shawn my niggas
If I should die *echoes*

If I should die don't cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas when it's real
Say word to Shawn my niggas
If I should die *echoes*

If I should die don't cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas when it's real
Say word to Shawn my niggas
If I should die *echoes*

I'd tell Big they're still hearin' his songs
Run into Pac ask him where we went wrong
Tell him life is miserable when ya dealin' in the physical form
Is everything that's invisible gone?
I need to know will I still feel pain or will it be ironic?
Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?
Can I reveal the game to all the hustlers
Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place?
Can I puff cigars & drink Cristal?
If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?
Can I still touch lives answer their "whats & whys"
Make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five?
If I should die...
...don't cry my niggas
