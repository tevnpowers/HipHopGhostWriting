Special K
Sunshine
Kool Moe Dee
On time
Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
We're the Treacherous Three, we got a new heartbeat

Party people got a brand new treat
On the well-known tune we call Heartbeat
But we jazzed it up and we broke it down
And came out with a brand new funky sound
Now I came here to get this straight
Our heart beat's not on a normal rate
Cuz when we get excited our adrenaline flows
And this is the way our heartbeat goes
A hop, skip, and a jump
But not a plain ol' bump
But but a bump, bump, bump, bump, bumpity bump
It's a brand new treat, and it sounds so sweet
The rappin' the music our new heartbeat

So feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
We're the Treacherous Three, we got a new heartbeat

You say we did research and we have found
That our heartbeat changes according to sound
Cuz when you're out on the floor, it's not only you
Because your heartbeat rocks the funky beat, too

So rock the heartbeat, let's rock the heartbeat
We're the Treacherous Three, we're gonna rock heartbeat

Get loose, get loose, Moe Dee get loose
Just rock heartbeat show 'em you got juice
Have fun (have fun)
Have fun (have fun)
Have, have, have fun

Apt to adapt to any hand clap
I can change my rap at a finger snap
With the slip of a lip I can move your hip
On a ego trip, ain't that a blip
Going up and down, I'm the talk of the town
I'm world renowned, with an emcee crown

Get loose, get loose, Special K get loose
Just rock heartbeat show 'em you got juice
Have fun (have fun)
Have fun (have fun)
Have, have, have fun

I'm Special K, not a doctor but I'm gonna prescribe
Gonna rock 7 to 5, rock your whole tribe
It's traditional custom when I'm in the place
Something dancing for joy no matter what your rate
I'm like a reoccuring riddler, all I am is a man
Like a well-known brand, always in demand
So let's rock, huh, let's feel the heat
As I rap to rhythm and the sound of heartbeat

Get loose, get loose, Sunshine get loose
Just rock heartbeat show 'em you got juice
Have fun (have fun)
Have fun (have fun)
Have, have, have fun

Not the number one ace, not the number one deuce
Just the trade here to say I still got juice
LA Sunshine at the drop of a dime
Not only one-of-a-kind, but I'm gen-u-ine
My heart can only beat in sunshine land
Cuz the ladies walk around with mics in their hand
You ladies love to hear my golden voice
Cuz I'm the only emcee and stand for main choice

So get loose, get loose, everybody get loose
Just rock heartbeat show 'em you got juice
Have fun
Have fun
Have, have, have fun

Well we're the Treacherous Three, we got rhymes galore
And this right here you heard before
So if you're feeling good don't mind the heat
Somebody say
Anybody say
Everybody, everybody, everybody, anybody
Everybody say, heartbeat
