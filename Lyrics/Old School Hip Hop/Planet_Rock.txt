Party people
Can y'all get funky?
Soul Sonic Force - can y'll get funky?
The Zulu Nation - can y'll get funky?
Yaaah!
Just hit me
Just taste the funk and hit me
Just get on down and hit me
Bambaataa's jus' gettin' so funky, now, hit me
Yaaah!
Just hit me

Just start to chase your dreams
Up out your seats, make your body sway
Socialize, get down, let your soul lead the way
Shake it now, go ladies, it's a livin' dream
Love Life Live
Come play the game, our world is free
Do what you want but scream

We know a place where the nights are hot
It is a house of funk
Females and males
Both headed all for the disco

The D.J. plays your favorite blast
Takes you back to the past, music's magic (poof)
Bump bump bump get bump with some flash, people

Rock rock to the Planet Rock, don't stop
Rock rock to the Planet Rock, don't stop

The Soul Sonic Force - Mr. Biggs, Pow Wow, and M.C. Globe
We emphasize the show, we got ego
Make this your night, just slip it right, and by day
As the people say, live it up, shucks
No work or play, our world is free
Be what you be - be

Rock rock to the Planet Rock, don't stop
Rock rock to the Planet Rock, don't stop

You're in a place where the nights are hot
Where nature's children dance and set a chance
On this Mother Earth, which is our rock
The time has come, and work for soul, show you really got soul
Are you ready hump bump bump, get bump, now let's go, house

Twist and turn, the you let your body slide
You got the body rock and pop, bounce and pounce
Everybody just rock it, don't stop it
Gotta rock it, don't stop
Keep tickin' and tockin', work it all around the clock

Everybody keep rockin' and clockin' and shockin' and rockin', go house
Everybody say, rock it, don't stop it (Crowd repeats)
Well hit me, Mr. Biggs (Crowd repeats)
Pow Wow (Crowd repeats)
G-L-O-B-E (Crowd repeats)
The Soul Sonic Force

You gotta rock it, pop it, cause it's the century
There is such a place that creates such a melody
Our world is but a land of a master jam, get up and dance
It's time to chase your dreams
Up out your seats, make your body sway
Socialize, get down, let your soul lead the way
Shake it now, go ladies, it's a livin' dream
Love Life Live

Zih Zih Zih Zih Zih (ad lib)

Everybody say, rock it, don't stop it (Crowd repeats)
Everybody say, shock it and pop it (Crowd repeats)
Everybody say, ichi ni san chi (Crowd repeats)

It's the sure shot (Crowd repeats)
Say, Planet Rock (Crowd repeats)
It's the sure shot (Crowd repeats)

So twist and turn, then you let your body glide
You got the body rock and pop, bounce and pounce

Everybody just rock it, don't stop it
Gotta rock it, don't stop (repeats)
