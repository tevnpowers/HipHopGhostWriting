Just like Uniblab, robotic kicking flab
My flavor be the badder chitter-chatter, madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my spit come out fatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand
Now hold up, let's make this official
Everybody let's agree that MCs need a tissue
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you and I bet the Mack take off like an MX missile
No more of your whining on the charts climbing
As I make the funk kicking out more harder than a diamond
And if you didn't know who's rhyming
I guess I'm gonna say Craig Mack with perfect timing
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Craig Mack, 1000 degrees
You'll be on your knees
And you'll be burning, begging please
Brother freeze! This man's undisputed
In deep rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MCs for dinner
You're crazy like that glue
To think that you could outdo my one-two
That's sick like the flu
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time
Cause boy, the rhyme you're kicking ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around I'll knock you out position
No flav could ever dig a grave
For the Mack the power pack in black making cement crack
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MCs more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MCs shaking with this track that my man's making
Emcees'll run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MCs stop relaxing
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy watch the MCs I destroy and...

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
