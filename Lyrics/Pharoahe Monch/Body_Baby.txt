Oh!
Oh!

I've got just what you want
You've got just what I need
You want my body baby, so let me plant the seed

You are my heart's delight
You set my soul a fire
I wanna. Doin' you. You make me hot

If I know who that nigga and the other thinking it's wishful
Sick wit it with a ridiculous flow
Take over, make over, move over
Jokes over, flows over, who Told ya?

It's a down, except I flipped the script tho
From the window to the wall just get low
Rock and roll, hip-hop music, and disco
T dot O to Atlanta to Frisco

Rufis, oh yeah, with a new twist oh
So y'all can get a gist of the rhyme that I do not miss. I will not fail
Please take a glimpse at the time at your own risk. I will not bail

Fuck da boys, grab the flock. The planet rock
The fiends and the fan on the block
Team's scheme on the knock
My hand, you want, dreams of your man

Oh!
Oh!

I've got just what you want. (What I want)
You've got just what I need. (What I need)
You want my body baby (Body baby) So let me plant the seed. (Plant the seed)

You are my heart's desire. (Heart's Desire)
You set my soul on fire. (Soul on fire)
I wanna. Doin' you. You make me hot

Grab the master's plans with ease
Those seeds can't see past me
No patch in the plan, the raps are not flash
Free at last- We never recycle the same songs from last week

Thank God almighty , we are free at last
We went back to ash, before raps harassed me
No relax. Do not pass. Do not ask me
But you can get backstage where you can see ass free

Elope- The Goat
Nigga vote for ya boy
I hope ya lied to the rope and the board
Smokin the dope
Relate to the gate
To the words you wrote, with the moving the scales ya say:

I've got just what you want. (What I want)
You've got just what I need. (What I need)
You want my body baby (Body baby) So let me plant the seed. (Plant the seed)

You are my heart's delight. (Heart's Desire)
You set my soul on fire. (Soul on fire)
I wanna. Doin' you. You make me hot

I've got just what you want. (What I want)
You've got just what I need. (What I need)
You want my body baby (Body baby) So let me plant the seed. (Plant the seed)

You are my heart's delight. (Heart's Desire)
You set my soul on fire. (Soul on fire)
I wanna. Doin' you. You make me hot

How's everybody feeling out there?
You want my body baby?
I'll give you my body baby
You want it
I'll give it to ya
(mumbling)
You want my body baby?

Thank you very much. Goodnight
