Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita

Hey Bonita, glad to meet ya
For the kind of stunning newness, I must beseech ya
Hey, being with you is a top priority
Ain't no need to question the authority
Chairman of the board, the chief of affections
You got mine's to swing in your direction
Hey, you're like a hip hop song, you know?
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita

38-24-37 (uh, uh, uh!)
You and me, hun, we're a match made in heaven
I like to kiss ya where some brothers won't
I like to tell ya things some brothers don't
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
Only you and me, hun, the love never dies
Satisfaction, I have the right tactics
And if you need 'em, I got crazy prophylactics
So far, I hope you like rap songs
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita
