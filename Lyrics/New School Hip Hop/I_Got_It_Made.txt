I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican, but I'm speaking so that you know
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing
So listen to the lesson I preach
I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem
Full of knowledge from my toes to the top of my dome
I'm kinda young--but my tongue speaks maturity
I'm not a child, I don't need nothing for security
I get paid when my record is played--to put it short
I got it made

I'm outspoken: my language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I play it cool--cause coolin' is all that I'm about
Just foolin' with the girlies, yes I'm busting it out
I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use
I'm creatively superior, yo--I never lose
I never lost cause I'm the boss
I never will cause I'm still
The champion, chief one, won't lose until I choose
Which I won't cause I don't retreat
I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street
You're invitin' me, a titan to a battle--why?
I don't need your respect cause I-- got it made

I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin'
Make a million dollars every record that I cut and--
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Every other month I get a brand new car
Got 20, that's plenty yet I still want more
Kind of fond of Honda scooters--got 74
I got the riches--to fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies
Even got a little island of my very own--
I gotta frog--a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Gotta treaty with Tahiti cause I own a percent
Got gear I wear for everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent
So it really doesn't matter--how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes--daily
You burn me--really?
Think, just blink and I've made--a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked-- a million times
Damn I'd be paid--
I got it made

I'm kinda spoiled
Cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear--got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted leg--I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growing too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
When the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me--
I got the army brigade
I'm not a trader
If what you got is greater I'll trade
But maybe later cause my waiter made potato 'n' alligator souflee--
I got it made
