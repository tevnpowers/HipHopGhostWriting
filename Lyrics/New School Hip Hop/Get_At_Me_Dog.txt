What must I go through to show you shit is real
And I ain't really never gave a fuck how niggas feel
Rob and I steal, not cause I want to cause I have to
And don't make me show you what the MAC do
If you don't know by now then you slippin
I'm on some bullshit thats got me jackin, niggas flippin
Let my man and them stay pretty and I'mma stay shitty
Cruddy it's all for the money is you wit me
Get the bitches, and I'll commit the crime
And when it's on we transform like Optimus Prime
I'll form the head, roll out let's make it happen
If we ain't gonna get it wit them we'll take your cap'
Bust it off dusting off the softest niggas
Money with the biggest mouth, yo let's off this nigga
A novice nigga never made a sound
Breath too fuckin hard and you getting bust down

Yo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)
(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)

Yo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)
(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)

Nowadays it ain't looking to good for certain niggas, I'm hurtin niggas
(What you doin?) robbin niggas, jerkin niggas, stickin niggas
Cause they deserve it; when money got murdered
They know he died slow cus they heard it
The nigga ain't blew up the spot a while
And the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while
It just takes a light up to fuck the night up
Blow everything in sight up
Fuck around and I'll have your ass right up
When you mention some shit you wasn't able to stand
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand
The days are longer and seems like I'm facing time
I've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasin mine
I soak it all up like a sittin' fly
Cause nowadays gettin' by, nothing more than an occasional meal and
Gettin high, I live to die, That's where I'm headed
Let your man hold somethin, now it's all about you can get it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]
Well in the back wit ya faggot ass face down
Lucky that you breathin but you dead from the waist-down
The fuck is on your mind? Talkin that shit that you be talkin
And I bet you wish you never got hit cause you be walkin
But shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wonderin how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under they eyes like a surprise to the guys
That one of their mans was a bitch in disguise
Fuckin with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me hollar at you yo Baltimore shit (ah-oh!)
Knahmean? I'm just robbin' to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbin the street
When we starvin and we eat whatever's there
Come on you know the code in the street; whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, menas your man couldn't walk
After the talk, about him not being 11-33 to New York
Transformin-ass niggas'll get it quick
And yo for real that nigga K {Solo} can suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game to barely move me
Cause when I blow shit up
I have niggas fallin like white bitches in a scary movie
AHHH! You know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas it's like: "Protected by Viper, stand back"
What's this?, I thought you niggas was killers, demented
The fuck you want me to do with this cow
