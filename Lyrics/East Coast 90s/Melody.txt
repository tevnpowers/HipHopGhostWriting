Turn up the bass, check out my melody, hand out a cigar
I'm letting knowledge be born and my name's the R
A-K-I-M not like the rest of them, I'm not on a list
That's what I'm saying, I drop science like a scientist
My melody's in a code, the very next episode
Has the mic often distorting, ready to explode
I keep the mic at Fahrenheit, freeze emcees and make 'em colder
The listener's system is kickin' like solar
As I memorize, advertise like a poet
Keep you going when I'm flowing, smooth enough, you know it
But rough, that's why the moral of my story I tell will be
Nobody beats the R, check out my melody

So what, I'm a microphone fiend, addicted soon as I sing
One of these four emcees so they don't have to scream
I couldn't wait to take the mic, blow into it to test
Then let my melody play, then the record suggest
That I'm dropping bombs, but I stay peace and calm
Any emcee that disagree with me, wave your arm
And I'll break, when I'm through breaking, I'll leave you broke
Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke
So stand back, you wanna rap, all of that can wait
I won't push, I won't beat around the bush
I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to
You might try but you can't get close to
Because I'm number one, competition is none
I'm measured with the heat that's made by sun
Whether playing ball or bobbing in the hall
Or just writing my name in graffiti on the wall
They shouldn't have told me you said you control me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your money, pull out your cut
Pull up a chair, and I'mma tear shit up
My name is Rakim Allah, and R and A stands for "Ra"
Switch it around, it still comes out "R"
So easily will I E-M-C-E-E
My repetition of words is check out my melody
Some bass and treble is moist, scratching and cutting a voice
And when it's mine, that's when the rhyme is always choice
I wouldn't have come to say my name and run the same weak shit
Putting blurs and slurs and words that don't fit in a rhyme
Why waste time on the microphone
I take this more serious than just a poem
Rock from party to party, backyard to yard
Now tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods

The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp
I can swing off anything even a string of a harp
Just turn it on and start rocking, mind no introduction
Til I finish dropping science, no interruption
When I approach I exercise like a coach
Using a melody and add numerous notes
And with the mic and the R-A-K-I-M
It's attached, like a match, I will strike again
Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped
Put in a order to pursue with the momentum, except
I say one rhyme out of order, a longer rhyme shorter
Or pause, but don't stop the tape recorder

I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor
Melody arranger, poet et cetera
Extra events, the grand finale like bonus
I am the man they call the microphonist
With wisdom, which means wise words being spoken
Too many at one time, watch the mic start smoking
I came to express the rap I manifest
Stand in my way, and I'll veto of the word's protest
Emcees that wanna be best, they're gonna
Be dissed if they don't get from in front of
All they can go get is me a glass of Moet
A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet
I take 7 emcees put 'em in a line
And add 7 more brothers who think they can rhyme
Well, it'll take 7 more before I go for mine
Now that's 21 emcees ate up at the same time
Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doing
No fessing, no messing around, no chewing
No robbing or buying, biting, why borrow
This slob will stop trying, fighting to follow
My unusual style will confuse you a while
If I was water, I'd flow in the Nile
So many rhymes, you won't have time to go for yours
Just because of applause, I have to pause
Right after tonight is when I prepare
To catch another sucker duck emcee out there
Cause my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe
And after this, you'll call me your majesty
My melody

Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorized it
Eric B made a cut and advertised it
My melody's created for emcees in the place
They try to listen cause I'm dissin' them, so pick up your face
Shook off your neck as you try to detect my pace
Now you're buggin', almost doggin' off my rhyme-like bass
The melody that I'm styling, smooth as a violin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island
My wisdom is swift, no matter if
My momentum is slow, emcees still stand stiff
I'm genuine like leather, inclined to be clever
Emcees you beat the R, I'll say "oh never"
So Eric B, cut it easily, and
Check out my melody
